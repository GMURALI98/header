It was with the efforts of the learned Amicus Curiae<lb/> that we on the basis of the deficiencies as pointed out by the<lb/> SIT, and upon its recommendations identified each of the<lb/> institutions and accordingly we directed AICTE and NCTE, as the<lb/> case may be, to look into the deficiencies and recommendations,<lb/> of the SIT. It is after the receipt of the recommendations, we<lb/> proceeded to hear the matter and in some of the cases directed<lb/> AICTE and NCTE to conduct further<lb/> inspections.

Moreover, in majority of cases, no GPF or CPF is being<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 101<lb/> deducted or paid. Therefore, at the joint request of the<lb/> institutions, we grant time upto the commencement of the<lb/> next academic session to comply with the aforesaid<lb/> regulations as it has not been disputed at the bar that the<lb/> instructions issued by the concerned apex body with respect<lb/> to the instructional facilities have to be complied with in its<lb/> letter and spirit. Thereafter, if any institution is found<lb/> wanting, then needless to say that it shall be liable for<lb/> closure as it has already been put to caveat regarding the<lb/> shortcoming.<lb/> 87<lb/> During the course of hearing, learned amicus<lb/> curiae placed before us newspaper reports, wherein it was<lb/> pointed out that with nearly 50% of the seats in engineering<lb/> colleges across the country remaining vacant, the technical<lb/> education department is planning to merge institutes with<lb/> high vacancies and the officials of the All India Council for<lb/> Technical Education (AICTE) who are aware of the<lb/> developments said that institutes with over 50% vacancy, and<lb/> good teaching and infrastructure facilities could be merged to<lb/> avoid being shut down. It has been recognized that for<lb/> engineering courses, like other courses, there have been far<lb/> less applications than the number of seats and vacancies in<lb/> institutes across the country have been increasing. In the last<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 102<lb/> five years, vacancies in engineering institutes approved by the<lb/> AICTE has remained over 47%, with 201617 witnessing<lb/> almost 54% seat vacancy. In December 2017 alone, six states<lb/> including Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal<lb/> Pradesh, Chhatisgarh and Telangana had requested the<lb/> AICTE not to approve new colleges as the demand for<lb/> engineering seats in their respective states was consistently<lb/> low. The AICTE had acceded to requests of four of these<lb/> states after an initial inspection. Earlier this year, the<lb/> Maharashtra government wrote to the AICTE, requesting not<lb/> to grant permission to new diploma or degree engineering<lb/> colleges for 201819, which was accepted. Still, 42% of seats<lb/> in Maharashtra&apos;s technical institutes went vacant in 201819.<lb/> Not only this, about 800 colleges in the country are facing<lb/> closure for having poor enrollment and have requested to<lb/> cancel the admission for two years or to allow mergers.<lb/> 88<lb/> The aforesaid facts will have to be borne in mind by<lb/> us while deciding the instant petition. We would also have to<lb/> bear in mind the decision rendered by us in CWP No. 1102 of<lb/> 2018, titled as H.P. Private B.Ed. Colleges Welfare Association<lb/> vs. NCTE and ors., decided on<lb/> 14.9.2018, wherein the<lb/> Institutions aggrieved by the infrastructural, instructional and<lb/> other facilities which were required to be provided by them for<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 103<lb/> running composite J.B.T./D.El.Ed courses, had sought the<lb/> following substantive reliefs:<lb/> i. That the respondents may kindly be restrained<lb/> from applying retrospective revised norms<lb/> of<lb/> National Council for Teacher Education for B.Ed. &amp;<lb/> JBT courses of 2006, 2009 and 2014 w.r.t. the<lb/> infrastructural facilities for already set up B.Ed.,<lb/> JBT and D.El.Ed. Institutions.<lb/> ii. In the alternative, the norms and standards for<lb/> B.Ed. programme at Annexure P5 and for<lb/> D.El.Ed./JBT Programme at Annexure P6 as laid<lb/> down by National Council for Teacher Education<lb/> respondent No.1, to the extent to built up area for<lb/> single unit of B.Ed. along with single unit of JBT in<lb/> a composite institution has been prescribed to be<lb/> 3000 sq. mts. instead of at the maximum 2000 sq.<lb/> mts., may kindly be quashed and set aside, in the<lb/> interest of justice.<lb/> 89<lb/> This Court, after taking into consideration the<lb/> material placed on record, found that the NCTE or for that<lb/> matter AICTE was insisting upon unnecessary high norms and<lb/> standards of area and despite there being a provision for sharing<lb/> of facilities, there was practically no such provision recognized<lb/> by it constraining this Court to allow the petition by observing as<lb/> under:<lb/> 44. Therefore, it is necessary to bear this aspect of the<lb/> norms and standards to be prescribed in mind for a<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 104<lb/> major debate before us centered around the right of the<lb/> NCTE to prescribe standards which are totally<lb/> unrealistic and extremely difficult to meet. Besides that,<lb/> providing of standards and making a provision therein<lb/> for<lb/> sharing of infrastructure has virtually been<lb/> rendered otiose, as the same infrastructural<lb/> requirement have been prescribed for running two<lb/> separate courses i.e. B.Ed and D.El.Ed/JBT.<lb/> 45. We otherwise see no reason why few of the facilities<lb/> like reception, toilet(s), library, computer lab, in addition<lb/> to the multipurpose hall cannot be shared by both<lb/> courses. Likewise, wherever there are technical courses<lb/> being run by the AICTE, in addition to the aforesaid, we<lb/> see no reason why the various labs like integrated<lb/> psychological lab, technologicalcumlanguage lab,<lb/> computer lab, audio visual room etc. cannot be shared,<lb/> especially when the same is specifically provided in the<lb/> regulations.<lb/> 46. It would, thus, be noticed that the Council has been<lb/> entrusted with the task of laying down uniform<lb/> standards to achieve planned and coordinated<lb/> development development of the teacher education<lb/> system. However, the issue still remains at large as to<lb/> whether while laying down these uniform standards,<lb/> has there really been planned and pragmatic or<lb/> systematic study with regard to the infrastructure viza<lb/> viz hill States. Undoubtedly, a special provision though<lb/> been made for the hill States as also the metropolitan<lb/> cities, Northern and NorthEastern States of India.<lb/> However, even though a special provision qua<lb/> infrastructure has been made for the NorthEastern and<lb/> hill States of India alongwith metropolitan States. When<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 105<lb/> it gets down to institutes running composite courses, no<lb/> real endeavour has been made by the Council or else, it<lb/> would not lay down such unrealistic norms which are<lb/> otherwise the requirement for institution running<lb/> individual courses.<lb/> 47. At the end of the day, we cannot feign ignorance<lb/> and be oblivious to the fact that these institutions have<lb/> spent huge amount of money to meet the requirement of<lb/> infrastructure, library, staff etc. and unfortunately the<lb/> intake of students is far far less than the one approved.<lb/> It is rather shocking that in some of the institutes, the<lb/> intake of student is barely two percent.<lb/> 48. Therefore, it is not only desirable but crucial that<lb/> more realistic and pragmatic standard for infrastructure<lb/> for the hill States be made by the NCTE and other apex<lb/> bodies who deal with the professional courses or else<lb/> this would only spell doom upon the existing<lb/> institutions. Therefore, it is imperative to lay down<lb/> norms or standard which are more realistic so as to<lb/> ensure that these institutions ultimately do not land up<lb/> or get concentrated in the hands of the affluent and few<lb/> elite.<lb/> 49. As observed earlier, the respondents No. 1 and 2<lb/> have not set off any area or made provision for<lb/> sharing of the infrastructural, instructional and other<lb/> facilities, even though after having mandatorily<lb/> provided for the same in its regulation, thereby it has<lb/> rendered the provision as otiose and redundant.<lb/> Therefore, its action of prescribing and thereafter<lb/> insisting on the additional built up area of 1500 sq.<lb/> mts., for the institution (s) already running both B.Ed<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 106<lb/> and JBT/D.El.Ed. Courses, being illegal, arbitrary<lb/> besides being unjustified, is quashed and set aside.<lb/> 50. The NCTE is directed to undertake comprehensive<lb/> study and thereafter make suitable amendments in the<lb/> NCTE Regulations, 2014 by setting off and counting<lb/> those areas towards common amenities which can<lb/> easily be permitted to be shared by the Institutions.<lb/> 90<lb/> Now, coming to the reports submitted by the SIT,<lb/> reports of the VT of the NCTE/AICTE as per direction of this<lb/> Court qua each of the Institutions and replyaffidavits filed by<lb/> the institutions controverting therein the objections qua<lb/> instructional and infrastructural deficiencies pointed out by the<lb/> aforesaid experts committees.<lb/> A a) </table>

            <table>91<lb/> Report No.5, pages 75 -83, deals with these<lb/> institutions. The conclusions drawn by the SIT are as follows:<lb/> (i) Shri Sheesh Ram Patwari, Patwar Circle Sanjauli<lb/> after survey of the area and scrutiny of revenue<lb/> records has submitted a report that Khasra<lb/> numbers 38 to 40 were in the name of Hill Grove<lb/> Public School through Shimla Educational Society<lb/> Trust and that the land measuring 8032 sq.mtrs<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 107<lb/> on the aforesaid khasras was lying vacant and<lb/> no building had been constructed thereon.<lb/> (ii) Dr. R.K.Shandil, Founder Trustee/Chairman of<lb/> Shimla Educational Society Trust had falsely<lb/> executed a lease deed in favour of the college on<lb/> 28.9.2006 giving half portion of total land<lb/> measuring 8032 sq.mtrs comprising khasra Nos.<lb/> 38 to 40 i.e. 4016 sq.mtrs alongwith the building<lb/> constructed thereon for a period of 30 years on<lb/> an annual rent of Rs.20,000/ whereas in fact<lb/> the said land is lying vacant and no such<lb/> building had been constructed thereon.<lb/> (iii) The existing building of the institute had been<lb/> constructed on Khasra Nos. 4,9 and 10 which<lb/> had not been leased out to the Trust as the land<lb/> comprising the said Khasras stands in the name<lb/> of Ram Kishan son of Devi Ram as per<lb/> jamabandi and Revenue Records.<lb/> (iv) The building plan of the existing building had<lb/> been prepared and completion certificate<lb/> unauthorisedly issued by Architect Naresh<lb/> Kumar Gupta, Draughtsman of HPPWD in his<lb/> private capacity on 10.6.2007 falsely certifying<lb/> that the total built up area was 1617 sq.mtrs.<lb/> on khasra Nos. 38, 39 and 40 whereas in fact<lb/> the said land was lying vacant as on date of<lb/> inspection.<lb/> (v) As against a minimum requirement of 4000<lb/> sq.mtrs of built up area for B.Ed., D.El.Ed. and<lb/> MBA the institute was having only 2300<lb/> sq.mtrs. of built up area. Even the institute was<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 108<lb/> not having sufficient built up area of 3000<lb/> sq.mtrs. to run B.Ed and D.El.Ed courses.<lb/> (vi) The same building plan had been dishonestly<lb/> and fraudulently submitted to NCTE and AICTE<lb/> to start B.Ed. D.El.Ed and MBA courses after<lb/> making some alterations/additions by hand<lb/> which would go to show that the documents<lb/> were manipulated/forged so as to meet the<lb/> requirements<lb/> of<lb/> NCTE/AICTE.<lb/> These<lb/> alterations/additions had been done by Shri<lb/> Naresh Gupta, Draughtsman of HPPWD and the<lb/> same are in his handwriting and bear his seal<lb/> and signatures. No separate buildings were in<lb/> existence to run B.Ed. and MBA courses and<lb/> both the courses were being run from the same<lb/> existing premises.<lb/> (vii) The institute was deficient in every respect in<lb/> terms of land area, built up area, library, labs,<lb/> computer lab, multipurpose hall, seminar room,<lb/> Common Rooms, toilets etc.<lb/> (viii)The institution lacks in faculty area in as much<lb/> as out of 7 faculty members only 2 were<lb/> approved by HPU and the remaining 9 faculty<lb/> members claimed to be on the rolls of institute<lb/> were absent. Even the Principal of the institute<lb/> was not present and had not been approved by<lb/> HPU.&quot;<lb/> 92<lb/> Based upon the aforesaid conclusions, the SIT<lb/> has prayed for the registration of criminal case against<lb/> Dr.R.K.Shandil, Founder TrusteecumChairman of the<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 109<lb/> Society and Sh. N.K. Gupta for obtaining recognition/<lb/> affiliation on the basis of false and fabricated documents<lb/> regarding the land and building constructed there upon and<lb/> in addition thereto misrepresenting the facts from NCTE and<lb/> SIT through various affidavits.<lb/> 93<lb/> The report submitted by the SIT is contested by<lb/> the institutions. In the initial reply filed by these institutions,<lb/> which is available at page 351 of the paper book, it is pointed<lb/> out that initially the Founder TrusteecumChairman Dr.<lb/> R.K. Shandil and Smt. Sunita Shandil as a trustee, were<lb/> running a Senior Secondary Public School in the name of<lb/> &apos;Hill Grove Public School&apos; from land comprised in Khewat No.<lb/> 30 min, Khatauni No. 69 min, Khasra Nos. 71/1 and 69 total<lb/> measuring 10 bighas and 7 biswas situated at Mauza<lb/> Chamiana, Pargana Chhabrogti, Tehsil and District Shimla.<lb/> However, lateron during the course of construction it was<lb/> pointed out by the revenue officials that one Khasra No. i.e.<lb/> 71/1 had been wrongly mentioned as 72/2 in the trust deed<lb/> dated 15.3.1999, therefore, vide supplementary trust deed<lb/> dated 8.6.1999 the said mistake was rectified. In the year<lb/> 1998, the Shimla Educational Society Trust applied to the<lb/> Government of Himachal Pradesh for &apos;No Objection<lb/> Certificate&apos; (NOC) for running MBA course, but the same did<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 110<lb/> not materalise and, therefore, the Shimla Educational Society<lb/> Trust applied to National Council for Teachers Education (for<lb/> short NCTE), for running B.Ed. course in the name of<lb/> </table>
<lb/> 
            <figDesc>Shimla College of Education in the year 2005. Thereafter, the<lb/> Shimla Educational Society Trust executed lease deed dated<lb/> 28.9.2006 giving half portion of land i.e. 4016 square meters<lb/> to Shimla College of Education for running Teacher Training<lb/> Courses viz., B.Ed., J.B.T., D.El.Ed., M.Ed. Etc.<lb/> </figDesc>
<lb/> 
            <note>Subsequently, the Trust made addition of 1000 square<lb/> meters in the built up area with separate entrance and<lb/> infrastructure and began to run MBA course.<lb/> 94<lb/> As regards the certificate issued by Architect<lb/> N.K. Gupta of HPPWD unauthorizedly certifying the total<lb/> built up area as 1617 sq.mtrs, it is averred that the SIT is<lb/> guilty of presenting the incorrect picture with regard to the<lb/> building plan as it has ignored the duly approved building<lb/> plans submitted to the NRC/NCTE seeking recognition of<lb/> D.El.Ed. Course having total built up area of 3985 sq.mtrs. A<lb/> copy of the plan has also been annexed with the reply.<lb/> Thereafter, the institution has controverted the pointwise<lb/> deficiencies as pointed out by the SIT alongwith material<lb/> documents.

            <note>111<lb/> 95<lb/> At this stage, we may note that some of the<lb/> institutions have already approached the Himachal Pradesh<lb/> University for initiating steps for conducting interviews and<lb/> the University, in turn, has already drawn up a curriculum,<lb/> as is evident from the affidavit filed on its behalf as available<lb/> at Pages 13711393, 1400, 1403, 366 to 2740, respectively.<lb/> 96<lb/> Thereafter, the institution filed another affidavit<lb/> on 18.5.2018 wherein it was stated that the deficiencies<lb/> pointed out by the SIT have already been adjudicated upon<lb/> by this Court in CWP No. 1217 of 2016 titled Shimla<lb/> Education Society Trust and another vs. National Council for<lb/> Teachers Education and others vide judgment dated<lb/> 8.11.2016 whereby the institutes were permitted to start the<lb/> course in question i.e. D.El.Ed course for the session 2015<lb/> 17 subject to their transferring the land and built up area<lb/> thereupon in the name of the institution within a period of<lb/> four weeks and the said directions were complied with within<lb/> the stipulated period. A Review Petition No. 5 of 2017 was<lb/> preferred by the NCTE/NRC for reviewing the aforesaid order<lb/> which was dismissed vide order dated 12.6.2017. However,<lb/> still the NCTE/NRC failed to issue letter of recognition for the<lb/> D.El.Ed. course which compelled the institution to approach<lb/> this Court by way of CWP No. 151 of 2017 and vide interim<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> .

            <table>Education.<lb/> 97<lb/> Thus, it is contended that the SIT has raised<lb/> totally frivolous and incorrect objections against this<lb/> institution. It is further averred that subsequently the High<lb/> Court of Delhi in its judgment dated 5.6.2017 rendered in<lb/> WP(C) No.3976 of 2017 directed the NRC/NCTE to issue<lb/> </table>
<lb/> 
            <note>recognition order within four weeks and even the SLP No.<lb/> 17013/2017 filed by NCTE against the aforesaid judgment<lb/> was dismissed on 17.7.2017. It is thereafter clarified that<lb/> Sheesh Ram, Patwari, Patwar Circle, Sanjauli, in the<lb/> presence of the Trustee clearly pointed out that the building<lb/> of the institute was situated over the land comprised in<lb/> Khasra No. 38. However, for the reasons best known to it, the<lb/> SIT called another Patwari, who had not even conducted any<lb/> survey of the area and stated that the building was not<lb/> situated over khasra No. 38 but the same was on some other<lb/> khasra number. It has been clarified that Khasra Nos. 38 to<lb/> 40 measuring 8;032 sq.mtrs. are in the name of Hill Grove<lb/> Public School Vaitamam (through) Shimla Educational<lb/> Society Trust and Dr.R.K.

<lb/> 
            <note>98<lb/> It has further been averred that even the<lb/> Principal Secretary (Higher Education), to the Govt. of<lb/> Himachal Pradesh constituted an inquiry committee to<lb/> enquire into the matter relating to the ownership and<lb/> possession of the land comprised in Khata/Khatauni No.<lb/> 99/226, Khasra Nos. 38, 39 &amp; 40 measuring 8,032 sq.mtrs.<lb/> situated at revenue village Chamyana, Tehsil and District<lb/> Shimla pursuant to the communication dated 24.3.2017<lb/> from the NRC/NCTE. The Committee found that the College<lb/> building is over Khasra No. 8. Therefore, it is not<lb/> understandable how the building is being found to have been<lb/> constructed over different khasra numbers by different<lb/> committees when the fact of the matter is that the building is<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> <note>situated over khasra No. 38. That apart, since the entire land<lb/> comprised in Khasra Nos. 4, 8, 9, 10, 38, 39, 40 etc. has<lb/> already been transferred in the name of Shimla Education<lb/> Society Trust (which is managing Shimla College of<lb/> Education), therefore, the further question viz. over which of<lb/> these khasra numbers the college building has been<lb/> constructed, becomes immaterial.<lb/> 99<lb/> At this stage, we may now advert to the<lb/> inspection report of the Visiting Team (VT) NCTE conducted<lb/> pursuant to the directions issued by this Court. The<lb/> Committee has found the existing building to be situated in<lb/> Khasra No. 38 and in the name of Shimla College of<lb/> Education, which is an unit of Shimla Educational Society<lb/> Trust. It has further been found that earlier lease deed has<lb/> been cancelled and the land as well as the building has been<lb/> transferred in favour of the Trust and reference has been<lb/> made to the subsequent trust deed. However, the only<lb/> exception taken by the Inspection Committee qua the land<lb/> and building is that it is not clear where the building has<lb/> been constructed i.e. over khasra No. 39 and 40 because as<lb/> per the SIT report based on the document, the land bearing<lb/> khasra No. 38 is vacant.<lb/> </note>

However, instructional deficiencies<lb/> were pointed out in the said report. However, thereafter VT<lb/> again inspected the institution (pages 39133916) and once<lb/> again did not find any deficiency in the infrastructure and<lb/> reiterated its earlier observation. However, it appears that the<lb/> NCTE did not agree with the report of the VT by observing that<lb/> the Ashtha College of Education is running on a smaller plot<lb/> and the management has initiated construction work at a big<lb/> plot size of 3760 sq.mtrs., hence deficiency is not removed.<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 192<lb/> 259<lb/> We virtually cannot make out any head and tail of<lb/> the objections as raised by the NCTE.<lb/> 260<lb/> That apart, we find that the institution has filed<lb/> an affidavit to the earlier report submitted by the VT (pages<lb/> 37413813) wherein it is pointed out that the institution is in<lb/> possession of land measuring 3923 sq.mtrs., however, the<lb/> same was in two pieces situated at two different places at a<lb/> distance of 1 km. from each other and the built up area is<lb/> 1537 sq.mtrs.

The bigger part of the vacant land<lb/> taken by the Society was for the purpose of curriculuar<lb/> activities and the left out vacant area was being used for<lb/> building of hostel and residence of staff. The institution<lb/> otherwise has removed all the infrastructural deficiencies. As<lb/> noticed above, even the VT in its report has not pointed out<lb/> any substantial deficiency in the institution which could be<lb/> an impediment in the running of the institution. Therefore,<lb/> the institution is allowed to continue as before subject to its<lb/> removing instructional deficiencies before the next academic<lb/> session.<lb/> </note>

As a matter of fact, two lease<lb/> deeds of land measuring 2000 sq.mts. and 931.65 sq. mts.<lb/> had been prepared on 21.12.2006 and copies thereof have<lb/> been annexed as Annexure RB with the affidavit.<lb/> 356<lb/> As regards the premises of the nursing college, it<lb/> has been stated that the same are completely different and<lb/> the management and activities of the said college are carried<lb/> out in the said independent and different premises. In<lb/> support of such contentions, photographs have been annexed<lb/> as Annexure RC.<lb/> 357<lb/> As regards manipulation in the lease deed,the<lb/> averments have been categorically denied and it has been<lb/> averred that there was no need for doing so, especially when<lb/> the Institution has land to the extent of 2931.645 sq.mts.<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> .

This goes to<lb/> show that different statements were given by Shri<lb/> Rishi Singh from time to time to NCTE to suit is<lb/> convenience which amounted to misrepresentation to<lb/> the NCTE.

Evidently, this report has<lb/> been prepared at Delhi and, therefore, much credence to the<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 265<lb/> same cannot be given. However, we may notice that the<lb/> institute has given an undertaking on 13.06.2018 stating<lb/> that it wants to hire the building from Shri Kulwant Singh<lb/> on lease basis which is four kilometers away from the<lb/> existing building. As per regulations in vogue, the building<lb/> to be purchased on lease is not allowed and, therefore, this<lb/> objection of the NCTE appears to be valid because as per<lb/> regulations the building should be complete in all respects<lb/> and in any case should be under construction.<lb/> 379<lb/> The institute has tried to controvert the<lb/> aforesaid reports by filing affidavit (pages 57565831) of one<lb/> Shri Rishi Singh wherein it is averred that land in Khasra<lb/> Nos. 661 and 662 was purchased by Rishi Singh and his<lb/> wife, respectively, in the year 198182 vide two separate sale<lb/> deeds<lb/> dated 27.07.1981 and 13.05.1982.<lb/> The land<lb/> purchased by Rishi Singh was already having building<lb/> standing thereupon wherein one floor was already<lb/> constructed. In 1982, two additional floors were added to<lb/> the same and thereafter in the year 1999 three additional<lb/> floors were constructed over the same. Even though the<lb/> lease deed was executed by Rishi Singh and his wife<lb/> Harjinder Kaur in favour of Namdhari Education Society for<lb/> 30 years, however, during family settlement, the above land<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 266<lb/> was transferred in the name of Kulwant Singh son of Shri<lb/> Rishi Singh, who has not objected to the lease deed, as is<lb/> evident from the affidavit filed. However, it is averred that<lb/> even Kulwant Singh has not objected to this lease deed and<lb/> rather has given an affidavit Annexure RF to this effect. It is<lb/> thereafter averred that the deponent was also owner of<lb/> 1/5th share of land comprised in Khewat No.269, Khatauni<lb/> No.290, Khasra Nos. 425, 442, 448, measuring 130417<lb/> bighas and out of his 1/5th share, half share was sold to<lb/> Namdhari Education Society vide<lb/> sale deed<lb/> dated<lb/> 21.06.2008.<lb/> 380<lb/> It has further been submitted that the building<lb/> constructed at Mohal Bhojpur on which Namdhari College<lb/> is running, has been recently inspected by the Assistant<lb/> Engineer, HPPWD and has been declared safe in all respects.<lb/> Earlier to that, a lease deed was executed between Namdhari<lb/> Education Society and one Gurdayal, whereby an area<lb/> measuring 63.24 square metres has been leased out in<lb/> favour of the Society and the same is opposite to Khasra<lb/> Nos. 661 and 662. It is submitted that on this land the said<lb/> Gurdyal has raised a huge building which is being used for<lb/> the purpose of hostel by the Society. Lastly, it is averred that<lb/> at the time of its inspection the Society was fully<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 267<lb/> complying with the norms and even today as against the total<lb/> required area of 2500 square metres, out of which 1500<lb/> square metres should be builtup, the deponent is having<lb/> total land measuring 5000 square whereas, the built<lb/> up area over Khasra Nos. 661 and 662, Mohal Bhojpur alone<lb/> is about 2000 square metres. Therefore, the institution has<lb/> met the instructional requirement as per the relevant norms<lb/> of NCTE.<lb/> 381<lb/> Having gone through the report of the SIT,<lb/> reports of the VT and the affidavits filed by the institute, we<lb/> are clearly of the opinion that the institute should be<lb/> permitted to run subject to the condition that it completes<lb/> all the infrastructural requirements before the start of next<lb/> academic session i.e. 20192021 and that apart all<lb/> instructional deficiencies are removed by the next academic<lb/> session.<lb/> C a)9:<lb/> </table>

However, still the institution is in the process of<lb/> fulfilling the requirement as per 2014 Regulations and for<lb/> this purpose land measuring 2014 square metres in Mohal<lb/> Karehari, Tehsil Balh, District Mandi, is in the process of<lb/> being mutated in the name of the institution from the name<lb/> of Wisdom Education Society, which will be utilized for the<lb/> desirable<lb/> purpose of the society such as residential<lb/> accommodation for Principal/staff and students etc. It has<lb/> been averred that the institution has never misrepresented<lb/> any fact from NCTE or any other authority and the<lb/> allegations made by the SIT are without any basis. The other<lb/> deficiencies found by the SIT have also been controverted in<lb/> the said affidavit.

P .<lb/> 272<lb/> inspection and it has been mentioned therein that there is<lb/> no evidence to establish that the building constructed on<lb/> Khasra Nos. 63,67, 310, 327, 399, 403 and 406 and the<lb/> deficiency is not removed. Even otherwise, as per VTR, total<lb/> builtup area as against 3500 square metres is 1995.04<lb/> square metres and there are no separate toilets. As observed<lb/> that this report has been prepared by the officials while<lb/> sitting in the office at Delhi, therefore, much credence cannot<lb/> be given to the same as it is not based on physical<lb/> inspection. However, be that as it may, the institution has<lb/> controverted this report by filing an affidavit (pages 5225<lb/> 5228) wherein it has been averred that the inspecting team<lb/> of NCTE itself while visiting the premises on 12.06.2018 has<lb/> found it to be in possession of 1995.04 square metres built<lb/> up area of the building including staircase, corridor and<lb/> washrooms. Additional builtup area of 235 square metres<lb/> in one of the floors of the building being used for BBA/BCA<lb/> Courses has also been added to the teacher education<lb/> programme. In addition thereto, there is Principal&apos;s cabin<lb/> having 50 square metres area. Therefore, presently builtup<lb/> area with the institution is 2280 square metres. Apart from<lb/> that, 1161 square metres of land at village Bhangrotu and<lb/> the institution has also taken on lease 2014 square metres<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 273<lb/> of land at village Karehri and 550 bighas of land at village<lb/> Mathaneol. But, after coming into force of 2014 regulations,<lb/> the above said lands at villages Karehri and Mathaneol<lb/> became useless due to the requirement under the said<lb/> regulations of either the land being owned by the institution<lb/> or being taken on lease from the Government. The institute<lb/> accordingly arranged to purchase 480 bighas (3520 square<lb/> metres) of land in Mohal Badsu, Tehsil Sadar, District Mandi,<lb/> H.P. for creating the infrastructure conforming to the 2014<lb/> Regulations. Essentiality Certificate has also been issued<lb/> by the Director of Higher Education and the institution has<lb/> already applied for permission<lb/> to the Government of<lb/> Himachal Pradesh under Section 118 of the H.P. Tenancy<lb/> and Land Reforms Act for transfer of the aforesaid land, but<lb/> the same has been unduly delayed at the end of the<lb/> authorities. Due to withholding of necessary permission, the<lb/> institution has not been able to utilize the above said land<lb/> till date. That apart, even though the institution was<lb/> complying with the infrastructural requirements under the<lb/> old regulations, however, now the area in question has been<lb/> included and brought under the provisions of the Town and<lb/> Country Planning Area and thus has become amenable to<lb/> compliance of requisite floor area ratio, as a result whereof,<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 274<lb/> the institution is precluded from enhancing the builtup<lb/> area at its existing site at Mauza Bhangrotu. It is lastly<lb/> averred that the other genuine deficiencies as pointed out by<lb/> the SIT stand removed, save and except that the area of<lb/> library is 969.36 square feet as against the required area of<lb/> 1000 square feet.<lb/> 385<lb/> On the basis of the above analysis, we have no<lb/> difficulty in concluding that for the present, the institution<lb/> cannot be asked to perform the impossible as it has to adhere<lb/> to the floor area ratio and is not in a position to raise<lb/> additional floor area in view of the prohibition and<lb/> compliance of floor area ratio under the Town and Country<lb/> Planning Area. As regards the permission sought by the<lb/> institution under Section 118 of the H.P. Tenancy and Land<lb/> Reforms Act, the concerned authorities are required to<lb/> decide the said application as expeditiously as possible and<lb/> in no event later than the next academic session. In case,<lb/> the institution is granted permission, it will ensure that all<lb/> the infrastructural facilities, as contemplated under the<lb/> regulations, are completed by the start of the next Academic<lb/> Session from 20192021 and further in case no such<lb/> permission is forthcoming, then the institution may have to<lb/> close down some of the courses from the next Academic<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> .

In yet another affidavit dated 30/6/2009<lb/> for additional intake of 100 seats in B.Ed Course, Shri<lb/> Purushotam Sharma claimed built up area of 2090 sq.<lb/> mtrs. However, actual measurements carried out<lb/> during the course of inspection by the PWD reveal that<lb/> the total land area was 602 sq. mtrs with a built up<lb/> area of 1737.30 sq. mtrs which goes to show that a<lb/> false and incorrect affidavit dated 30/6/2009 was<lb/> filed by Shri Purushotam Sharma to claim approval for<lb/> additional 100 seats for B.Ed Course.<lb/> Apart from the aforesaid deficiencies, certain<lb/> essentials like Seminar Room was not available and<lb/> other accommodation like Multipurpose hall was<lb/> found to be inadequate to accommodate 400 students.&quot;<lb/> 443<lb/> On the basis of the aforesaid conclusions, it has<lb/> been prayed that a criminal case be ordered to be registered<lb/> either by the CBI or State Vigilance &amp; Anti Corruption<lb/> Bureau, Himachal Pradesh, against Shri Purushotam<lb/> Sharma, Secretary, Shiva Educational Society and unknown<lb/> others for obtaining approval for additional 100 seats for<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> .

It was also observed that MBA block was<lb/> under construction and that equipments were partially<lb/> installed for the said course. AICTE ordered another<lb/> inspection on 10.7.2009 i.e. after a period of about 15<lb/> days in which one of the inspecting officers namely Sh.<lb/> B.S. Sohi, Director UIET Punjab University, Chandigarh<lb/> was common. Surprisingly, no deficiencies were<lb/> pointed out<lb/> in the said report and the<lb/> recommendations were made for the approval of<lb/> session 201011. It is highly improbable that buildings<lb/> which were under construction as on 25.6.2009 were<lb/> completed on 10.7.2009 and the equipments<lb/> purchased and installed. The<lb/> AICTE HO issued<lb/> approval on 22.7.2009 for 240 Engg. seats and 60<lb/> MBA seats for the academic year 200910 subject to<lb/> the schedule prescribed by the State government and<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 331<lb/> affiliated University for the admission of students for<lb/> the said academic year failing which the appproval<lb/> would be valid for academic year 201011. The first<lb/> inspection for pharmacy was carried out on 30.5.2010<lb/> in which several glaring deficiencies were pointed out<lb/> and assuch the LOA was not recommended by AICTE,<lb/> NW RO Chandigarh vide their report dated 8.6.2010.<lb/> However, the society filed an appeal on 17.6.2010 and<lb/> appellate committee approved the issuance of LOA on<lb/> 13.7.2010.<lb/> During the years 2009 to 2015, a number of other<lb/> inspections, were carried out<lb/> at the instance of<lb/> Himachal Pradesh University and HP Technical<lb/> University but in every inspection several major<lb/> deficiencies were found in the said integrated complex<lb/> in respect of each discipline.<lb/> A surprise visit was made on 4.6.2012 by an Expert<lb/> Visiting Committee at the instance of CBI, CVO,<lb/> Ministry of HRD and CVC. In this report, the Committee<lb/> especially reported that the boundary walls were not<lb/> ready for use, civil/electrical work not completed,<lb/> boundary walls not made, stock registers of laboratory<lb/> equipment, computers, system software, application<lb/> software, printers etc. not presented, five programmes<lb/> running in the same campus, boys/girls common<lb/> rooms, cafeteria, stationary stoers not as per norms,<lb/> class rooms, tutorial rooms, labs for UG/PG less in<lb/> numbers, incomplete and not as per norms, seminar<lb/> halls do not exist, no power connection in the<lb/> laboratory, less equipments, no boundary wall, no<lb/> facility for handicapped, no drinking water facility, no<lb/> furniture available in Engg. &amp; Tech. and Management<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 332<lb/> programme rooms, deficiencies in computerization<lb/> facilities, programme level faculty not shown,<lb/> deficiency exists in administrative areas and that the<lb/> existing programmes were running in a polytechnic<lb/> college. This Committee did not recommend<lb/> continuation of the existing courses because all the<lb/> buildings were under construction and civil/electrical<lb/> works incomplete. Based on the said report, a show<lb/> cause notice was issued by AICTE on 24.7.2012 as to<lb/> why it should not be considered that AICTE was<lb/> misled by the Institute by giving manipulated/false<lb/> information, violation of terms and conditions in the<lb/> letter of approval and appropriate actions including<lb/> withdrawal of approval be not initiated against the<lb/> institution for nonobservance of the terms and<lb/> conditions of approval as also for misleading the<lb/> AICTE by submitting false information. In response to<lb/> the said show cause notice K.C. Society submitted a<lb/> reply dated 6.9.2012 wherein they claimed that the<lb/> buildings were complete in all respects and some<lb/> photographs were also attached.<lb/> From the various facts and evidence available on<lb/> record in the light of different inspections carried out<lb/> by different committees appointed by different<lb/> agencies, it is established that K.C. Educational and<lb/> Social Welfare Society had mis represented about the<lb/> completion of buildings as well as the fulfillment of<lb/> other norms laid down by the AICTE, HPTU, PCI and<lb/> HP Technical Education Board and the various<lb/> members of the committees connived with them and<lb/> by abuse of their official position as public servants<lb/> submitted false inspection reports to AICTE about the<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 333<lb/> availability of all the staff, equipments, machinery,<lb/> furniture, books, journals, accommodation, toilets,<lb/> drinking water facility, boundary wall, approach road<lb/> and other essentialities as per the norms laid down by<lb/> the various agencies of Government of India and<lb/> government of Himachal Pradesh and other agencies<lb/> and thus cheated them in the matter of obtaining<lb/> approval/affiliation for running these institutions.<lb/> However, a final recommendation in the matter about<lb/> registration of a case or otherwise shall be made only<lb/> after a physical verification of the site and examination<lb/> of the various documents available with the<lb/> management, which will be attended to shortly. The<lb/> final recommendation in this regard shall be made in<lb/> the next progress report to be submitted to the Hon&apos;ble<lb/> High Court of Himachal Pradesh.<lb/> 448<lb/> Thereafter, in progress report No.3 on the basis<lb/> of physical inspection and verification of the record, it was<lb/> concluded as under:<lb/> The Society was formed on 18/10/2008 and registered on<lb/> 24/11/2008. Further, on 08.12.2008 an Essentiality<lb/> Certificate for the purchase of land in Himachal Pradesh to<lb/> start Diploma/Degree level institutions was given by<lb/> Director(TE), Sundernagar (HP). Also on 27/12/2008, the<lb/> Financial<lb/> Commissioner/Secretary (Revenue) granted<lb/> permission to the Society to purchase land for the<lb/> establishment of educational institutions. In pursuance of<lb/> the aforesaid permission, the society purchased 22 acres<lb/> of land in Village and Post Office Pandoga Uparla, Tehsil<lb/> and District Una H.P. on 29/12/2008. The Patwari of<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 334<lb/> village Pandoga issued a certificate on 29/12/2008 itself<lb/> that the land was outside the notified area. The Asstt.<lb/> Town Planner, Una also issued a No Objection Certificate<lb/> on 23/01/2009 that the land did not fall within the<lb/> jurisdiction of Town &amp; Country Planning Department, H.P.<lb/> It may thus be seen that all these actions took place with a<lb/> lightning speed and all the formalities were completed in<lb/> less than a months&apos; time.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The Society entered into an agreement dated<lb/> 04/02/2009 with M/s Daljit Singh &amp; Sons, Ludhiana and<lb/> another agreement dated 23/02/2009 with M/s United<lb/> Construction Co. Chandigarh for the construction work of<lb/> the integrated complex. It is seen from the various bills<lb/> submitted by M/s Daljit Singh &amp; Sons that the construction<lb/> of the Polytechnic College, Administration Block, Workshop<lb/> of Polytechnic College Block and Hotel Management Block<lb/> was continuing till 30/03/2011.<lb/> 3.<lb/> In the first inspection carried out on 30/04/2009 by<lb/> a Committee constituted by Director (TE) with the objective<lb/> of assessing the feasibility of issuing a NOC in favour of<lb/> the said Society to start the various institutes, the<lb/> Committee observed that only some columns had been<lb/> raised on the ground floor for the Engineering and<lb/> Technical block with a carpet area of 1600 Sq. meter<lb/> approximately. The Committee further pointed out that<lb/> construction work up to plinth level had been done in a<lb/> case of MBA block whereas the construction work in<lb/> respect of Pharmacy Block had not yet stated. The<lb/> Committee also observed that supply order for some<lb/> machinery and equipment had been issued. The<lb/> Committee was finally of the view that Society was at the<lb/> beginning stage of the Construction for two programmes<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 335<lb/> i.e. Engineering and MBA whereas the construction of<lb/> Pharmacy block was yet to be started. The Committee<lb/> concluded that the NOC for the session 20092010 could<lb/> only be issued after verification of infrastructure being<lb/> constructed by the Society was completed and other norms<lb/> and conditions of AICTE and affiliated university were also<lb/> met. Another Expert Committee conducted inspection of the<lb/> proposed Polytechnic on 12/6/2009 but after inspection<lb/> found it difficult to firmly recommend the issuance of LOA<lb/> to the Polytechnic for the session 20092010 on the various<lb/> grounds mentioned in the reprot.<lb/> 4.<lb/> Another inspection of the said Polytechnic was<lb/> carried out on 30/06/2009. This Inspection Committee<lb/> also pointed out various discrepancies and recommended<lb/> that minimum basic construction for the first year was not<lb/> sufficient for the five courses and the finishing work of the<lb/> workshops and labs was in progress but the available<lb/> infrastructure was sufficient to run only three Engineering<lb/> Diploma Courses for which the finishing work was in<lb/> progress and may be completed in a week&apos;s time. The<lb/> Committee recommended for consideration of the case of<lb/> approval for three courses at that stage. The report of the<lb/> inspection committee was considered by the State Level<lb/> Committee in its 16 th meeting held on 03/07/2009, and it<lb/> was recommended that the letter of approval be issued by<lb/> NWRO AICTE Chandigarh for running three courses i.e.<lb/> Mechanical Engineering,<lb/> Electrical Engineering and<lb/> Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering for the session<lb/> 20092010. In view of this recommendation RO/AICTE<lb/> Chandigarh granted approval to K.C Polytechnic vide<lb/> letter dated 04/07/2009 for an annual intake of 60 seats<lb/> each in three disciplines namely, Electrical Engineering,<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> Electronics<lb/> &amp;<lb/> Communication<lb/> Engineering.,<lb/> and<lb/> Mechanical Engineering for the academic year 20092010.<lb/> Consequently, the HP Takniki Shiskha Board. Dharmasals<lb/> granted affiliation to the Polytechnic on 1519/10/2009<lb/> on yearly basis for a period of three years after conducting<lb/> the inspection to the entire satisfaction of the Board<lb/> regarding availability/creation of additional infrastructure<lb/> as per AICTE norms.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The 3 rd inspection of K.C. Polytechnic, Una was<lb/> carried out on 25/07/2009 by a committee to verify the<lb/> various infrastructure facilities and compliance of the<lb/> conditions laid down in Letter of Intent issued by RO<lb/> AICTE Chandigarh vide letter dated 25/04/2009. The<lb/> Committee opined that the institution had made progress<lb/> in providing the infrastructure facilities and setting up of<lb/> equipment and most of the deficiencies had been removed<lb/> except for the Chemistry Lab for which the work was in<lb/> progress and for which an assurance had been given by<lb/> the Chairman for its completion before stipulated period.<lb/> The Committee recommended the case of approval to be<lb/> considered for remaining two diploma courses in Civil and<lb/> Computer Engineering for the current Academic Session.<lb/> However, the SLC after considering the Inspection report in<lb/> its 17 th meeting held on 03/08/2009, decided not to<lb/> recommend any of the additional courses.<lb/> 6.<lb/> It appears that simultaneously the Society then<lb/> approached AICTE for approval of the various programmes<lb/> and an Expert Visiting Committee constituted by AICTE<lb/> conducted an inspection on 25/06/2009 for the<lb/> recommendations of State Government for 240 Engineering<lb/> seats and 60 MBA seats. In its inspection report it was<lb/> clearly mentioned that the buildings were under<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 337<lb/> construction, equipment were not installed in place and<lb/> workshop was under construction. It was also observed<lb/> that MBA block was under construction and that<lb/> equipment was partially installed for the said course.<lb/> AICTE ordered another inspection on 10/07/2009 i.e. after<lb/> a period of about 15 days in which one of the inspecting<lb/> officers namely, Shri. B.S Sohi, Director UIET Punjab<lb/> University, Chandigarh was common,. Surprisingly, no<lb/> deficiencies were pointed out in the said report and the<lb/> recommendations were made for the approval of session<lb/> 20102011. It is highly improbable that buildings which<lb/> were under construction as on 25/06/2009 were<lb/> completed on 10/7/2009 and the equipment purchased<lb/> and installed. The AICTE issued approval on 22/7/2009<lb/> for 240 Engineering seats and 60 MBA seats for the<lb/> academic year 20092010 subject to the schedule<lb/> prescribed by the State Government and affiliating<lb/> University for the admission of students for the said<lb/> academic year falling which the approval was valid for<lb/> academic year 20102011. The first inspection for<lb/> Pharmacy was carried out on 30/05/2009 in which<lb/> several glaring deficiencies were pointed out and as such<lb/> the letter of Approval (LOA) was not recommended by<lb/> AICTE, NW RO Chandigarh vide their report dated<lb/> 08/06/2010. However, the Society filed an appeal on<lb/> 17/06/2010 and the Appellate Committee approved the<lb/> issuance of LOA on 13/07/2010. During the years 2009<lb/> to 2015, a number of other inspections were carried out at<lb/> the instance of Himachal Pradesh University and HP<lb/> Technical University but in every inspection several major<lb/> deficiencies were found in the said integrated complex in<lb/> respect of each discipline. All these deficiencies continue<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 338<lb/> to exist as observed by the SIT during its inspection in<lb/> January, 2016.<lb/> 7.<lb/> A surprise inspection was conducted on<lb/> 04/06/2012 by an Expert Visiting Committee at the<lb/> instance of CBI, CVO (Ministry of HRD) and CVC. In this<lb/> report, the Committee specifically reported that the<lb/> buildings was not ready for use, civil/electrical work not<lb/> completed, boundary walls not made, stock registers of<lb/> laboratory equipment, computers, system software<lb/> application software, printers etc, not presented, five<lb/> programmes running in the same campus, boys girls,<lb/> common rooms, cafeteria, stationary stores not as per<lb/> norms, class rooms, tutorial rooms, labs for UG/PG less in<lb/> numbers, incomplete and not as per norms, seminar hall<lb/> do not exist, no power connection in the laboratory, less<lb/> equipment, no boundary wall, no facility for handicapped,<lb/> no drinking water facility, no furniture available in<lb/> Engineering &amp; Technical and Management programme<lb/> level faculty<lb/> not shown, deficiency existed in<lb/> administrative areas and that the existing programmes<lb/> were running in a polytechnic college. This Committee did<lb/> not<lb/> recommend continuation of the existing courses<lb/> because all the buildings were under construction and<lb/> civil/electrical works incomplete. Based on the said report,<lb/> a Show Cause Notice was issued by AICTE on<lb/> 24/07/2012 as to why it should not be considered that<lb/> AICTE was misled by the Institute by giving<lb/> manipulated/false information, violation of terms and<lb/> conditions in the letter of approval and appropriate actions<lb/> including withdrawal of approval be not initiated against<lb/> the institution for nonobservance<lb/> of the terms and<lb/> conditions of approval as also for misleading the AICTE by<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 339<lb/> submitting false information. In response to the said Show<lb/> Cause Notice, K.C. Society submitted<lb/> a reply dated<lb/> 06/09/2012 wherein they claimed that the buildings were<lb/> complete in all respects.<lb/> 8.<lb/> The Society also submitted an application dated<lb/> 20/11/2009 to Director( Higher Education) HP for grant of<lb/> NOC for BBA, BCA and PGDCA programmes at K.C.<lb/> Institute of Management. Along with this application the<lb/> Society<lb/> submitted a certificate<lb/> dated 22/10/2009<lb/> purportedly issued by Sh. Sunil Mahajan of of M/s Sunil<lb/> Mahajan &amp; Associates, Architect, Chandigarh, certifying<lb/> that the building of K.C Institute of Management was<lb/> complete in all respects. Further, an affidavit dated<lb/> 17/11/2009 sworn by Sh. Prem Pal Gandhi, Chairman of<lb/> the Society to the effect that all the documents attached<lb/> with the NOC application for starting the said courses were<lb/> true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief<lb/> goes to prove his knowledge of submission of aforesaid<lb/> forged document. Sh. Sunil Mahajan denied to have issued<lb/> such a certificate.<lb/> 9.<lb/> The Society did not obtain No Objection Certificate<lb/> (NOC) from the Government of Himachal Pradesh which<lb/> was an essential requirement before affiliation from HPC<lb/> Shimla. It would be worthwhile to mention here that while<lb/> applying for affiliation with HPU it was misrepresented by<lb/> the institute that the concurrence of the State Government<lb/> had been obtained whereas only a copy of letter dated<lb/> 08/12/2008 issued by Director( Technical Education),<lb/> Sundernagr (HP) enclosing therewith an Essentiality<lb/> Certificate for the purchase of the land to start<lb/> Diplama/Degree level institutions at village &amp; P.O.<lb/> Pandoga Uparla, Tehsil &amp; District, Una was submitted by<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 340<lb/> the insitute to the HPU for the purpose of affiliation of the<lb/> integrated campus. It has come to light that K.C. Group of<lb/> Research and Professional Institute actually applied for<lb/> NOC on 07/03/2013 to Secretary (Technical Education) HP<lb/> and a NOC (expostfacto) to start Engineering and<lb/> Management Classes for the session 20092010 was<lb/> granted by Special Secretary (TE), Government of Himachal<lb/> Pradesh on 09/07/2013. Thus the Society started the<lb/> various institutions in 20092010 without the No Objection<lb/> Certificate from the State Government which was granted<lb/> expostfacto only on 09/07/2013.<lb/> 10.<lb/> On the basis of the various facts and evidence<lb/> available on record in the light of the different inspections<lb/> carried out by different committees appointed by different<lb/> agencies and SIT, it is established that K.C. Educational<lb/> and Social Welfare Society had misrepresented/mislead<lb/> and submitted false information/documents about the<lb/> completion of building as well as the fulfillment of other<lb/> norms laid down by the AICTE, HP TU, PCI and HP<lb/> Technical Education Board and various members of the<lb/> Committees connived with them and by abuse of their<lb/> official position as public servants submitted false<lb/> inspection reports to AICTE about the availability of all the<lb/> staff, equipment, machinery, furniture, books, journals,<lb/> accommodation, toilets, drinking water facility, boundary<lb/> wall, approach road and other essentialities as per the<lb/> norms laid down by the various agencies of Government of<lb/> India and Government of Himachal Pradesh and thus<lb/> cheated<lb/> them<lb/> in<lb/> the<lb/> matter<lb/> of<lb/> obtaining<lb/> approval/affiliation for running these institutions. Not only<lb/> this, even forged documents were submitted to obtain<lb/> approval from the Government of HP.<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 341<lb/> 449<lb/> On the basis of the aforesaid conclusions, it has<lb/> been prayed that<lb/> (i) a criminal case may please be ordered to be registered<lb/> either by the CBI or State Vigilance &amp; Anit Corruption<lb/> Bureau (HP) against the K.C. Educational and Social<lb/> Welfare Society, Pandoga Uparla, Una (HP) Sh. Prem Pal<lb/> Gandhi, Chairman of the Society, Dr. S.P.

Group of Institutions lacks basic<lb/> infrastructure to run Engineering, Management and<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 343<lb/> Pharmacy courses, no further admission may be ordered<lb/> to be allowed till all the deficiencies pointed out by the<lb/> inspecting committees and SIT from time to time for<lb/> various courses are rectified. It is, therefore, further<lb/> prayed that directions may kindly be issued to AICTE,<lb/> Pharmacy Council of India and the State of Himachal<lb/> Pradesh not to grant any further approval to K.C Group of<lb/> institutions<lb/> till<lb/> they<lb/> fulfill<lb/> the<lb/> minimum<lb/> requirements/norms laid down by them in this regard.</table>

            <table>r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 344<lb/> shortcoming in these institutions, therefore, they should be<lb/> permitted to continue.<lb/> 453<lb/> We find that there is yet another report regarding<lb/> institutions of management and technology at pages 59335937.<lb/> There is a supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the Assistant<lb/> Director, AICTE in compliance to the orders passed by this Court<lb/> on 4.7.2018, wherein it was averred that the inspection of the<lb/> institutes had been conducted after taking into account the<lb/> present condition and latest norms of the AICTE. To similar<lb/> effect<lb/> is an affidavit<lb/> in the case pertaining to the K.C.<lb/> Pharmaceutical Sciences (pages 59285938) and K.C. Group of<lb/> R&amp;PI Polytechnic (pages 59235927), however, it would be<lb/> necessary to refer to the latest supplementary affidavitcum<lb/> undertaking on behalf of the institution by Mr. Hitesh Gandhi,<lb/> wherein it is stated that the institution<lb/> has purchased 1577<lb/> books and along with that bills of such books have also been<lb/> attached. The institution has purchased library management<lb/> system software at the cost of Rs.35,000/, language lab<lb/> software amounting to Rs.36,000/, DVD writer, sound<lb/> speakers, USB headset with Mic and ejournals for each library<lb/> amounting to Rs.91,800/.

However,<lb/> one board had been displayed at the main entrance which<lb/> was old, rusted and not readable.<lb/> (n)<lb/> During inspection it was found that the applications<lb/> uploaded by Dev Bhumy Group of Institutions on AICTE<lb/> Portal seeking extension of approval for 20162017, the<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 348<lb/> facts regarding the number of faculty members and<lb/> Principals had falsely been shown as 149 against a<lb/> requirement for the Polytechnic. The physical verification<lb/> revealed that there were only 29 faculty members and a<lb/> combined Principal for Engineering College and<lb/> Polytechnic. Similar misrepresentations had also been<lb/> made in the past based on which extensions of approval<lb/> had been granted by ACITE as there had been no<lb/> inspection after the year 2010.<lb/> (0)<lb/> The inspection<lb/> also revealed that manipulated<lb/> figures, had been given in the applications uploaded on<lb/> AICTE Portal in respect of faculty members, builtup areas,<lb/> Library Books and Computers available<lb/> with the<lb/> institutions and extension approval was sought for the<lb/> Academic<lb/> Session<lb/> 20152016<lb/> based<lb/> on<lb/> these<lb/> misrepresentations.<lb/> (p)<lb/> False and misleading inspection reports were given<lb/> by the Expert Visiting Committee in as much as the<lb/> Committee which conducted the inspection of the institute<lb/> on 30/05/2010 found major shortcomings and therefore<lb/> the case for grant of approval was rejected by AICTE on<lb/> 30/07/2010 whereas another EVC which conducted<lb/> inspection on 18/8/2010 found no deficiencies based on<lb/> which approval was granted by AICTE. In fact, the<lb/> institutions did not have separate and sufficient<lb/> infrastructure, faculty and other requirements to run either<lb/> a Polytechnic or an Engineering College till date.<lb/> (q) It is rather strange that in the absence of any approval<lb/> from AICTE the Himachal Pradesh University permitted the<lb/> said Group of Institutions for Counseling to be conducted<lb/> by the Directorate of Technical Education, H.P.<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 349<lb/> (r) The extension of affiliation had been granted to the said<lb/> Group of Institutions from the Academic Session 2011<lb/> 2012 onwards by Himachal Pradesh Technical University<lb/> and every time after inspection the institution had<lb/> submitted false compliance reports regarding the<lb/> rectification of deficiencies pointed out by the inspection<lb/> team sent by HPTU.<lb/> (s) Over and above, Dev Bhumy Group of Institutions<lb/> started functioning without any &quot;No Objection Certificate&apos;<lb/> from the Government of Himachal Pradesh. They had very<lb/> cleverly circumvented the process by sending a letter to the<lb/> Chief Minister for NOC in the beginning which was not<lb/> found anywhere on record. During inspection they invoked<lb/> failing clause that since they did not receive any reply<lb/> from the State Government in this regard, the same<lb/> amounted to concurrence of the State Government.<lb/> (t)<lb/> During the<lb/> inspection it came to light that the<lb/> permission was granted by Revenue Department,<lb/> Government of H.P. to Dev Bhumy Educational Trust to<lb/> establish on Engineering College on 17/01/2009.<lb/> However, this facility was misused by the trust to run BBA<lb/> and BCA course also.<lb/> (u) The Principal Trustee of the trust ( Sh. Bhupinder<lb/> Kumar Sharma) and the main Author of the Trust ( Smt.<lb/> Neelam Kumari Sharma) are husband &amp; wife and both are<lb/> Canadian Citizens since 2000 and therefore unable to<lb/> supervise the activities of the institutions. This fact had not<lb/> been disclose to any of the authorities by the Trust till<lb/> date. The receipt of funds from the said two persons by the<lb/> Trust was also in violation of the Foreign Contribution<lb/> (Regulation) Act 1976.<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 350<lb/> 456<lb/> Based upon aforesaid conclusions, it was prayed as<lb/> under:<lb/> A criminal case may please be ordered to be registered<lb/> either CBI or State Vigilance &amp; Anit Corruption Bureau,<lb/> Himachal Pradesh against Sh.

Since the Dev Bhumy Group of Institutions lacks<lb/> basic infrastructure to run Engineering and Diploma<lb/> Courses, no further admission may be ordered to be<lb/> allowed till all the deficiencies pointed out by the<lb/> inspecting committees and SIT from time to time for<lb/> various courses were rectified. It is therefore, further<lb/> prayed that directions may please be given to AICTE New<lb/> Delhi, HP Technical University, Hamirpur and Himachal<lb/> Pradesh Takniki Shiksha Board, Dharamshala not to<lb/> grant any further extesnion of approval/extension of<lb/> affiliation to Dev Bhumy Polytechnic till they they fulfill the<lb/> minimum requirement/norms laid down by AICTE in<lb/> respect of infrastructure, faculty labs, workshop, library<lb/> and other commons facilities.<lb/> 457<lb/> The Institution was inspected by the VT of the<lb/> AICTE pursuant to the order passed by this Court and in its<lb/> report (pages 26942721), it has been pointed out that the<lb/> institution has applied for progressive closure vide application<lb/> I.D.: 111234567 from the academic year 201819, but the<lb/> deficiencies were observed in numbers and areas in laboratories,<lb/> class rooms, tutorials, some amenities/facilities. These areas<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 352<lb/> have been shared within campus of Dev Bhoomi Polytechnic.<lb/> Some deficiencies were also observed in faculty and supporting<lb/> staff. The Polytechnic Institute was also inspected by the VT of<lb/> AICTE and in its report (pages 28882909), no significant<lb/> deficiencies were noticed, however it was observed that some<lb/> administrative and academic infrastructural facilities are shared<lb/> with existing Dev Bhoomi Institute of Engineering and<lb/> Technology.<lb/> 458<lb/> The Institution has controverted the reports of the<lb/> SIT and VT initially by filing a response (pages 14041441),<lb/> however,<lb/> it<lb/> would<lb/> be<lb/> necessary<lb/> to<lb/> refer<lb/> to<lb/> an<lb/> affidavit/undertaking (pages 59435952) filed by the Institution,<lb/> wherein it is stated that the decision for closure of B.Tech.<lb/> Courses has already been taken and there would be no new<lb/> admission in any B.Tech. Course for academic session 201819.<lb/> Only the existing students would be permitted to complete the<lb/> courses and shall be transferred to other B.Tech.

Therefore, all the infrastructure and the facilities<lb/> that were being utilized by the institution earlier shall be<lb/> available and put to use for polytechnic college.<lb/> 459<lb/> In light of the affidavit filed by the Institution, the<lb/> AICTE was directed to inspect the college afresh and in<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> . P .<lb/> 353<lb/> compliance to the order so passed by this Court had placed on<lb/> record EVC report (pages 67166744), wherein it is confirmed<lb/> that the Institution has applied for closure. Therefore, we have<lb/> no doubt in our mind that the infrastructure that was earlier<lb/> being utilized by B.Tech. courses would now be sufficient to run<lb/> polytechnic courses, therefore, the Institute is permitted to run<lb/> polytechnic courses.<lb/> Db)4<lb/> MIT College of Engineering &amp; Management, Bani,<lb/> Ganoh Rajputan, Barsar, Hamirpur, H.P.<lb/> 460<lb/> The SIT in its progress report No.6 (pages 4753)<lb/> has not really found any serious infrastructural deficiencies,<lb/> however, it was solely prayed that a criminal case may be<lb/> ordered to be registered either by CBI or State Vigilance &amp; Anti<lb/> Corruption Bureau, Himachal Pradesh against Shri Vinod<lb/> Thakur, President of Kailash Education SocietycumPrincipal,<lb/> MIT Polytechnic and unknown others for obtaining extension of<lb/> approval from AICTE on the basis of misrepresentation/false<lb/> information regarding infrastructural facilities available with the<lb/> polytechnic institution.

There is one more report available at pages<lb/> 66676715, wherein it is pointed out that the Chairman of the<lb/> Institution has given an undertaking that MIT Polytechnic has<lb/> been closed from the session 201617. At present, no student is<lb/> studying in MIT Polytechnic and all its resources including<lb/> building, computers, laboratory equipments and books in the<lb/> library are being utilized by MIT College of Engineering and<lb/> Management (MIT CEM).

It is further averred that for polytechnic courses,<lb/> 5 acres of land is required and for pharmacy courses, 2 acres<lb/> of land is required, whereas the Society is in fact having 7.1<lb/> acres of land. As regards requirement of more computer<lb/> systems, it is averred that the society is having an approved<lb/> intake of 270 seats only in different streams for the current<lb/> academic session 201819. As against 270 seats, the total<lb/> number of admissions in Polytechnic Institute is only 24<lb/> students. Till last year, total number of students were 154<lb/> in all three classes.

However, after the<lb/> recognition was granted by the AICTE on the<lb/> recommendations of the SLC, Shri Shakti Chand<lb/> transferred the land in the name of his mother who further<lb/> sold it off to different parties. Further, an expert committee<lb/> of Directorate of Technical Education, Sunder Nagar,<lb/> misrepresented the facts in their inspection report dated<lb/> 12.5.2005 to the effect that the society has adequate land<lb/> available. The institute badly lacks in infrastructure. In<lb/> view of the aforesaid facts, it can be concluded that the<lb/> society committee a fraud and misrepresented to the<lb/> AICTE/DTE regarding<lb/> availability of land and thus<lb/> dishonestly and fraudulently obtained recognition by<lb/> cheating DTE/AICTE.<lb/> 486<lb/> On the basis of the aforesaid conclusions, it has<lb/> been prayed that:<lb/> H<lb/> i g h<lb/> C<lb/> o u r t o f H<lb/> .
