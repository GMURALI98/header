			<p>1.<lb/> The petitioner has filed the above mentioned petition under<lb/> Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter<lb/> referred to as the &apos;Act&apos;) for appointment of an Arbitrator for<lb/> adjudication of the disputes having arisen between the parties.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> The petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies<lb/> Act, 1956 and is engaged in the business of providing services for<lb/> Building, Upgrading, Consolidation and support of the<lb/> telecommunication infrastructure. As per the petitioner, the value of<lb/> the claim(s) is to the tune of Rs.91 crores.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> The respondent is a registered infrastructure provider,<lb/> Category-1 (IP-1) by virtue of registration granted by the Department<lb/> of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communication &amp; IT, Government<lb/> of India and is engaged in the business of the establishment,<lb/> maintenance and provision of passive telecommunication<lb/> infrastructure doing the business in the name and style of &apos;Indus<lb/> Towers Limited&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> The petitioner and the respondent entered into an agreement<lb/> dated 6 th October 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the said<lb/> agreement) whereby subject to the terms and conditions of the said<lb/> agreement, the respondent engaged the petitioner for providing the<lb/> service as per Annexure-II of that agreement.<lb/></p>

			<head>The case of the petitioner as per the petition<lb/></head>

			<p>5.<lb/> As per the said agreement, the petitioner had to provide the<lb/> services in 5 Telecom circles i.e. Maharashtra, U. P. (E), U. P. (W),<lb/> Rajasthan and Gujarat as per the terms and conditions mentioned in<lb/> the said agreement. The respondent had to give to the petitioner the<lb/> work for each circle as detailed in Annexure-I of the said agreement<lb/> which is detailed below:<lb/> ANNEXURE-I<lb/> SERVICE AREA<lb/> Service area within which the service provider shall render its<lb/> service, pursuant to this Agreement, comprises of the following:<lb/> Sr.<lb/> No.<lb/> Circles<lb/> Starting October<lb/> Starting November<lb/> Starting December<lb/> New<lb/> Build<lb/> Upgrade New<lb/> Build<lb/> Upgrade New Build<lb/> Upgrade<lb/></p>

			<p>5.1. As per the Annexure-I of the said agreement, the respondent<lb/> had to give the petitioner 25 New Build Work and 100 upgrade work<lb/> in each circle every month as per Annexure-I of the said agreement.<lb/> For that purpose the respondent had also instructed the<lb/> petitioner to recruit the employees/manpower as per the standards<lb/> mentioned by the respondent in Annexure-V which is attached with<lb/> the agreement. Clause 6(i) of the agreement deals with Manpower<lb/> Recruitment Details and standards:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;In order to fulfill its obligations under this agreement, my<lb/> client shall deploy manpower in the manner and of the<lb/> standard as agreed and set out in Annexure-V titled<lb/> &apos;manpower Recruitment Details and Standard&apos; to this<lb/> agreement.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>5.2 As mentioned above and as per the respondent&apos;s instructions<lb/> and standard mentioned in Annexure-V in which the respondent had<lb/> given the list for recruitment of manpower for 25 new Build sites and<lb/> 100 Upgrade sites, the petitioner had recruited the required number of<lb/> employees as detailed below:<lb/> and it is alleged that as per the instruction and assurance of the<lb/> respondent to give average monthly 25 New Sites and 100 upgrade<lb/> sites, the petitioner had recruited the employees as per the<lb/> respondent&apos;s requirement as detailed, standards and qualification<lb/> mentioned in Annexure-V.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.3 The said agreement dated 6 th October, 2008 was for the period<lb/> of 3 years (36 months) i.e. from 6 th October, 2008 to 5 th October,<lb/> 2011. It is alleged by the petitioner that during the aforesaid period<lb/> the respondent had to give the petitioner the work for each circle as<lb/> detailed in Annexure-I of the said agreement. The respondent had<lb/> assured the petitioner to give in each circle (Maharashtra, U.P.(E),<lb/> U.P(W), Rajasthan and Gujarat) average monthly 25 New Build Work<lb/> and 100 upgraded Work. As per the said agreement, the respondent<lb/> had to give the petitioner in 36 months in all 5 circles 4500 New Build<lb/> Works [25 (work) X 36 (Months) X 5 (circles)]. In the same way and<lb/> as per the said agreement in 36 months the respondent had to give<lb/> the petitioner in all 5 circles 18000 Upgraded Works [100 (work) X 36<lb/> (Months) X 5 (Circles)].<lb/></p>

			<p>5.4 The respondent had to give the petitioner the work as stated<lb/> aforesaid in terms of the Annexure-I of the said agreement. However,<lb/> the respondent failed to allot the contracted work to the petitioner,<lb/> rather in terms of the said agreement, the respondent had to give the<lb/> said work in 36 months and the petitioner had to fulfill all the<lb/> requirements as per the said agreement, although the petitioner had<lb/> fulfilled all its contractual requirements/ obligations as per the terms<lb/> and condition of the said agreement.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.5 It is submitted that the petitioner also had to recruit all the<lb/> manpower/employees mentioned in Annexure-V to the said<lb/> agreement as the respondent had assured the petitioner to give<lb/> average monthly 25 New Site and 100 upgrade sites. There has<lb/> never been even an iota of objection or complaint on behalf of the<lb/> respondent in respect of the performance of the obligations on the<lb/> part of the petitioner under the said agreement.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> The petitioner submits that as per the Annexure-I to said<lb/> agreement, the respondent had to allot the work to the petitioner<lb/> which was agreed that the respondent can change/modify/reduce the<lb/> work but by providing a written notice to the service provider/<lb/> petitioner and the service provider would be bound by the same.<lb/> However, the respondent never gave any such notice to the petitioner<lb/> who had performed all its obligations as per the terms and<lb/> condition of the said agreement and the respondent was completely<lb/> satisfied with their work which was also mentioned in their<lb/> emails.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> The petitioner alleges that in spite of this, the petitioner<lb/> understands that the respondent had given its work to some other<lb/> companies in the same circle allotted to the petitioner in the breach of<lb/> the said agreement causing huge losses in turn to the petitioner. But,<lb/> the respondent has failed to fulfill its obligations and to comply with<lb/> the terms and conditions of the said agreement.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> The petitioner submits that in terms of the said agreement the<lb/> respondent had to allot/give the petitioner below mentioned work in<lb/> 36 months :-<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> The petitioner also submits that there is a difference between<lb/> the actual works which the respondent had to allot/give to the<lb/> petitioner. The difference of work which the respondent had not given<lb/> to the petitioner in each circle are as under:<lb/> Arb.P. 455/2015<lb/> Arb.P. 455/2015<lb/></p>

			<p>10. In view of the above, it is submitted by the petitioner that from<lb/> the respondent&apos;s side there is a breach of obligations and non-<lb/>fulfillment of the terms and condition of the said agreement. The<lb/> respondent had failed to allot/give the wok as per the said agreement.<lb/> In fact the respondent had given 534 New Build Work and 1842<lb/> Upgraded work. The respondent had not given 3966 New Build Work<lb/> and 16158 Upgraded Work as specified in the said agreement and<lb/> which the respondent was liable to give to the petitioner despite of<lb/> sending many emails to the respondent for giving/allotting further<lb/> work to them as per the terms and condition of the said agreement<lb/> but the respondent failed to allot the work as per its commitment in<lb/> the agreement. The respondent failed to abide by the terms and<lb/> conditions of the said agreement and had failed to fulfill its<lb/> commitments as per the said agreement.<lb/></p>

			<head>The case set up by the respondent<lb/></head>

			<p>11. The prayer of the petitioner is opposed by the respondent who<lb/> stated that it has not received the purported notice of invocation dated<lb/> 20 th September, 2012 or purported letters dated 15 th February, 2014<lb/> and 20 th March, 2014 filed by the petitioner before this Court<lb/> alongwith petition. The respondent submits that the petitioner has with<lb/> malafide intention addressed all the three purported notices and<lb/> letters mentioned in the preceding paragraph on respondent&apos;s old<lb/> address to ensure that the respondent is not in receipt of the same<lb/> and hence, not in a position to respond to them.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. It is also alleged by the respondent that the petitioner has infact<lb/> as far back as on 30 th December, 2008 wrote a letter to the<lb/> respondent on the correct/new address. Such an act on petitioner&apos;s<lb/> behalf can only be attributed to its ill-conceived agenda to harass the<lb/> respondent and extract monetary gains.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. It is argued on behalf of the respondent that the invocation is<lb/> bad and contrary to the arbitration clause as per the averments made<lb/> by the petitioner itself in para 26 and 29 of the petition.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. It is submitted that the legal notice dated 20 th September, 2012<lb/> and letters dated 15 th February, 2014 and 20 th March, 2014 would<lb/> establish that the contentions of the petitioner are misleading, false<lb/> and are untenable legally and contractually.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. In nutshell, it is submitted that even the notice (which was not<lb/> received by the respondent) did not meet the mandatory requirements<lb/> stipulated under Section 21, Section 11 (3) and Section 11 (5) of the<lb/> Act. In order to invoke any reference to arbitration, the petitioner<lb/> ought to have invoked arbitration in terms of Section 21 of the Act,<lb/> requesting the respondent for the purported dispute to be referred to<lb/> arbitration, but it can even be remotely inferred from the purported<lb/> legal notice dated 20 th September, 2012 that it contained any request<lb/> for reference of purported disputes to arbitration much less as alleged<lb/> by the petitioner in paragraph Nos. 26 and 29 of the petition.<lb/> In support of the above, it is submitted that the Arbitration<lb/> Agreement provides procedure for appointment of Arbitrator which is<lb/> not complied by the petitioner on the face of record.<lb/></p>

			<p>16. It is argued by Mr.Gopal Jain learned Senior counsel appearing<lb/> on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner failed to follow the<lb/> procedure prescribed under Section 11 (3) or Section 11 (5) of the<lb/> Act. The petitioner in contrary to the statutory provisions, unilaterally<lb/> appointed Ms. Praveena Gautam, Advocate as a sole Arbitrator. As<lb/> the petitioner has not invoked arbitration as per the statutory<lb/> requirements of the Act, thus, this Court should not grant the prayer<lb/> as sought in the absence of compliance of procedure agreed by both<lb/> the parties in written agreement. It is submitted that assuming the<lb/> purported appointment of Ms. Praveena Gautam as a sole Arbitrator<lb/> was valid, the petition seeking appointment of an independent<lb/> Arbitrator lacks cause of action since it is not the case of the petitioner<lb/> that Ms. Praveena Gautam has declined to act or expressed her<lb/> inability to proceed with the arbitration.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. Mr.Gopal Jain, learned Senior counsel, has also argued that the<lb/> petitioner has not served the notice at the correct address despite of<lb/> having the full knowledge about the change of address as the<lb/> petitioner itself has earlier corresponded with the respondent at new<lb/> address. He says that in the present case, the petitioner has acted<lb/> malafidely; all the acts and conducts of the petitioner are contrary to<lb/> the arbitration clause, therefore unless the proper procedure is<lb/> followed, his client is not ready to give its consent to the prayer made<lb/> in the present petition.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. Counsel for the petitioner on the other hand argued that the<lb/> respondent did receive the notice. It was sent by registered post.<lb/> There is a presumption under Sections 3 and 4 of the Act, therefore,<lb/> the said objection is wholly misconceived. As far as compliance of<lb/> arbitration clause is concerned, he says that after filing the present<lb/> petition, the matter was referred to the mediation centre, thus, the first<lb/> condition is also satisfied. With regard to other objection about the<lb/> appointment of Advocate as Arbitrator without the consent of<lb/> respondent, he says that his client is now agreeable if retired Judge of<lb/> this Court is appointed as sole Arbitrator who would adjudicate the<lb/> disputes between the parties in view of existing arbitration clause.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. Mr.Gopal Jain, learned Senior counsel, has refuted his<lb/> arguments and submits that no doubt the matter was referred for<lb/> mediation but the same was referred by the Court without prejudice.<lb/> He says that all the claims of the petitioner are bogus and time<lb/> barred. The same are raised in order to blackmail his client,<lb/> therefore, in the nature of the present matter, the Court should strictly<lb/> examine the provisions of the Act and law applicable.<lb/></p>

			<p>20. Let me now deal with rival submissions of the parties.<lb/></p>

			<p>21. As per the petitioner the following disputes have arisen between<lb/> the parties out of the said agreement which are required to be<lb/> adjudicated by the Arbitrator in terms of the agreement:-<lb/></p>

			<item>i)<lb/> Damages/losses caused to the petitioner by not<lb/> giving/allotting the work as per the terms and condition of<lb/> the said agreement to the tune of Rs.77,00,00,000/-,<lb/></item>

			<item>ii)<lb/></item>

			<item>Man power expenses which the petitioner had incurred to<lb/> the tune of Rs. 8,00,00,000/-,<lb/></item>

			<item>iii)<lb/> Office expenses which the petitioner had incurred to the<lb/> tune of Rs. 1,00,00,000/-approx.,<lb/></item>

			<item>iv)<lb/> impairment cause to the petitioner&apos;s goodwill to the tune of<lb/> Rs. 5,00,00,000/-and<lb/> v)<lb/> with interest @ 24% per annum from expiry of the<lb/> agreement till the date of actual payment and costs.<lb/></item>

			<p>22. The arbitration clause has been reproduced herein below:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Clause 7(xix). Arbitration -In the event of any dispute,<lb/> differences or claims arising between the parties in<lb/> connection with this Agreement, during the subsistence<lb/> or land after its termination in any manner whatsoever<lb/> including the validity or the construction or interpolation of<lb/> any of the clauses hereof or anything done or omitted to<lb/> be done pursuant hereto, the parties shall first endeavor<lb/> to amicably settle such disputes, differences or claims,<lb/> failing with the same shall be referred and resolved<lb/> through Arbitration in accordance with the provisions of<lb/> the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or any<lb/> reenactment or modification thereof ..... &quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>23. The relevant excerpts from the purported legal notice dated 20 th<lb/> September, 2012 have been reproduced herein below:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;30. Take notice that on any failure on your part to<lb/> comply with this demand notice within the stipulate<lb/> time, my client would be constrained, without any<lb/> further reference/notice to your client to refer the<lb/> matter to Arbitration by the Sole Arbitrator appointed<lb/> by my client, as per the relevant arbitral Clause as<lb/> contained in the said Agreement enter between your client<lb/> and my client under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,<lb/> 1996.&quot;<lb/> (Emphasis Supplied)<lb/></p>

			<p>The case of the respondent is that the petitioner in the purported<lb/> letter dated 20 th September, 2012, has neither mentioned about<lb/> appointment of Ms. Praveena Gautam as the Sole Arbitrator nor has<lb/> the petitioner called upon the respondent to either agree or to appoint<lb/> their Arbitrator, as alleged or otherwise.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. The relevant excerpts of paragraph Nos. 26 and 29 of the<lb/> petition are reproduced herein below:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;26. ...It was requisitioned in the said notice that on any<lb/> failure of the Respondent to comply with this demand notice<lb/> within the stipulated time, the Petitioner would be<lb/> constrained, without any further reference/ notice to the<lb/> Respondent, to refer the matter for adjudication of the<lb/> disputes to Arbitration by the Sole Arbitrator (Ms.<lb/> Praveena Gautam, Advocate on record, Supreme Court<lb/> of India) appointed by the Petitioner. The Petitioner<lb/> also called upon the Respondent to either to agree on<lb/> appointment of the Arbitrator named by the petitioner<lb/> or to appoint their Arbitrator as per the relevant arbitral<lb/> clause as contained in the said Agreement entered<lb/> between the Respondent and the Petitioner and under the<lb/> Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ...&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>29.<lb/> The Petitioner submits that it has served 30 days<lb/> notice on 20.09.2012 to both the Respondent and<lb/> proposed the name of the Arbitrator namely, Ms;<lb/> Praveena Gautam, Advocate on Record, Supreme<lb/> Court of India. The Respondent has not come forward for<lb/> any claim for appointment of Arbitrator and the Petitioner<lb/> invoked the Section 11 with sub-section 4 &amp; 5 of the<lb/> Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996.&quot; (Emphasis supplied)<lb/></p>

			<p>25. In the present case, the respondent has challenged the<lb/> maintainability of the present petition firstly, on the ground of non-<lb/>receipt of notice which is required under Section 11 of the Act. It is<lb/> argued that it was not delivered or served at the correct address. As<lb/> per the provisions of the Act, if the notice is sent at the correct<lb/> address, no doubt inference can be drawn that it is a deemed service,<lb/> but the position in the present case is different as the notice was sent<lb/> at the old address where the respondent did not exist. Counsel for<lb/> the respondent has pointed out that the petitioner was aware about<lb/> the new address but it has chosen to send the notice at old address.<lb/> He says that it is intentionally done in order to appoint its own<lb/> Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes. The said act is contrary to the<lb/> scheme of the Act as well as it offends the arbitration clause.<lb/> Counsel has also pointed out the clause of the agreement wherein it<lb/> was agreed by the parties that in case of change of address, the<lb/> correspondence is to take place at the new address. No Regd. AD<lb/> card has been placed on record by the petitioner. Only photocopy of<lb/> postal receipt is filed. From the record, it appears that the notice was<lb/> not sent at the new address. Thus, the Court is not inclined to give<lb/> the benefit of service by concluding that the proper notice has been<lb/> served and delivered at the correct address of the respondent.<lb/></p>

			<p>26. Even otherwise, before coming to any conclusion, let me take<lb/> up the next objection of the respondent that the procedure has not<lb/> been followed by the petitioner at the time of invoking the arbitration,<lb/> the answer of the petitioner is that since after filing the petition the<lb/> matter was referred to mediation, it indicated that the parties were<lb/> ready to settle their disputes. As the disputes were not settled, now<lb/> the matter is to be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal. The said<lb/> compliance under these circumstances is made out.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. I do not agree with the arguments of the petitioner&apos;s counsel<lb/> because of the reason as the reference date is the date of invocation.<lb/> In case all the requirements on the date of invocation are not<lb/> satisfied, the court may not allow the prayer unless with the consent<lb/> of both the parties. In the present case as per the arbitration clause,<lb/> it was required by the parties that they shall first endeavor to amicably<lb/> settle such dispute, differences or claims, failing which the disputes<lb/> would be referred for thorough arbitration.<lb/> Nothing is available on record to show that prior to invocation,<lb/> the plaintiff has at any time communicated or had a meeting with the<lb/> respondent for amicable settlement. No notice of such nature was<lb/> sent, rather the notice was allegedly sent on 20 th September, 2012<lb/> wherein it was also mentioned that in case the amount is not paid, the<lb/> petitioner would take criminal and civil action against the respondent.<lb/> After filing the petition, if the matter was referred to the mediation<lb/> centre &apos;without prejudice, it is not a compliance of the procedure.<lb/></p>

			<p>28. The petitioner in the present case, without following the<lb/> procedure (laid down in the arbitration clause) has appointed the sole<lb/> Arbitrator without the consent of the respondent. The said act of the<lb/> petitioner is one sided which is against the scheme of the Act and<lb/> agreed procedure mentioned in the agreement.<lb/></p>

			<p>29. In Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd., (2000) 8 SCC<lb/> 151, the question which arose for consideration was whether there<lb/> was a failure of the mechanism provided in the arbitration clause of<lb/> the agreement whereunder disputes were to be referred to an<lb/> arbitrator to be nominated by the lessor. The lessor gave notice to the<lb/> lessee and later appointed an arbitrator. It is in this context that the<lb/> Supreme Court held as under:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;...When parties have entered into a contract and settled<lb/> on a procedure, due importance has to be given to such<lb/> procedure. Even though rigor of the doctrine of &quot;freedom<lb/> of contract&quot; has been whittled down by various labour<lb/> and social welfare legislation, still the court has to<lb/> respect the terms of the contract entered into by parties<lb/> and endeavour to give importance and effect to it. When<lb/> the party has not disputed the arbitration clause,<lb/> normally he is bound by it and obliged to comply with<lb/> the procedure laid down under the said clause....&quot;<lb/> (emphasis supplied)<lb/></p>

			<p>30. In the present case, the procedure prescribed, and mutually<lb/> agreed to by the parties, under the arbitration agreement, the said<lb/> procedure must be strictly adhered to and non-compliance thereof<lb/> must, as of course, result in dismissal of the application. Section<lb/> 11(5) are judicial in nature. If the parties fail to agree on an Arbitrator<lb/> within thirty days from receipt of a request by one party from the other<lb/> to so agree, would the Chief Justice&apos;s designate have jurisdiction,<lb/> under Section 11(5) of the Act, to appoint an Arbitrator. Failure to<lb/> agree on an Arbitrator would only arise if the party after the receipt of<lb/> notice did not take any step before filing of the petition under Section<lb/> 11 before the Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. In SBP &amp; Co. vs. Patel Engineering Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618,<lb/> the Supreme Court observed:<lb/> ...It is fundamental to our procedural jurisprudence, that<lb/> the right of no person shall be affected without he being<lb/> heard. This necessarily imposes an obligation on the<lb/> Chief Justice to issue notice to the opposite party when<lb/> he is moved under Section 11 of the Act. The notice to<lb/> the opposite party cannot be considered to be merely an<lb/> intimation to that party of the filing of the arbitration<lb/> application and the passing of an order appointing an<lb/> arbitrator or an Arbitral Tribunal. It is really the giving of<lb/> an opportunity of being heard.<lb/></p>

			<p>32. In the present case, the requirement of making a request in<lb/> writing to the respondent seeking his consent for the appointment of<lb/> an Arbitrator, and waiting for a period of thirty days, before filing the<lb/> application under Section 11(5) of the Act, has not been complied<lb/> with. Further, the petitioner has also failed to follow the procedure<lb/> laid down in the arbitration clause of amicable settlement. This Court<lb/> is clear in its mind that if injustice is being done to the petitioner on<lb/> the face of the record, then the procedure to some extent cannot be<lb/> relaxed in order to avoid delay. However, if prima facie Court finds in<lb/> second category of cases that the claims raised by a party in the<lb/> petition under Section 11 of the Act are apparently fanciful or self<lb/> created, then under these circumstances, the Court has to follow the<lb/> procedure stringently and due process of procedure is to be adhered<lb/> to. The present case does not come within the category of first<lb/> exception. Therefore, the petition is dismissed for want of full<lb/> compliance as per arbitration clause.<lb/></p>

			<p>33. It is open to the petitioner to comply with the aforesaid<lb/> requirements and proceed thereafter in accordance with law and file<lb/> the fresh petition after following the procedure, if so advised. If any<lb/> petition is filed, the same would be decided as per its own merit.<lb/></p>
