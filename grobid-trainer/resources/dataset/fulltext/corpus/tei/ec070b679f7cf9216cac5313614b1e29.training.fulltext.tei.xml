			<lb />
			Service Tax Department issued a notice to the
			<lb />
			petitioners under the amended Finance Act in 2007 requiring
			<lb />
			the petitioners to register under the said Act for payment of
			<lb />
			service tax. Disputing the liability, W.P. (C) No.19 of 2007,
			<lb />
			titled Martin Lottery Agencies Ltd. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.
			<lb />
			came to be filed before this Court challenging the levy of
			<lb />
			service tax upon the sale of lottery tickets. This petition was
			<lb />
			allowed by this Hon&apos;ble Court vide Judgment dated
			<lb />
			18.09.2007 declaring that no service tax was payable on the
			<lb />
			activity undertaken by the petitioner.
			<lb />
			The relevant
			<lb />
			observations are quoted hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;………………………… The arguments this time centered out
			<lb />
			whether lottery tickets are goods or not. The statutory
			<lb />
			provisions which are material in this regard are extracted in
			<lb />
			my earlier order. On the authority of the Constitution Bench
			<lb />
			of the Supreme Court which delivered its judgment in the
			<lb />
			Sunrise Associates case (2006) 5 SCC 603 lottery tickets
			<lb />
			have to be held to be actionable claims. As such those would
			<lb />
			not be goods within the meaning of the definition clause in
			<lb />
			the Sale of Goods Act. If the lottery tickets are not goods,
			<lb />
			the writ petitioners cannot said to be rendering any service
			<lb />
			in relation to the promotion of their client&apos;s goods, or
			<lb />
			marketing of their client&apos;s goods, or sale of their client&apos;s
			<lb />
			goods.&quot;
			<lb />
			The aforesaid judgment came to be challenged before the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.3239 of 2009.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			During the pendency of this Civil Appeal, the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 1994 was further amended with the
			<lb />
			introduction of an &quot;Explanation&quot; to Section 65(19)(ii) of the
			<lb />
			Finance Act. The Explanation is reproduced hereunder: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Explanation.-For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
			<lb />
			declared that for the purposes of this sub-clause, &quot;service in
			<lb />
			relation to promotion or marketing of service provided by the
			<lb />
			client: includes any service provided in relation to promotion
			<lb />
			or marketing of games of chance, organized, conducted or
			<lb />
			promoted by the client, in whatever form or by whatever
			<lb />
			name called, whether or not conducted online, including
			<lb />
			lottery, lotto, bingo; [Explanation inserted vide Finance Act,
			<lb />
			2008 w.e.f. 16 th May, 2008]&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court was apprised of the
			<lb />
			aforesaid amendment. Taking note of the Explanation and
			<lb />
			its impact on the judgment delivered by this Court, the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held the Explanation to be a
			<lb />
			substantive law and declared it to be prospective.
			<lb />
			Regarding the validity of the Explanation, the issue was left
			<lb />
			open.
			<lb />
			However, the judgment of this Court was not
			<lb />
			interfered.
			<lb />
			The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court delivered its
			<lb />
			judgment on 05.05.2009 reported in 2009(14) S.T.R. 503
			<lb />
			(SC) : (2009) 12 SCC 209, titled Union of India &amp; Ors.
			<lb />
			v. Martin Lottery Agencies Ltd.
			<lb />
			The relevant
			<lb />
			observations of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in this regard are
			<lb />
			quoted hereunder: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;
			<lb />
			36. It is, therefore, evident that by reason of an
			<lb />
			explanation, a substantive law may also be introduced. If a
			<lb />
			substantive law is introduced, it will have no retrospective
			<lb />
			effect.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The notice issued to the assessee by the appellant
			<lb />
			has, thus, rightly been held to be liable to be set aside.
			<lb />
			Subject to the constitutionality of the Act, in view of the
			<lb />
			explanation appended to this, we are of the opinion that the
			<lb />
			service tax, if any, would be payable only with effect from
			<lb />
			May, 2008 and not with retrospective effect.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			37. In a case of this nature, the Court must be
			<lb />
			satisfied that the Parliament did not intend to introduce a
			<lb />
			substantive change in the law. As stated hereinbefore, for
			<lb />
			the aforementioned purpose, the expressions like &apos;for the
			<lb />
			removal of doubts&apos; are not conclusive. The said expressions
			<lb />
			appear to have been used under assumption that organizing
			<lb />
			games of chance would be rendition of service. We are
			<lb />
			herein not concerned as to whether it was constitutionally
			<lb />
			permissible for the Parliament to do so as we are not called
			<lb />
			upon to determine the said question but for our purpose, it
			<lb />
			would be suffice to hold that the explanation is not
			<lb />
			clarificatory or declaratory in nature.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			38. For the views we have taken, we have no other
			<lb />
			option but to hold that the High Court judgment albeit for
			<lb />
			different reasons warrants no interference. This appeal is
			<lb />
			dismissed
			<lb />
			with costs.
			<lb />
			Counsel fee assessed at
			<lb />
			Rs.1,00,000/-.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			In view of the observations of the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, the petitioner filed Writ Petition (C) No.36 of
			<lb />
			2009 challenging the validity of the Explanation to Section
			<lb />
			65 (19)(ii) of the Finance Act, 1994, titled M/s. Future
			<lb />
			Gaming Solutions Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. This
			<lb />
			Writ Petition was dismissed by this Court vide its judgment
			<lb />
			dated 30.07.2010.
			<lb />
			Aggrieved by the dismissal of this
			<lb />
			petition, the petitioner filed a Special Leave Petition before
			<lb />
			the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, being SLP (C) No.26771 of
			<lb />
			2010, wherein Union of India has been put on notice and
			<lb />
			petition is pending consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			While the aforesaid issue is pending consideration
			<lb />
			before the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, the Finance Act, 1994
			<lb />
			again came to be amended with the deletion of the
			<lb />
			Explanation to Section 65(19)(ii) and introduction of a new
			<lb />
			category of &quot;taxable service&quot; vide clause (zzzzn) to Sub-
			<lb />
			section (105) of Section 65 vide the Finance Act of 2010
			<lb />
			with effect from 01.07.2010. The relevant amendment thus
			<lb />
			introduced reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(105)
			<lb />
			&quot;taxable service&quot; means any service provided
			<lb />
			or to be provided,-
			<lb />
			…
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(zzzzn)
			<lb />
			to any person, by any other person, for
			<lb />
			promotion, marketing, organising or in any other manner
			<lb />
			assisting in organizing games of chance, including lottery,
			<lb />
			Bingo or Lotto in whatever form or by whatever name called,
			<lb />
			whether or not conducted through internet or other
			<lb />
			electronic networks;&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			The petitioners got themselves registered under
			<lb />
			the provision of the amended Act. It is alleged that this
			<lb />
			registration is under mistaken fact and they are paying
			<lb />
			service tax since then under protest. It is further alleged
			<lb />
			that now the petitioners have realised that no service tax is
			<lb />
			payable on the activity undertaken by them in terms of the
			<lb />
			amended clause (zzzzn) to Section 65(105) of the Finance
			<lb />
			Act, 1994 and have challenged the same in these petitions
			<lb />
			before us.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10.
			<lb />
			Challenge to the amended Clause (zzzzn) to Sub-
			<lb />
			section (105) to Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 is
			<lb />
			primarily on the following two grounds -
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			(A) that the activity being performed by the
			<lb />
			petitioners does not fall within the purview of
			<lb />
			&quot;Taxable Service&quot;, the transaction between
			<lb />
			the petitioners and the State of Sikkim
			<lb />
			simpliciter being a purchase and sale of
			<lb />
			lottery tickets or at the best an actionable
			<lb />
			claim; and
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(B) the conduct of lottery is an act of &quot;betting
			<lb />
			and gambling&quot;, the same being a game of
			<lb />
			chance, the State Legislature under entry 62
			<lb />
			of List II of Schedule 7 to the Constitution of
			<lb />
			India has exclusive competence to enact law
			<lb />
			to impose taxes. The Parliament under its
			<lb />
			residuary legislative power under entry 97 of
			<lb />
			List I, Schedule 7 to the Constitution of India
			<lb />
			lacks legislative competence to levy any tax
			<lb />
			in respect to the activity falling under entries
			<lb />
			34 and 62 of List II.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11.
			<lb />
			The learned counsel appearing for the parties have
			<lb />
			addressed lengthy arguments. Before the above questions
			<lb />
			are considered, it is useful to note the relevant constitutional
			<lb />
			provisions whereunder legislative powers are exercisable by
			<lb />
			the Parliament and the State Legislatures respectively.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12.
			<lb />
			Article 246 of the Constitution of India deals with
			<lb />
			the distribution of the legislative powers amongst the
			<lb />
			Parliament and the Legislatures of States, whereas Article
			<lb />
			248 deals with the residuary powers of legislation. Both the
			<lb />
			Articles are reproduced hereunder: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;
			<lb />
			246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and
			<lb />
			by the Legislatures of States. -(1) Notwithstanding anything
			<lb />
			in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to
			<lb />
			make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in
			<lb />
			List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred
			<lb />
			to as the &quot;Union List&quot;).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) Notwithstanding
			<lb />
			anything
			<lb />
			in clause (3),
			<lb />
			Parliament and, subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any
			<lb />
			State also, have power to make laws with respect to any of
			<lb />
			the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule
			<lb />
			(in this Constitution referred to as the &quot;Concurrent List&quot;).

			17.
			<lb />
			From the constitutional scheme contained in entry
			<lb />
			40 of List I and consequential law enacted by the
			<lb />
			Parliament, it is abundantly clear that the entry 40
			<lb />
			empowers the Parliament to make a regulatory law in
			<lb />
			respect to the lotteries. It is the common case of the parties
			<lb />
			that power to tax does not emanate from the power to make
			<lb />
			regulatory law. Similarly, entry 34 of the List II deals with
			<lb />
			the subject of &quot;betting and gambling&quot; and the State
			<lb />
			legislature has power to make regulatory law in respect of
			<lb />
			&quot;betting and gambling&quot;. It goes without saying and as
			<lb />
			interpreted by a plethora of judicial pronouncements, the
			<lb />
			conduct of lottery which is a game of chance falls within the
			<lb />
			ambit, scope and purview of expression &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;. Entry 34, however, does not empower the State
			<lb />
			to enact any law imposing any tax upon the activity of
			<lb />
			betting and gambling like entry 40 of List I. It is Entry 62
			<lb />
			that specifically provides for levy of taxes on &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.
			<lb />
			In the backdrop of aforesaid constitutional and
			<lb />
			statutory provisions, we shall take up the grounds noticed
			<lb />
			hereinabove for consideration in seriatim.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<head>
			GROUND -A
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			(I)
			<lb />
			Terms and conditions of Agreement dated
			<lb />
			10.08.2009 (Annexure 3) depict the mutual relationship
			<lb />
			between M/s. Future Gaming Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (petitioner)
			<lb />
			and the State Government. The preface of the Agreement
			<lb />
			shows that open tenders were invited for appointment of a
			<lb />
			purchaser for sale of lottery tickets of denomination of
			<lb />
			Re.1/-and above organized by the State Government for a
			<lb />
			period of 5 (five) years. Clause 4 of the Agreement further
			<lb />
			demonstrates that the petitioner was appointed as a sole
			<lb />
			purchaser on payment of lump sum amount of Rs.8.00
			<lb />
			crores p.a. for the first year of extension and Rs.10.00
			<lb />
			crores p.a. from the second year commencing from
			<lb />
			18.10.2010 till 17.10.2014. Clause 13 further shows that
			<lb />
			the petitioner&apos;s company is a sole purchaser of the lottery
			<lb />
			tickets organized by the State Government and unsold
			<lb />
			tickets are to be returned to the Government within 15
			<lb />
			(fifteen) days from the date of draw which would be
			<lb />
			destroyed after verification. Clause 20 of the Agreement
			<lb />
			permits the sole purchaser to take up any kind of publicity
			<lb />
			etc. through electronic media and other modes at its own
			<lb />
			cost and expense without any contribution from the State
			<lb />
			Government in this regard. Clause 23 further grants liberty
			<lb />
			to the sole purchaser to appoint stockists, selling agents or
			<lb />
			sellers for further resale of lottery tickets in different parts of
			<lb />
			the country on its own terms, risk and responsibility. Under
			<lb />
			Clause 26, the purchaser, i.e. the petitioner is required to
			<lb />
			pay full sale price of the tickets and to pay further
			<lb />
			Rs.5,000/-for each lottery draw on the lottery tickets
			<lb />
			actually sold by the purchaser. Clause 30 of the Agreement
			<lb />
			in no uncertain terms makes the sole purchaser (petitioner)
			<lb />
			responsible for appointment of stockists, selling agents or
			<lb />
			sellers for the sale of lottery tickets with further stipulation
			<lb />
			that the Government shall have no privity of contract with
			<lb />
			any such stockists, selling agents, etc.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(II)
			<lb />
			Based upon these contractual stipulations, it is
			<lb />
			contended on behalf of the petitioners that the relationship
			<lb />
			between the petitioners and the State Government is that of
			<lb />
			buyer and seller with further liberty to the buyer for re-sale
			<lb />
			to stockists, selling agents etc. on its own without any
			<lb />
			interference of the State Government. It is thus submitted
			<lb />
			that the appointment of the petitioner as a distributor and
			<lb />
			purchaser of lottery tickets is on principal to principal basis
			<lb />
			whereunder the petitioner purchases the tickets subject to
			<lb />
			right of resale, which is one of the permitted jural
			<lb />
			relationship between the seller and the purchaser in
			<lb />
			common law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(III)
			<lb />
			Mr. A. R. Madhav Rao, learned arguing counsel
			<lb />
			appearing for the petitioner, while explaining the conduct of
			<lb />
			lottery business, submits that lottery tickets are goods and
			<lb />
			actionable claim and thus excluded from various State sales
			<lb />
			tax legislations.
			<lb />
			To harness, he has referred to the
			<lb />
			definition of sale and purchase as provided under the Central
			<lb />
			Excise Act. Section 2(h) of the Central Excise Act, 1944
			<lb />
			defines sale and purchase and reads as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;
			<lb />
			(h)
			<lb />
			&quot;sale&quot; and &quot;purchase&quot;, with their grammatical
			<lb />
			variations and cognate expressions, mean any transfer of the
			<lb />
			possession of goods by one person to another in the ordinary
			<lb />
			course of trade or business for cash or deferred payment or
			<lb />
			other valuable consideration;&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(IV)
			<lb />
			Regarding the applicability of the above definition
			<lb />
			to the service tax, reference is made to Section 65-A (121)
			<lb />
			of the Finance Act, 1994, which reads as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; (121)
			<lb />
			words and expressions used but not defined in
			<lb />
			this Chapter and defined under Central Excise Act, 1944 (1 of
			<lb />
			1944) or the rules made thereunder, shall as far as may be,
			<lb />
			in relation to service tax as they apply in relation to a _____
			<lb />
			excise.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(V)
			<lb />
			Admittedly, the expression &quot;sale and purchase&quot;
			<lb />
			has not been defined in the Finance Act and thus the above
			<lb />
			definition prescribed in the Central Excise Act shall be
			<lb />
			applicable to all such transactions which may fall within the
			<lb />
			purview of the expression &quot;sale and purchase&quot; in relation to
			<lb />
			service tax. In Sunrise Associates v. Government of
			<lb />
			NCT of Delhi : (2006) 5 SCC 603, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has held that the lottery tickets are goods in the wider
			<lb />
			sense of the term though the lottery ticket is an actionable
			<lb />
			claim and it is only on account of statutory exclusion from
			<lb />
			definition of goods in various State sales tax laws that it has
			<lb />
			been held to be not goods. The relevant observations are
			<lb />
			contained in paragraph 36 quoted hereunder: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;36. We have noted earlier that all the statutory definitions
			<lb />
			of the word &quot;goods&quot; in the State sales tax laws have
			<lb />
			uniformly excluded, inter alia, actionable claims from the
			<lb />
			definition for the purposes of the Act. Were actionable
			<lb />
			claims, etc., not otherwise includible in the definition of
			<lb />
			&quot;goods&quot; there was no need for excluding them. In other
			<lb />
			words, actionable claims are &quot;goods&quot; but not for the
			<lb />
			purposes of the Sales Tax Acts and but for this statutory
			<lb />
			exclusion, an actionable claim would be &quot;goods&quot; or the
			<lb />
			subject-matter of ownership. Consequently, an actionable
			<lb />
			claim is movable property and &quot;goods&quot; in the wider sense of
			<lb />
			the term but a sale of an actionable claim would not be
			<lb />
			subject to the sales tax laws.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			It is pertinent to note that the earlier Writ Petition i.e. W.P.
			<lb />
			(C) No.19 of 2007, titled Martin Lottery Agencies Ltd.
			<lb />
			v. Union of India &amp; Ors. was decided by this Court holding
			<lb />
			the lottery ticket to be actionable claim and thus beyond the
			<lb />
			scope of &quot;service&quot; relying upon the judgment in Sunrise
			<lb />
			Associates (supra). The judgment of this Court in Martin
			<lb />
			Lottery Agencies Ltd. (supra) has not been interfered
			<lb />
			with by the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.3239 of 2009
			<lb />
			(supra) but dismissed the Appeal on some other reasons as
			<lb />
			noted above.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(VI)
			<lb />
			Opposing the contention of the learned counsel for
			<lb />
			the petitioners, Mr. Farooq Md. Razzak, Ld. Addl. Solicitor
			<lb />
			General (Kolkata) appearing for the Union of India, submits
			<lb />
			that the definition of &quot;taxable service&quot; has been statutorily
			<lb />
			provided under the impugned provision contained in Clause
			<lb />
			(zzzzn) to sub-section 105 of Section 65 of the Finance Act,
			<lb />
			1994 as amended vide Amendment Act of 2010 with effect
			<lb />
			from 01.07.2010, which, inter alia, includes the promotion
			<lb />
			and organising etc. of lotteries as a &quot;taxable service&quot;. The
			<lb />
			activities of the petitioners fall within the above mentioned
			<lb />
			provision.
			<lb />
			According to Mr. Razzak, the petitioners
			<lb />
			arrangement with the State Government for appointment as
			<lb />
			a buyer and distributor is dehors the provision of Section 4
			<lb />
			of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998. Referring to Section
			<lb />
			4(c), it is argued that the State Government alone is entitled
			<lb />
			to sell the tickets either itself or through distributors or
			<lb />
			selling agents and thus any other arrangement whereby the
			<lb />
			sale of the tickets is made by the State Government to a
			<lb />
			distributor who buys the tickets in bulk and then further sells
			<lb />
			to selling agents, is impermissible in law.
			<lb />
			His further
			<lb />
			submission is that the State sells the lottery tickets on
			<lb />
			commission basis. The MRP of the ticket is Re.1/-and it is
			<lb />
			sold at 70 paise per ticket to the petitioners in bulk and the
			<lb />
			30% commission received by the petitioners is for purposes
			<lb />
			of organizing and promoting the sale of the lottery ticket for
			<lb />
			the State, which activity is nothing but a &quot;service&quot; rendered
			<lb />
			to the State.
			<lb />
			Referring to various conditions of the
			<lb />
			Agreement between the petitioners and the State, it is
			<lb />
			argued that unsold tickets are returned to the State and
			<lb />
			refunded. According to him, the only conclusion which can
			<lb />
			thus be, is that the petitioners are rendering services to the
			<lb />
			State of Sikkim and hence liable to &quot;service tax&quot; in terms of
			<lb />
			the Section 65 (105) (zzzzn) of the Finance Act, 1994. He
			<lb />
			submits that similar provision introduced by way of an
			<lb />
			explanation to Section 65(19)(ii) of the Finance Act vide
			<lb />
			Amendment Act dated 16.05.2008 has been interpreted by
			<lb />
			this Court in W.P. (C) No.21 of 2009 (Annexure-6) titled
			<lb />
			M/s. Tashi Delek Gaming Solutions Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v.
			<lb />
			Union of India &amp; Ors. and other connected matters
			<lb />
			decided vide judgment dated 30.07.2010 upholding the vires
			<lb />
			of the Explanation. This Court has held that the Explanation
			<lb />
			is a substantive law and thus the activity of the petitioner
			<lb />
			falls within the definition of &quot;taxable service&quot;. The relevant
			<lb />
			observations are noticed hereunder: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;15. ………………………………………………………………………………… The
			<lb />
			fact remains that lottery tickets are purchased not for their
			<lb />
			consumption but for the purpose of marketing the same. In
			<lb />
			order to market lottery tickets petitioner is required, in terms
			<lb />
			of the agreement it has with the State Government, to put
			<lb />
			up and the petitioner in fact puts up advertisements. It
			<lb />
			thereby entices the ultimate buyer of lottery tickets to
			<lb />
			purchase the same. It thus promotes the activity of its
			<lb />
			client, the State Government, in organizing lottery. In the
			<lb />
			matter of enabling its client to sale a lottery ticket worth
			<lb />
			Rs.1/-at Rs.1/-to the ultimate buyer of lottery tickets
			<lb />
			petitioner renders service thus. The value of lottery tickets
			<lb />
			without the promotional and marketing activity of the
			<lb />
			petitioner is 70 paise, which by reason of marketing and
			<lb />
			promotional activity of the petitioner becomes Rs.1/-when
			<lb />
			the same reaches the ultimate purchaser of lottery tickets.
			<lb />
			Petitioner thus makes a value addition to the activity of
			<lb />
			organizing or conducting or promoting games of chance as
			<lb />
			that of lottery by the State Government from 70 paise to
			<lb />
			Rs.1/-by providing marketing and promotional service
			<lb />
			thereto by its activities as above.
			<lb />
			There is thus value
			<lb />
			addition by the petitioner in relation to game of chance,
			<lb />
			organized, conducted or promoted by the client of the
			<lb />
			petitioner namely, the State Government.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(VII)
			<lb />
			It is submitted that these observations
			<lb />
			denote correct interpretation of the law and are applicable
			<lb />
			with all force notwithstanding the deletion of the Explanation
			<lb />
			and introduction of the new provision akin to the
			<lb />
			Explanation. His submission is that the judgment though
			<lb />
			challenged before the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court is operative,
			<lb />
			there being no interim stay on it.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(VIII)
			<lb />
			To counter the above arguments, Mr. A. R.
			<lb />
			Madhav Rao, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner,
			<lb />
			submits that the activity of the petitioners of purchasing and
			<lb />
			selling the lottery tickets through its stockists and selling
			<lb />
			agents is a normal business activity of any purchaser of any
			<lb />
			goods. His submission is that the State has right to sell the
			<lb />
			tickets either itself or through distributors or selling agents
			<lb />
			and where the sale is absolute without any further
			<lb />
			prohibition on resale against the full sale consideration even
			<lb />
			to a distributor or a selling agent, the transaction is in the
			<lb />
			nature of sale and purchase and not between the principal
			<lb />
			and agent. It does not constitute an agency as submitted
			<lb />
			on behalf of the respondents.
			<lb />
			As regards the 30%
			<lb />
			discounted price of the lottery tickets carrying MRP Re.1/-is
			<lb />
			concerned, his contention is that 30 paise difference
			<lb />
			between the MRP of the lottery ticket at Re.1/-and the
			<lb />
			purchase price of 70 paise, is not a commission but a
			<lb />
			discount to the petitioner. This discount is towards the
			<lb />
			establishment expenditure of business and margin of profit
			<lb />
			for the petitioners and their stockists/selling agents, which is
			<lb />
			a normal and common business practice in every case of
			<lb />
			sale and purchase in commercial parlance.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(IX)
			<lb />
			On the first question whether the appointment of
			<lb />
			the petitioner as a distributor can constitute an agency, it is
			<lb />
			submitted that where the distributor or the purchaser acts
			<lb />
			as a wholesaler on payment of the total sale price, he is a
			<lb />
			buyer and not an agent. In Pioneer Tools &amp; Appliances
			<lb />
			Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India : (1989) 42 ELT 484, it has
			<lb />
			been held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5. This judgment clearly demonstrates the fallacy of the
			<lb />
			reasoning adopted by the first respondent in the order
			<lb />
			passed in revision. Mr. R.L. Dalal, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, however, laid emphasis upon the fact that
			<lb />
			Rallis India was described as the first petitioner&apos;s distributor.
			<lb />
			He referred me to the decision of the division bench of this
			<lb />
			court in Amar Dye-Chem Limited and another v. Union of
			<lb />
			India and another, 1981 E.L.T. 348. The court held that the
			<lb />
			distributor normally was an agent of the manufacturer for
			<lb />
			the purpose of distributing the goods to the consumers. He
			<lb />
			was not a buyer of the goods from the manufacturer on his
			<lb />
			own account and did not himself pay the price of the goods
			<lb />
			purchased before the goods were passed on to the
			<lb />
			consumer. But, merely by the use of the word &apos;distributor&apos; in
			<lb />
			the list filed by the petitioner, it could not be said that the
			<lb />
			distributor was a related person. What was material was the
			<lb />
			real substance of the transaction. If the distributor bought
			<lb />
			the goods and the price was the sole consideration of the
			<lb />
			sale and the transaction was at arms length, he could not be
			<lb />
			categorized as a related person. In the case of a buyer who
			<lb />
			purchased, the goods on payment of a commercial price,
			<lb />
			from the manufacturer and the transaction in effection was a
			<lb />
			sale, such a buyer even though a kind of distributor was
			<lb />
			different from the distributor who acted as an agent of or on
			<lb />
			behalf of the manufacturer. In such a case the distributor
			<lb />
			was in fact the wholesale buyer and the property and the
			<lb />
			goods passed such a buyer. It is difficult to see how this
			<lb />
			judgment furthers the respondents&apos; case. It is averred in the
			<lb />
			petitioner and, indeed, has been averred at all the times by
			<lb />
			the first petitioners before the authorities that they sold their
			<lb />
			products to Rallis India on an outright basis in a arms length
			<lb />
			transaction. There is no statement by the authorities which
			<lb />
			disputes this. There is no affidavit-in-reply which disputes
			<lb />
			the correctness of the averment made in the petition. It
			<lb />
			must, therefore, be accepted that this was the real nature of
			<lb />
			the transaction between them.
			<lb />
			This being so, it is
			<lb />
			immaterial that Rallis India is described as the distributor of
			<lb />
			the first petitioners.&quot;

		<p>
			(X)
			<lb />
			Above observations are sought to be applied to
			<lb />
			the present case on the basis of the agreemental
			<lb />
			stipulations which, inter alia, provide for payment of lump
			<lb />
			sum sale considerations for the entire financial year. Under
			<lb />
			Clause 4 of the Agreement the petitioner is required to pay
			<lb />
			Rs.10.00 crores p.a. as the minimum guaranteed amount to
			<lb />
			the State Government for purchase of the tickets
			<lb />
			irrespective of the fact whether petitioners suffer any loss or
			<lb />
			earn profit.
			<lb />
			The contractual stipulations noticed and
			<lb />
			discussed hereinabove further make it clear that the State
			<lb />
			Government has no concern with the further sale of the
			<lb />
			tickets by the petitioners except to comply the regulatory
			<lb />
			statutory provisions contained in the Lotteries (Regulation)
			<lb />
			Act, 1998 and rules made thereunder in public interest. The
			<lb />
			State Government is also not concerned with the amount of
			<lb />
			discount or margin of profit given by the petitioners to their
			<lb />
			stockists or selling agents.
			<lb />
			Rather condition 26 of
			<lb />
			Agreement clearly stipulates that the State Government
			<lb />
			shall have no privity of contract with the stockists, selling
			<lb />
			agents or the ultimate purchaser of lottery ticket in the
			<lb />
			street and it shall be the absolute responsibility and liability
			<lb />
			of the purchaser, i.e. the petitioners, in case of any dispute
			<lb />
			or claim. As regards the return of the unsold tickets is
			<lb />
			concerned, the statutory rules framed under the Lotteries
			<lb />
			(Regulation) Act, 1998 and the contractual stipulations
			<lb />
			therefor is again a question of regulation to prevent any
			<lb />
			fraud, mischief or unlawful enrichment by the purchaser if
			<lb />
			any unsold ticket carries any price after the draw, apart
			<lb />
			from it being an established legal and permissible trade
			<lb />
			practice.

			<lb />
			Sale distinguished from contract of agency. A
			<lb />
			supplier who agrees to procure goods from another may do
			<lb />
			so an the latter&apos;s agent or as a principal party in the
			<lb />
			relationship of a seller. The situation is parallel that already
			<lb />
			discussed in which the agreement is to manufacture and
			<lb />
			supply goods, the manufacturer may produce the goods on
			<lb />
			its own account and sell them when completed, or may be
			<lb />
			employed to work on the other party&apos;s behalf. A supplier
			<lb />
			who is a seller ordinarily contracts to supply the goods at an
			<lb />
			agreed price; this is an absolute undertaken and the actual
			<lb />
			cost to the supplier of the goods is irrelevant. A supplier
			<lb />
			who is an agent is merely bound to use due diligence to fulfill
			<lb />
			the order, although there is an obligation to obtain the goods
			<lb />
			as cheaply as is reasonably possible, and the agent&apos;s
			<lb />
			remuneration is normally by way of commission.

			<lb />
			To determine the nature of the transaction in
			<lb />
			these cases, the whole agreement must be looked at: &quot;the
			<lb />
			test is ultimately one of substance rather than form&quot;. There
			<lb />
			are certain indicators. It is not conclusive that the consignee
			<lb />
			should be described in the contract as an &apos;agent&apos; or even
			<lb />
			&apos;sole agent&apos;, or conversely that the transaction should be
			<lb />
			called as &apos;sale&apos;, although the way in which the parties label
			<lb />
			the transaction will, typically, play a significant part in the
			<lb />
			court&apos;s determination of the issue. Certain stipulations may
			<lb />
			be consistent with both sale (and especially sale or return)
			<lb />
			and agency, and, therefore, cannot be taken as indicative of
			<lb />
			either: for instance, the transfer to the consignee of the
			<lb />
			property in goods shipped upon the acceptance of drafts; a
			<lb />
			provision that the property in goods shall remain in the
			<lb />
			consignor until disposed of; of the fact that the price of sale
			<lb />
			to third parties is fixed by the consignor. Exceptionally an
			<lb />
			agent may be remunerated by keeping the surplus over and
			<lb />
			above a specified price which is received on account of the
			<lb />
			principal, while the buyer may be paid a sum described as
			<lb />
			commission.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			It is, however, evidence towards a sale that the recipient is
			<lb />
			entitled to sell at whatever price the recipient thinks fit,
			<lb />
			accounting to the supplier only for a predetermined sum, and
			<lb />
			this interpretation is given further support if the recipient is
			<lb />
			free to alter or improve the goods. An agent, even a del
			<lb />
			credere agent, acts in accordance with the principal, and is
			<lb />
			normally remunerated by commission. The nature of the
			<lb />
			consignee&apos;s obligation to account to the consignor is perhaps
			<lb />
			the strongest indication. The consignee is probably an agent
			<lb />
			if there is an obligation to furnish particulars of sale and
			<lb />
			customers or to account periodically for the proceeds of
			<lb />
			sales. Otherwise the consignee is likely to be acting as a
			<lb />
			principal in the sales and this conclusion is reinforced where
			<lb />
			the consignee pays wholesale prices of goods. If when the
			<lb />
			consignee sells (whether for cash or on credit) to a retail
			<lb />
			purchaser, this immediately gives rise to a debt to the
			<lb />
			supplier for the listed price, the transaction is quite
			<lb />
			inconsistent with agency, including del credere agency, and
			<lb />
			consistent only with sale or return.&quot;

			<lb />
			Agent and seller; agent and buyer. The above
			<lb />
			discussion raises the distinction between agency and sale.
			<lb />
			These relationships, unlike the others dealt with above, are
			<lb />
			mutually exclusive: in respect of a particular transaction a
			<lb />
			person cannot be acting as agent if he is a buyer or seller to
			<lb />
			his principal and vice versa. Sale is a commercially adverse
			<lb />
			relationship; agency involves a fiduciary relationship of trust
			<lb />
			and confidence. The solution to commercial disputes may
			<lb />
			frequently turn on whether the parties are to be regarded as
			<lb />
			parties to one or the other relationship.
			<lb />
			Thus a
			<lb />
			manufacturer may contract not to market his goods through
			<lb />
			anyone but a particular supplier. Who is said to be &apos;sole&apos; or
			<lb />
			&apos;exclusive agent&apos;. If the supplier is on the true construction
			<lb />
			of the agreement a buyer from the manufacturer, the
			<lb />
			manufacturer may be in breach of contract if he sells the
			<lb />
			goods himself; but if the supplier is a true agent the
			<lb />
			manufacturer will usually be entitled to sell personally as
			<lb />
			well. If the supplier buys from the manufacturer and resells,
			<lb />
			it is he who answers to the ultimate buyer for the quality of
			<lb />
			the goods, and the manufacturer is liable. …
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			...
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The distinction between agent and buyer for resale normally
			<lb />
			turns on whether the person concerned acts for himself to
			<lb />
			make such profit as he can, or is remunerated by pre-
			<lb />
			arranged commission. A supplier who himself fixes the
			<lb />
			resale price is likely to be a buyer for resale: but the fact
			<lb />
			that the resale price if fixed by the manufacturer does not
			<lb />
			necessarily make the supplier an agent, for resale prices are
			<lb />
			frequently fixed by manufacturers. Exceptionally a buyer for
			<lb />
			resale may also be paid commission, or an agent
			<lb />
			remunerated by being allowed to keep the excess over and
			<lb />
			above a stipulated price. But the making of such a profit by
			<lb />
			an agent would normally be improper.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			Conversely, there may be difficulty in deciding whether a
			<lb />
			person who has agreed to procure goods for another is
			<lb />
			acting as that other&apos;s agent or selling to him. Again, the first
			<lb />
			question is to ask whether he takes a profit on the resale
			<lb />
			which will make him a seller, or a commission, in which case
			<lb />
			he is likely to be an agent and indeed the making of any
			<lb />
			further profit would usually be improper.&quot;

			<lb />
			The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Alwaye Agencies
			<lb />
			v. Deputy Commission of Agricultural Income Tax :
			<lb />
			1998 (Supp) SCC 394, has held as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;6. In our opinion, since both the parties have proceeded
			<lb />
			on the footing that the transactions in question were effected
			<lb />
			pursuant to the said agreement, the primary task to which
			<lb />
			we must address ourselves is to examine whether under the
			<lb />
			agreement the assessee firm was an agent of the said
			<lb />
			company, or whether the assessee firm was really a
			<lb />
			purchaser of the goods which were booked by it. In this
			<lb />
			connection, it must be noticed that sub-clause (a) of clause 2
			<lb />
			provides that the distributor has the right of the sale of the
			<lb />
			product within the stipulated area.
			<lb />
			Bulk supplies were
			<lb />
			effected in wagon-load or lorry-load by the said company
			<lb />
			direct to the consumer, but only provided that the distributor
			<lb />
			arranged the payment as per the agreement and also took
			<lb />
			the responsibility to bear entirely the resultant effects and
			<lb />
			risk from said direct despatches. It is true that the price at
			<lb />
			which the goods were to be sold to the customers was fixed
			<lb />
			by the company but that itself does not necessarily lead to
			<lb />
			the conclusion that the assessee acted merely as an agent of
			<lb />
			the said company. In fact, it is well settled that the mere
			<lb />
			fact that the manufacturer fixes the sale price, by itself,
			<lb />
			cannot lead to the conclusion that the distributor is merely
			<lb />
			an agent. It is significant that under the agreement what the
			<lb />
			distributor got is described as a &quot;rebate&quot; and not as
			<lb />
			&quot;commission&quot;. As one would normally expect in an
			<lb />
			agreement of agency. This is a factor which is by no means
			<lb />
			conclusive, but to a certain extent indicative of the
			<lb />
			relationship between the said company and the assessee.
			<lb />
			What is most important is, however, that the supplies were
			<lb />
			made to the distributor against payment either immediate or
			<lb />
			deferred as provided in the agreement, and even when the
			<lb />
			goods were destined directly to the customer, it was the
			<lb />
			distributor who had to guarantee to arrange the payment.
			<lb />
			Clause 8 makes it quite clear that the arrangement for
			<lb />
			effecting payment had to be made by the distributor either in
			<lb />
			cash or by demand draft or by irrevocable letter of credit in
			<lb />
			the company&apos;s favour negotiable against R/R or other
			<lb />
			documents of dispatch of goods. It is also significant that
			<lb />
			where there was some time lag between the sending of the
			<lb />
			goods and the payment, the goods were to be insured at the
			<lb />
			cost of the assessee. This circumstance, in our opinion,
			<lb />
			clearly shows that in respect of the goods despatched under
			<lb />
			orders placed by the distributors, the distributors really acted
			<lb />
			as purchasers of the goods which they in turn sold to the
			<lb />
			customers and does not merely act as agents of the said
			<lb />
			company. In respect of the goods in question which were
			<lb />
			despatched through public carriers, although the invoices
			<lb />
			were prepared in the names of the consumers of the goods,
			<lb />
			and the goods were consigned to the destination through
			<lb />
			public carrier booked to self, as pointed out by the Tribunal,
			<lb />
			the bills were endorsed and handed over to the assessee.
			<lb />
			When considered in the light of the agreement, these
			<lb />
			circumstances clearly show that in respect of these
			<lb />
			transactions the property in the goods despatched passed to
			<lb />
			the distributor on the bills being endorsed and handed over
			<lb />
			to the distributors.&quot;

			A similar view has been expressed by the Hon&apos;ble

			Majid &amp; Co. : AIR 1967 SC 181.

			&quot;9. It is well-established that even an agent can become a
			<lb />
			purchaser when as agent pays the price to the principal on
			<lb />
			his own responsibility. In Ex parte White, in re Nevil, (1871)
			<lb />
			6 Ch. 397 t &amp; Co. were in the habit of sending goods for sale
			<lb />
			to N who was a partner in the firm of N &amp; Co., but received
			<lb />
			these goods on his private account. The course of de3aling
			<lb />
			between T &amp; Co. and N was that the goods were
			<lb />
			accompanied by a price list, N sold the goods on what terms
			<lb />
			he pleased, and each month sent to T &amp; Co., an account of
			<lb />
			the goods he had sold, debiting himself with the prices
			<lb />
			named for them in the price list, and at the expiration of
			<lb />
			another month he paid the amount in cash without any
			<lb />
			regard to the prices at which he had sold the goods, or the
			<lb />
			length of credit he had given. On these facts it was held by
			<lb />
			the Court of Appeal in Chancery that though both the parties
			<lb />
			might look upon the business as an agency, N did not, in
			<lb />
			fact, sell the goods as agent of T &amp; Co., but on his own
			<lb />
			account, upon the terms of his paying T &amp; Co. for them at a
			<lb />
			fixed rate if he sold them, and the moneys he received for
			<lb />
			them were therefore his own moneys, which T &amp; Co., had no
			<lb />
			right to follow.

			<lb />
			A similar principle has been expressed in W. T. Lamb
			<lb />
			and Sons v. Goring Brick Company, Ltd. [1932] 1 K.B. 710.
			<lb />
			In that case, certain manufacturers of bricks and other
			<lb />
			building materials, by an agreement in writing, appointed a
			<lb />
			firm of builders&apos; merchants as &quot;sole selling agents of all
			<lb />
			bricks and other materials manufactured at their works&quot;.
			<lb />
			The agreement was expressed to be for three years and
			<lb />
			afterwards continuous subject to twelve e months&apos; notice by
			<lb />
			either party.
			<lb />
			While the agreement was in force the
			<lb />
			manufacturers informed the merchants that they intended in
			<lb />
			the future to sell their goods themselves without the
			<lb />
			intervention of any agent, and thereafter they effected sales
			<lb />
			to customers directly. An action was then brought by the
			<lb />
			merchants for breach of the agreement. It was held by the
			<lb />
			Court of Appeal that the effect of the agreement was to
			<lb />
			confer on the plaintiffs the sole right of selling the goods
			<lb />
			manufactured by the defendants at their works, so that
			<lb />
			neither the defendants themselves nor any agent appointed
			<lb />
			by them, other than the plaintiffs, should have the right of
			<lb />
			selling such goods. It was also held that the agreement was
			<lb />
			one of vendor and purchaser and not one of principal and
			<lb />
			agent. Through the term &apos;agent&apos; was used in the agreement,
			<lb />
			the Court of Appeal considered that the substance of the
			<lb />
			transaction was that the manufacturers sold their bricks to
			<lb />
			the so-called agent who in turn sold them on their own
			<lb />
			responsibility to customers.
			<lb />
			The price charged by the
			<lb />
			manufacturers to the sole selling agents was the ruling
			<lb />
			market price and the sole selling agents were allowed a
			<lb />
			deduction of 10 per cent by way of commission on that price,
			<lb />
			the manufacturers had no concern at what rate the sole
			<lb />
			selling agents sold the goods to customers, it was clear from
			<lb />
			these facts that the sale by the selling agents to customers
			<lb />
			was a transaction in which the manufacturers were not
			<lb />
			interested and there was no privity of contract between the
			<lb />
			manufacturers and the ultimate purchasers.&quot;

		<p>
			This Model Agreement is said to have been circulated by the
			<lb />
			Central Government in exercise of its power under Section
			<lb />
			10 of the regulatory Act, wherein the Central Government is
			<lb />
			entitled to give directions to the State Government to carry
			<lb />
			out the provision of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998 and
			<lb />
			the rules made thereunder.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(XVI)
			<lb />
			Admittedly, this Circular issued in December, 2011
			<lb />
			has not been enforced so far and at least the State of Sikkim
			<lb />
			has not desired the Model Agreement to be executed by the
			<lb />
			petitioners.
			<lb />
			This Agreement thus cannot render much
			<lb />
			assistance to the petitioner. Mr. Rao, however, submits that
			<lb />
			the Agreement may not be construed to lay down any
			<lb />
			condition of contract between the State Government and the
			<lb />
			petitioner, nonetheless, it does indicate the intention of the
			<lb />
			Central Government in what manner the provisions of the
			<lb />
			regulatory law and the rules made thereunder have been
			<lb />
			understood and interpreted by the Central Government, the
			<lb />
			State Government as also the distributor appointed by the
			<lb />
			State. His submission is that all the lottery organising
			<lb />
			States like Sikkim and Kerala have entered into similar kinds
			<lb />
			of agreements with their distributors wherein the
			<lb />
			relationship between the State Government organising
			<lb />
			lottery and the distributors are that of a seller and buyer and
			<lb />
			not principal and agent. There is absolutely no dispute that
			<lb />
			from the nature of arrangement made between the State
			<lb />
			Government and the petitioner, who is termed as a
			<lb />
			distributor, it is evident that the State Government is selling
			<lb />
			its entire lot of lottery tickets published by it through the
			<lb />
			distributor (petitioner) for minimum guaranteed sale price
			<lb />
			with complete liberty to the distributor, the purchaser of the
			<lb />
			lottery tickets to further sell it by appointing selling agents,
			<lb />
			sub-agents etc. without any interference by the State
			<lb />
			Government except to monitor the adherence of the
			<lb />
			regulatory provisions contained in the Regulatory Act and
			<lb />
			the rules made thereunder.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(XVII) Another related issue raised by the respondents is
			<lb />
			that the mutual arrangement between the State
			<lb />
			Government and the distributor for re-purchase of the
			<lb />
			unsold lottery tickets and refund thereon goes against the
			<lb />
			very concept of the sale and purchase of goods.
			<lb />
			To
			<lb />
			appreciate, it is necessary to understand the basis for such
			<lb />
			stipulation. Firstly, the re-deposit of the unsold lottery
			<lb />
			tickets is a statutory requirement under Sub-rule (5) of Rule
			<lb />
			4 of the Rules framed under the Act and additionally, the
			<lb />
			object is to prevent any fraudulent claim of the prize money
			<lb />
			on any unsold ticket by the distributor or its selling agent
			<lb />
			etc. Secondly, such an arrangement is legally permissible in
			<lb />
			case of sale of goods, which, in normal and common trade
			<lb />
			practices, is known as &quot;on sale or return&quot;. Mr. Rao submits
			<lb />
			that it is one of the recognized modes of sale where unsold
			<lb />
			goods can be returned to the manufacturer or the seller and
			<lb />
			such an arrangement does not tamper with the concept of
			<lb />
			sale and purchase. He has referred to the well-known
			<lb />
			commentary of Benjamin&apos;s Sale of Goods, 8 th Edition,
			<lb />
			which reads as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5-041.
			<lb />
			Approval or on sale or return. The rule
			<lb />
			requires that the goods must have been delivered to the
			<lb />
			buyer &quot;on approval or on sale or return or other similar
			<lb />
			terms&quot;. Goods will be considered to have been delivered on
			<lb />
			approval where it is agreed by the parties that they shall be
			<lb />
			retained and purchased by the buyer at the notified prices if
			<lb />
			he approves them, but not if they are disapproved. The
			<lb />
			meaning of a contract &apos;on sale or return&apos; is that the goods
			<lb />
			are to be taken as sold at the option of the buyer, if not
			<lb />
			previously rejected, unless returned to the seller within the
			<lb />
			time fixed by the contract or within a reasonable time. A
			<lb />
			contract can be one on sale or return whether or not the
			<lb />
			recipient of the goods under the contract intends to buy
			<lb />
			them himself or sell them to third parties.
			<lb />
			Goods are
			<lb />
			delivered on &apos;other similar terms&apos; where, for example, they
			<lb />
			are sent on trial or on approbation. But, in order to bring a
			<lb />
			transaction within this rule, the circumstances must show
			<lb />
			that the buyer has an option to purchase on the statutory
			<lb />
			terms, that is to say, if and when the specific acts or conduct
			<lb />
			on his part set out in the rule have occurred. For this reason,
			<lb />
			it is necessary to distinguish certain closely related forms of
			<lb />
			transaction where a different intention appears.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(XVIII) The sum and substance of the above discussion is
			<lb />
			that once the transaction between two contracting parties
			<lb />
			involves only sale and purchase including &quot;on sale or
			<lb />
			return&quot;, the relationship is simply that of a seller and
			<lb />
			purchaser, it does not constitute any service. In Bharat
			<lb />
			Sanchar Nigam Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. :
			<lb />
			(2006) 3 SCC 1, it has been held as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 88.
			<lb />
			No one denies the legislative competence of the
			<lb />
			States to levy sales tax on sales provided that the necessary
			<lb />
			concomitants of a sale are present in the transaction and the
			<lb />
			sale is distinctly discernible in the transaction. This does not
			<lb />
			however allow the State to entrench upon the Union List and
			<lb />
			tax services by including the cost of such service in the value
			<lb />
			of the goods. Even in those composite contracts which are
			<lb />
			by legal fiction deemed to be divisible under Article 366 (29-
			<lb />
			A), the value of the goods involved in the execution of the
			<lb />
			whole transaction cannot be assessed to sales tax. As was
			<lb />
			said in Larsen &amp; Toubro v. Union of India : (SCC p.395, para
			<lb />
			47)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;The cost of establishment of the contractor
			<lb />
			which is relatable to supply of labour and services
			<lb />
			cannot be included in the value of the goods involved in
			<lb />
			the execution of a contract and the cost of
			<lb />
			establishment which is relatable to supply of material
			<lb />
			involved in the execution of the works contract only can
			<lb />
			be included in the value of the goods.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			89.
			<lb />
			For the same reason the Centre cannot include
			<lb />
			the value of the SIM cards, if they are found ultimately to be
			<lb />
			goods, in the cost of the service. As was held by us in
			<lb />
			Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. v. Union of India, SCC at
			<lb />
			p.228, para 23:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;This mutual exclusivity which has been
			<lb />
			reflected in Article 246(1) means that taxing entries
			<lb />
			must be construed so as to maintain exclusivity.
			<lb />
			Although generally speaking, a liberal interpretation
			<lb />
			must be given to taxing entries, this would not bring
			<lb />
			within its purview a tax on subject matter which a fair
			<lb />
			reading of the entry does not cover. If in substance, the
			<lb />
			statute is not referable to a field given to the State, the
			<lb />
			court will not by any principle of interpretation allow a
			<lb />
			statute not covered by it to intrude upon this field.&quot;.&quot;

			(XIX)
			<lb />
			In Imagic Creative (P) Ltd. v. Commissioner
			<lb />
			of Commercial Taxes &amp; Ors. : (2008) 2 SCC 614, while
			<lb />
			considering the question of levy of service tax as also VAT
			<lb />
			on a transaction, it has been held that payment of service
			<lb />
			tax as also VAT are mutually exclusive and both the kind of
			<lb />
			taxes can be levied in a composite transaction having regard
			<lb />
			to the respective parameters of service tax and the sales
			<lb />
			tax. The relevant observations are made in the following
			<lb />
			paragraph:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;32. Payments of service tax as also VAT are mutually
			<lb />
			exclusive. Therefore, they should be held to be applicable
			<lb />
			having regard to the respective parameters of service tax
			<lb />
			and the sales tax as envisaged in a composite contract as
			<lb />
			contradistinguished from an indivisible contract.
			<lb />
			It may
			<lb />
			consist of different elements providing for attracting different
			<lb />
			nature of levy. It is, therefore, difficult to hold that in a case
			<lb />
			of this nature, sales tax would be payable on the value of the
			<lb />
			entire contract, irrespective of the element of service
			<lb />
			provided. The approach of the assessing authority, to us,
			<lb />
			thus, appears to be correct.&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
			In Indian Railways C. &amp; T. Corpn. Ltd. v. Govt.
			<lb />
			of NCT of Delhi : 2010 (20) S.T.R. 437 (Del.), the
			<lb />
			question before Delhi High Court was whether the supplier of
			<lb />
			food and beverages to the Railways for consumption of
			<lb />
			passenger travelling therein includes the element of service
			<lb />
			and subject to levy of service tax.
			<lb />
			Considering this
			<lb />
			question, Delhi High Court observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 4.
			<lb />
			The next question raised is with regard to the
			<lb />
			respondent&apos;s liability for service tax on collections for
			<lb />
			disposal of garbage.
			<lb />
			Even though there is no written
			<lb />
			agreement for the collections, the Tribunal, on facts, found
			<lb />
			that the charges represent value for the materials sold and
			<lb />
			not for any service rendered by the respondent. So much
			<lb />
			so, we do not find any ground to interfere with the Tribunal&apos;s
			<lb />
			order vacating the service tax demands from the respondent
			<lb />
			for the collections and from the parties referred above. We
			<lb />
			do not find any merit in the appeals filed by the Department.
			<lb />
			Consequently, the appeals are dismissed.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(XXI)
			<lb />
			From the discussion and consideration of
			<lb />
			judgments noticed hereinabove, it clearly emerges that
			<lb />
			where the transaction is purely that of sale and purchase
			<lb />
			and does not involve any component of service in it, which
			<lb />
			cannot be clearly segregated and discernible, no service tax
			<lb />
			is payable.
			<lb />
			However, where two components in a
			<lb />
			transaction, i.e. &quot;sale&quot; and &quot;service&quot;, are capable of
			<lb />
			compartmentalisation so as to segregate the element of
			<lb />
			service from the transaction of sale, service tax may be
			<lb />
			leviable on the service component in a transaction.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(XXII) Another related question that was forcefully and
			<lb />
			vehemently argued on both the sides was regarding the
			<lb />
			amount of discount provided on the MRP of the lottery
			<lb />
			ticket. Both the sides have argued on this issue in their own
			<lb />
			manner. At the cost of repetition, Mr. Farooq Md. Razzak,
			<lb />
			Addl. Solicitor General submits that a 30% discount on the
			<lb />
			lottery ticket granted to the petitioner is by way of
			<lb />
			commission in lieu of the services rendered by it to the State
			<lb />
			Government. To the contrary it has been urged on behalf of
			<lb />
			the petitioners that the 30% discount on MRP i.e. the
			<lb />
			actual/final sale price meant for the last purchaser, is in fact
			<lb />
			a normal business discount in any transaction of sale. His
			<lb />
			further submission is that none of the activities of the
			<lb />
			petitioner amounts to rendering any service to the
			<lb />
			Government nor is there any consideration received by the
			<lb />
			petitioner from the Government for such activities. On the
			<lb />
			contrary, the petitioner is paying the sale consideration and
			<lb />
			other amounts on regular draws leviable under law to the
			<lb />
			Government. Undisputedly, the MRP for a lottery ticket
			<lb />
			organized by the State of Sikkim is Re.1/-and the same is
			<lb />
			sold to the petitioner on a discounted price of 70 paise in
			<lb />
			bulk. However, the petitioner is under contractual obligation
			<lb />
			to pay minimum guaranteed price of Rs.10.00 crores per
			<lb />
			year. It is argued that since the unsold tickets are required
			<lb />
			to be returned to the Government, there is no absolute sale.
			<lb />
			It is also stated that clause 20, which grants liberty to the
			<lb />
			purchaser to take up any kind of publicity for the sale of the
			<lb />
			lottery tickets through electronic media or any other mode,
			<lb />
			further suggests that the petitioner is facilitating the
			<lb />
			organisation of the lottery, its promotion and sale in various
			<lb />
			parts of the Country. According to Mr. Razzak, this, in true
			<lb />
			spirit, constitutes a service for which the petitioner is getting
			<lb />
			30% commission by way of discounted price. Opposing this
			<lb />
			contention, the petitioner&apos;s case is that the 30% discounted
			<lb />
			price is for the purposes of the petitioner and his
			<lb />
			stockists/sellers profit components and other expenditure
			<lb />
			that would be incurred for sale of the lottery tickets.
			<lb />
			According to Mr. Rao, the discounted price in any sale
			<lb />
			transaction is normal and common business practice
			<lb />
			between a seller and a purchaser. After the lottery tickets
			<lb />
			are printed by the State Government, the same are required
			<lb />
			to be delivered to the petitioner at the agreed destination in
			<lb />
			terms of clause 13 of the Agreement and thereafter, it is the
			<lb />
			sole responsibility of the petitioner to sell the lottery tickets
			<lb />
			through stockists, selling agents or retail sellers as may be
			<lb />
			deemed convenient and the State Government can neither
			<lb />
			interfere with nor have any control over the stockists and
			<lb />
			selling agents appointed by the petitioner. Thus the State
			<lb />
			Government receiving the minimum guaranteed price sits
			<lb />
			pretty safe without any liability for profit or loss as the case
			<lb />
			may be. It becomes the exclusive responsibility of the
			<lb />
			petitioner to sell the tickets and, even if the petitioner is
			<lb />
			unable to sell the entire lot and sale proceeds of the sold
			<lb />
			tickets are less than the minimum guaranteed price paid by
			<lb />
			it to the Government, the Government is not liable to refund
			<lb />
			any part of the sale consideration including the unsold
			<lb />
			tickets. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that after
			<lb />
			the purchase of the tickets, the petitioner becomes the sole
			<lb />
			owner of the lottery tickets with liberty to re-sell according
			<lb />
			to its own scheme and management.
			<lb />
			The discounted
			<lb />
			amount is to be distributed as component of profit and
			<lb />
			expenditure by the petitioner, his stockists, selling agents
			<lb />
			and retail sellers. The advertisement for the lottery is not
			<lb />
			being made for the benefit of the State but for promotion of
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s own business activity.
			<lb />
			Rather than being
			<lb />
			reimbursed with the amounts spent for such advertisements,
			<lb />
			clause 20 of the Agreement clearly stipulates that the
			<lb />
			petitioner shall be liable for incurring all expenses for the
			<lb />
			advertisements and, even the result is to be published by
			<lb />
			the petitioner at its own expense. It is thus submitted by
			<lb />
			Mr. Rao that unless there is a consideration for services
			<lb />
			rendered, it would not fall within the meaning of &quot;taxable
			<lb />
			service&quot; as defined under clause (zzzzn) to Sub-section
			<lb />
			(105) of Section 65, which prescribes that the service
			<lb />
			provided by one person to another necessarily has to be for
			<lb />
			consideration.
			<lb />
			It is stated that the petitioner is not
			<lb />
			rendering any service to the Government rather it is
			<lb />
			promoting its own business interest and the State
			<lb />
			Government is not paying any consideration in any form
			<lb />
			whatsoever to the petitioner for such promotional and sale
			<lb />
			activities and such activities are primarily for the benefit of
			<lb />
			the petitioner though enhanced sale is beneficial to State as
			<lb />
			well. According to Mr. Rao, the discounted amount cannot
			<lb />
			be said to be a consideration for services, particularly, when
			<lb />
			it is optional for the petitioner to make any advertisement.

			(XXIII) In Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. v. Union of
			<lb />
			India &amp; Anr. reported as 1984 (16) E.L.T. 76 (Bom.), it
			<lb />
			has been held that where distributor purchases goods on
			<lb />
			payment of a commercial price from the manufacturer, such
			<lb />
			a buyer is different from a distributor and does not create an
			<lb />
			agency. The relevant observations are noticed hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 10.
			<lb />
			Shri Dalal submitted that the agreement
			<lb />
			between the petitioners and Voltas is really not a
			<lb />
			distributorship agreement but is in the nature of agreement
			<lb />
			agency. The learned counsel relied upon Division Bench
			<lb />
			decision of this Court in the case of Amer Dye-Chem Limited
			<lb />
			and another v. Union of India and another reported in 1981
			<lb />
			Excise Law Times, 348 and submitted that the mere use of
			<lb />
			the word &apos;Distributor&apos; would not lead to the conclusion that
			<lb />
			the agreement is not an agreement of agency. The Division
			<lb />
			Bench observed that the distributor in the commercial world
			<lb />
			is understood to be person who distributes goods of the
			<lb />
			manufacturer to the consumer and in so doing he acts for
			<lb />
			and on behalf of the manufacturer. The distributor normally
			<lb />
			is, therefore, an agent of the manufacturer for the purpose
			<lb />
			of reaching out the goods to the consumers. Shri Dalal
			<lb />
			relied upon this observation and claims that Voltas were
			<lb />
			merely acting as Agents of the petitioners for reaching out
			<lb />
			the tractors to the consumers.
			<lb />
			The submission is not
			<lb />
			correct, as the Division Bench has further observed in the
			<lb />
			judgment that in the case of the buyer who purchases goods
			<lb />
			on payment of a commercial price to the manufacturer and
			<lb />
			transaction in effect is a sale, such a buyer is different from
			<lb />
			the distributor earlier noticed, though even such a buyer is
			<lb />
			sometimes described as a distributor. The distributor in such
			<lb />
			a case is in fact a wholesale buyer and the property in the
			<lb />
			goods passes to such a buyer. The submission of Shri Dalal,
			<lb />
			therefore, that as the agreement between the petitioners and
			<lb />
			the Voltas was described as a distributorship agreement, it
			<lb />
			should be treated as an agreement of agency cannot be
			<lb />
			accepted.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			11.
			<lb />
			Shri Dalal then submitted that under the
			<lb />
			agreement, the Voltas were required to carry out the
			<lb />
			activities of the manufacturers and, therefore, want the
			<lb />
			petitioners intended to do was to transfer some of the
			<lb />
			activities of the manufacturers to Voltas with a view to
			<lb />
			reduce the assessable value for the purpose of excise. In
			<lb />
			support of this submission, reliance is placed on three or four
			<lb />
			conditions under the agreement. It was urged that the
			<lb />
			Voltas were required to maintain a Sales Organisation and
			<lb />
			such a condition was not necessary in the agreement if the
			<lb />
			petitioners had sold the tractors to Voltas because then it
			<lb />
			was wholly irrelevant to provide as to how the Voltas should
			<lb />
			dispose of those tractors to the consumers. The condition
			<lb />
			under the agreement which provides that Voltas were to
			<lb />
			store the tractors till they are sold to the consumers was also
			<lb />
			relied upon to claim that the agreement was not at arms
			<lb />
			length. The provision which required Voltas to carry out
			<lb />
			afte4r-sale service and the condition which required the
			<lb />
			petitioners to share half the amount spent on advertisements
			<lb />
			were highlighted to claim that the price for which the tractors
			<lb />
			were sold to Voltas did not reflect the true price. It was
			<lb />
			urged that the price at which the tractors were sold by the
			<lb />
			petitioners to Voltas was far less than the market price
			<lb />
			because certain activities required to be performed by the
			<lb />
			manufacturers were taken over by the Voltas. It is not
			<lb />
			possible to accept this submission. In the first instance, on
			<lb />
			the date when the agreement was entered into, the tractors
			<lb />
			were not liable to be assessed for excise duty and, therefore,
			<lb />
			there was no occasion to prepare an agreement with an
			<lb />
			intention to avoid the duty.
			<lb />
			Secondly, the conditions
			<lb />
			requiring Voltas to set up Sales Organisation and to provide
			<lb />
			after-sale service are the usual conditions provided in the
			<lb />
			agreement with the wholesale buyer and such conditions
			<lb />
			were also in existence in the agreement which was
			<lb />
			considered by the Supreme Court in the Voltas&apos; case. The
			<lb />
			fact that the Voltas were required to store the tractors till
			<lb />
			they are sold to the consumers cannot be treated as transfer
			<lb />
			of manufacturer&apos;s activity in favour of the buyer. The fact
			<lb />
			that the expenses in regard to the advertisements were to be
			<lb />
			shared by the petitioners and Voltas merely indicate that
			<lb />
			both the wholesale buyer and the petitioners were interested
			<lb />
			in having greater production and sale thereof and that
			<lb />
			condition, in my judgment, cannot be considered as relevant
			<lb />
			to reach the conclusion that the agreement was not at arms
			<lb />
			length.&quot;

			(XXIV) In Pioneer Tools and Appliances (P) Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Union of India : 1989 (42) E.L.T. 384 (Bom.), it has
			<lb />
			been held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5. This judgment clearly demonstrates the fallacy of the
			<lb />
			reasoning adopted by the first respondent in the order
			<lb />
			passed in revision. Mr. R. L. Dalal, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, however, laid emphasis upon the fact that
			<lb />
			Rallis India was described as the first petitioner&apos;s distributor.
			<lb />
			He referred me to the decision of the division bench of this
			<lb />
			court in Amar Dye-Chem Limited and another v. Union of
			<lb />
			India and another, 1981 E.L.T. 348. The court held that the
			<lb />
			distributor normally was an agent of the manufacturer for
			<lb />
			the purpose of distributing the goods to the consumers. He
			<lb />
			was not a buyer of the goods from the manufacturer on his
			<lb />
			own account and did not himself pay the price of the goods
			<lb />
			purchased before the goods were passed on to the
			<lb />
			consumer. But, merely by the use of the word &apos;distributor&apos; in
			<lb />
			the list filed by the petitioner, it could not be said that the
			<lb />
			distributor was a related person. What was material was the
			<lb />
			real substance of the transaction. If the distributor bought
			<lb />
			the goods and the price was the sole consideration of the
			<lb />
			sale and the transaction was at arms length, he could not be
			<lb />
			categorized as a related person. In the case of a buyer who
			<lb />
			purchased, the goods on payment of a commercial price,
			<lb />
			from the manufacturer and the transaction in effection was a
			<lb />
			sole, such a buyer even though a kind of distributor was
			<lb />
			different from the distributor who acted as an agent of or on
			<lb />
			behalf of the manufacturer. In such a case the distributor
			<lb />
			was in fact the wholesale buyer and the property and the
			<lb />
			goods passed such a buyer. It is difficult to see how this
			<lb />
			judgment furthers the respondent&apos;s case. It is averred in the
			<lb />
			petition and, indeed, has been averred at all the times by the
			<lb />
			first petitioners before the authorities that they sold their
			<lb />
			products to Rallis India on an outright basis in a arms length
			<lb />
			transaction. There is no statement by the authorities which
			<lb />
			disputes this. There is no affidavit-in-reply which disputes
			<lb />
			the correctness of the averment made in the petition. It
			<lb />
			must, therefore, be accepted that this was the real nature of
			<lb />
			the transaction between them.
			<lb />
			This being so, it is
			<lb />
			immaterial that Rallis India is described as the distributor of

			(XXV)
			<lb />
			In Philips India Ltd. v. Collector of Central
			<lb />
			Excise : (1997) 91 E.L.T. 540, it has been held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;6. As to the after sales service that the dealer was
			<lb />
			required under the agreement to provide, it did of course
			<lb />
			enhance in the eyes of intending purchasers the value of the
			<lb />
			appellant&apos;s product, but such enhancement of value ensured
			<lb />
			not only for the benefit of the appellant; it also ensured for
			<lb />
			the benefit of the dealer for, by reason thereof, the dealer
			<lb />
			got to sell more and earn a larger profit. The guarantee
			<lb />
			attached to the appellant&apos;s products specified that they could
			<lb />
			be repaired during the guarantee period by the appellant&apos;s
			<lb />
			dealers anywhere in the country. Thus, though one dealer
			<lb />
			might have to repair goods sold by another dealer and incur
			<lb />
			costs in that regard, he also had the benefit of having the
			<lb />
			goods he sold reparable throughout the country.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			provision as to after sales service, therefore, benefitted not
			<lb />
			only the appellant; it was a provision of mutual benefit to the
			<lb />
			appellant and the dealer.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(XXVI) Similarly, in Collector of Central Excise,
			<lb />
			Baroda v. Besta Cosmetics Ltd. reported as 2005 (183)
			<lb />
			E.L.T. 122 (SC), it has been held that the clause of
			<lb />
			advertisement being purely optional would not militate
			<lb />
			against the price which is at arm&apos;s length. The following
			<lb />
			observations are relevant: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>&quot;</p>

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			In addition, we may note that the relevant
			<lb />
			clause in the agreement between the assessee and its
			<lb />
			Marketing Agent relating to advertisements reads as follows
			<lb />
			(wherein the marketing agent is referred to as BHPL) :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;BHPL shall market the said product in the trade
			<lb />
			name or the trademark of BCL in respect of the said
			<lb />
			product. BHPL may, at its own free will, make it known
			<lb />
			generally that the products of BCL are marketed by
			<lb />
			them. BHPL for this matter, may adopt such ways and
			<lb />
			means and may incur such expenses on Advertising and
			<lb />
			Business promotion as it may deem fit and necessary.
			<lb />
			At the same time, BHPL should ensure that it does not
			<lb />
			infringe or in any way prejudicially effect the trade
			<lb />
			name and or trademark of the said product.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3.
			<lb />
			The appellant has sought to rely upon the
			<lb />
			decision of this Court in Commissioner of Central Excise,
			<lb />
			Surat v. Surat Textile Mills Ltd. -2004 (5) SCC 201. In that
			<lb />
			decision the Court appears to have upheld the view that
			<lb />
			where the advertisement cost is incurred by the
			<lb />
			manufacturers/customers compulsorily or mandatorily, and
			<lb />
			where the manufacturer has an enforceable legal right
			<lb />
			against the customers to insist on incurring of such
			<lb />
			advertisement
			<lb />
			expenditure
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			customers,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			advertisement cost would be includible in the assessable
			<lb />
			value. Without in any fashion affirming the view taken
			<lb />
			therein it is clear even on the basis of the judgment that the
			<lb />
			clause in question gave the manufacturers/marketing agent,
			<lb />
			the discretion whether or not to advertise the assessee&apos;s
			<lb />
			products. There was no &apos;enforceable legal right&apos; with the
			<lb />
			assessee to insist on the advertisement under the
			<lb />
			agreement.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(XXVII) A question whether discount granted by the State
			<lb />
			of Kerala on sale of lotteries to distributors was in the nature
			<lb />
			of commission liable to income tax deduction at source
			<lb />
			under Income Tax Act came to be considered by High Court
			<lb />
			of Kerala in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax,
			<lb />
			Thiruvananthapuram v. M. S. Hameed. It has been held
			<lb />
			that the relationship between the distributors in the trade of
			<lb />
			lottery as being one of principal to principal and the discount
			<lb />
			of lottery is not a commission, the provision of Section
			<lb />
			194(G) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which obliged a person
			<lb />
			to deduct tax at source on payment of commission, will not
			<lb />
			be attracted.
			<lb />
			The relevant extract of the judgment is
			<lb />
			reproduced hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;
			<lb />
			4. The petitioners receive in bulk quantities of lottery
			<lb />
			tickets from the State Government.
			<lb />
			They are given a
			<lb />
			discount which is on a slab system. Exhibit P-1 is the
			<lb />
			governing order issued in 1998. The agents commission
			<lb />
			presently payable is as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 100 tickets 25%
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 101 and above 27.5%
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 50,001 and above 28%
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 70,00,001 and above 28.5%
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			5.
			<lb />
			The import of the order will be that for a ticket worth
			<lb />
			Re. 1 an agent need pay between 75 paise to 71.5 paise
			<lb />
			only, depending on the off take. The petitioner submits that
			<lb />
			there is no agency agreement, and the petitioners are
			<lb />
			termed as agents only on a loose basis. From the nature of
			<lb />
			the transactions, the Government and the petitioners deal as
			<lb />
			principal to principal. The tickets purchased are thereafter
			<lb />
			distributed through other agents, and sub-agents, according
			<lb />
			to them, on commission basis. They point out that after
			<lb />
			purchase of the tickets, it is not the Government&apos;s look out
			<lb />
			as to how and when they are divided or distributed, and
			<lb />
			there is no control over the affairs thereafter. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			principal contention of the petitioner is that there is only
			<lb />
			payment of the price of the tickets fixed as payable by the
			<lb />
			principal, and no commission or discount are paid to them by
			<lb />
			the Government.
			<lb />
			As such, it is the contention of the
			<lb />
			petitioners that Section 194G of the Act has no application,
			<lb />
			and hence the demand of tax, as coming through exhibit P-4
			<lb />
			is unsustainable and without jurisdiction.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………

		<item>
			7.
			<lb />
			Before exhibit P-4, the deduction of ten per cent, was
			<lb />
			not being made, and the petitioners submit that thereafter
			<lb />
			the tax deduction has commenced. The submission of Mr. K.
			<lb />
			R. Prasad, senior counsel, appearing on instructions, for the
			<lb />
			petitioners, could be summarized as following: The
			<lb />
			provisions for collection and recovery of Income Tax
			<lb />
			appearing in Chapter XVII of the Act refers to various
			<lb />
			methods, viz., deduction at source, collection at source,
			<lb />
			advance payment of tax, collection by recovery and levy of
			<lb />
			interests, etc. Since Section 194G comes within the sub-
			<lb />
			heading &quot;Deduction at source&quot;, for the mechanism, according
			<lb />
			to counsel, a statutory authorization is essential. When the
			<lb />
			petitioners purchase tickets, they became absolute owners
			<lb />
			thereof. He also referred to Rule 25 of the Kerala State
			<lb />
			Lottery Rules, to the effect that in the case of loss of tickets,
			<lb />
			no compensation was payable. The petitioners were never
			<lb />
			agents of the State, and in no capacity, render any service to
			<lb />
			the State. For the face value of a ticket of Rs. 1, the
			<lb />
			petitioners were expected to pay 71.5 paise and they could
			<lb />
			have purchased a ticket worth one rupee by raising only 71.5
			<lb />
			paise. That the ticket might be worth one rupee did not
			<lb />
			mean that the balance of 28.5 paise was the petitioner&apos;
			<lb />
			income. Referring to the text book (Kanga and Palkiwala on
			<lb />
			Income-tax) (page 92, 7 th edition) he referred to the
			<lb />
			discussion based on the authorities to urge that mere relief
			<lb />
			from expense cannot be income. A person is chargeable to
			<lb />
			tax not on what he saves in his pocket, but what goes into
			<lb />
			his pocket. Counsel urged that Section 194G, as it stands in
			<lb />
			the statute book, cannot have application to the petitioners,
			<lb />
			as has been attempted to the explained by exhibit P-4.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			16
			<lb />
			If the face value of the ticket, for example, is Re. 1,
			<lb />
			notwithstanding the circumstance the petitioners receive it
			<lb />
			for 72 paise.
			<lb />
			The State, therefore, releases a ticket,
			<lb />
			receiving 72 paise. The petitioner may sell the ticket so
			<lb />
			obtained at any price of their choice. It is not the State&apos;s
			<lb />
			business to enquire into the matter at all. Therefore, it is
			<lb />
			difficult to assume that the petitioners have in all cases made
			<lb />
			a margin of 28 paise by the mere purchase of the ticket. His
			<lb />
			case is that resells it for 72.5 paise, and he derives a profit of
			<lb />
			half paise per ticket. He may be right or that may be a
			<lb />
			misleading statement. But he has been able to obtain a
			<lb />
			ticket worth Re. 1 for 72 paise. His total input therefore is
			<lb />
			72 paise, and in that context it is difficult to describe the
			<lb />
			transaction as one whereby because of investment of 72
			<lb />
			paise he has simultaneously made a profit of 28 paise.
			<lb />
			Several &quot;ifs&quot; have to be employed, which do not exist in real
			<lb />
			life, for this court to accept the case of the Department that
			<lb />
			by the factum of purchase he had already made a profit.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………

		<item>
			23.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the demand of tax is to be shown as one on
			<lb />
			the income of the person concerned.
			<lb />
			There is neither
			<lb />
			payment of cash or by cheque, and the Government never
			<lb />
			credits any income to the account of the persons like the
			<lb />
			petitioners. When the deduction is contemplated at the time
			<lb />
			of payment to the person concerned and when it is shown
			<lb />
			that there is no payment to the agent at the time of
			<lb />
			purchase of the ticket, the section automatically becomes
			<lb />
			inapplicable. If any prize or remuneration is payable by the
			<lb />
			Government, to any person, deduction at source as
			<lb />
			envisaged under the section, may arise.
			<lb />
			But when no
			<lb />
			payment is made in view of the mandate of the section, no
			<lb />
			deduction is envisaged.
			<lb />
			That the ticket is given on a
			<lb />
			discount of 28 per cent., can by no imagination be pressed
			<lb />
			into service for an interpretation that, none the less, ten per
			<lb />
			cent, of 28 paise is deductible as tax. Perhaps the intention
			<lb />
			might have been to bring the agents within the tax net, but
			<lb />
			the section as it stands, according to me, is not authority for
			<lb />
			taxation at source, as is envisaged by exhibit P-4.&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>
			This decision has been upheld by a Division Bench of Kerala
			<lb />
			High Court and SLP filed against it already stands dismissed.

			(XXVIII) Delhi High Court in Commissioner of Income
			<lb />
			Tax v. Jai Drinks Pvt. Ltd. reported as 2011 (336) ITR
			<lb />
			383 (Del.) expressed similar view and observed as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;3. A survey was conducted under Section 133A of the Act
			<lb />
			and the assessing officer passed an order holding that the
			<lb />
			payment made by the Assessee to the distributor constituted
			<lb />
			commission under Section 194H of the Act. The assessing
			<lb />
			officer held that the Assessee defaulted in not deducting the
			<lb />
			tax at source on the amount of commission paid to the
			<lb />
			distributor and consequently, determined the total tax
			<lb />
			liability of Rs.40,06,679/-under Section 201(1) &amp; 201 (1A)
			<lb />
			of the Act.
			<lb />
			Assessee preferred an appeal before the
			<lb />
			Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (hereinafter referred
			<lb />
			to as Commissioner (Appeals) which was allowed.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			Commissioner (Appeals) held the payments made by the
			<lb />
			Assessee as incentives in the normal course of buying and
			<lb />
			selling. The revenue preferred an appeal against this order
			<lb />
			before the ITAT which was dismissed holding that the nature
			<lb />
			of transaction between the Assessee and the distributor is
			<lb />
			not that of principal-agent, but principal-to-principal and that
			<lb />
			the payment given by Assessee to the distributor is nothing
			<lb />
			but a discount and did not have the characteristics of
			<lb />
			commission.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			9.
			<lb />
			From all that has been noted above, it is evident that
			<lb />
			the distributor was to purchase products at pre-determined
			<lb />
			price from the Assessee for selling the same within specified
			<lb />
			area. The products were to be purchased by the distributor
			<lb />
			against 100% advance payment or may be some times on
			<lb />
			credit at the discretion of the Assessee. Both the Assessee
			<lb />
			and the distributor have been collecting and paying their
			<lb />
			sales tax separately.
			<lb />
			Both the parties have clearly
			<lb />
			understood and accepted the agreement between them.
			<lb />
			That being the arrangement between the Assessee and the
			<lb />
			distributor, it could not be said that the relation between
			<lb />
			them was that of principal-agent. On the other hand it was
			<lb />
			clearly stipulated to be an agreement between them on
			<lb />
			principal-to-principal basis.
			<lb />
			Both the Commissioner
			<lb />
			(Appeals) and also the ITAT rightly held that the payments
			<lb />
			being made by the Assessee to the distributor were
			<lb />
			incentives and discounts and not commissions. We find no
			<lb />
			infirmity in the findings of the Commissioner (Appeals) and
			<lb />
			also ITAT.&quot;

		<p>
			(XXXI) On a conjoint reading of Sections 66, 67 and Rule
			<lb />
			7(C) it appears that the service tax payable by a service
			<lb />
			provider for promotion, marketing, organizing or in any
			<lb />
			manner assisting in organizing lottery is @ 12% or assessed
			<lb />
			in the manner indicated in the table above on the value of
			<lb />
			the service provided or to be provided. In respect of the
			<lb />
			online lotteries the aggregate value of the lottery ticket is to
			<lb />
			be taken as the value of the service on which service tax is
			<lb />
			payable. In respect to the paper lottery also the same mode
			<lb />
			has been adopted and gross value of the lottery ticket has
			<lb />
			been taken as the valuation for the purpose of levy of
			<lb />
			service tax. During the course of argument, Mr. Razzak
			<lb />
			after seeking instructions admitted that the service tax is
			<lb />
			being charged at the gross value of the lottery ticket i.e.
			<lb />
			Re.1/-or in the manner prescribed in the Rule 7(C) as
			<lb />
			introduced vide Notification dated 8 th October, 2010. It is
			<lb />
			relevant to note that according to Mr. Razzak&apos;s submission
			<lb />
			the 30% discount allowed by the State Government to the
			<lb />
			petitioners is for rendering service, whereas admittedly 70
			<lb />
			paise is the price of the lottery ticket.
			<lb />
			According to
			<lb />
			respondents own case only 30% of the gross value can be
			<lb />
			taken as the valuation for providing service if at all the
			<lb />
			activity of petitioners is to be construed as a service falling
			<lb />
			within the definition of &quot;taxable service&quot;.
			<lb />
			The Ministry of
			<lb />
			Finance (Department of Revenue), Central Board of Excise
			<lb />
			and Customs, Government of India has also issued a
			<lb />
			clarificatory circular dated 10.11.2006 laying down the
			<lb />
			criterion for levy of service tax. The relevant extract is
			<lb />
			reproduced hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;4. To levy service tax, the following criteria are to be
			<lb />
			satisfied:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			.
			<lb />
		</item>
		The service provided or to be provided satisfies
		<lb />
		the definition of taxable service.
		<lb />
		.
		<lb />

		<item>
			There should be receipt of consideration for the
			<lb />
			taxable service provided.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(XXXII) In view of the above clarification, it is pleaded on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioners that receipt of consideration for
			<lb />
			providing &quot;taxable service&quot; is one of the essential ingredients
			<lb />
			to establish that any service is a &quot;taxable service&quot;. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that in the instant case, the Government does not
			<lb />
			pay any consideration in any form for the activities to be
			<lb />
			performed by the petitioner for promotion of the sale by
			<lb />
			advertisement etc. To the contrary, the petitioner is paying
			<lb />
			the minimum guaranteed sum towards the full sale
			<lb />
			consideration to the Government and thus the entire claim
			<lb />
			of the respondents that the petitioner is providing taxable
			<lb />
			service is belied by its own circular and understanding of the
			<lb />
			nature of the petitioner&apos;s activity.

			<lb />
			We would like to deal with each limb of Ground-B
			<lb />
			separately.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) whether the conduct of lottery is an Act of &quot;Betting
			<lb />
			and Gambling&quot; envisaged under entries 34 and 62
			<lb />
			of List II to Schedule 7
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(a)
			<lb />
			&quot;Lottery&quot; has been defined under Section 2(b) of
			<lb />
			the regulatory Act of 1998, which reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(b) &quot;lottery&quot; means a scheme, in whatever form and by
			<lb />
			whatever name called, for distribution of prizes by
			<lb />
			lot or chance to those persons participating in the
			<lb />
			chances of a prize by purchasing tickets;&quot;
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			From the above definition, it transpires that lottery is a
			<lb />
			game of chance of those persons who participate in the
			<lb />
			chances of a prize by purchasing tickets. The expressions
			<lb />
			&quot;betting and gambling&quot; have been defined in the Black&apos;s Law
			<lb />
			Dictionary separately in the following manner: -
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;betting -A system of gambling in which bets placed on
			<lb />
			a race are pooled and then paid to those holding winning
			<lb />
			tickets.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;gambling -The act of risking something of value, esp.
			<lb />
			money, for a chance to win a prize.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Above definitions include any act by which a person
			<lb />
			participates in a game of chances by risking money for
			<lb />
			purchase of ticket to win a prize. From these definitions and
			<lb />
			the definition of lottery under the regulatory Act, it is
			<lb />
			apparent that lottery is also a game of chance where a
			<lb />
			ticket-holder risks his money to win a prize on a chance.
			<lb />
			Section 294A of the IPC punishes a person who keeps any
			<lb />
			office or place for the purpose of drawing any lottery or even
			<lb />
			the proposal to pay any money or to deliver any goods on
			<lb />
			any event or contingency of any ticket or any figure in the
			<lb />
			lottery as an offence except where it is run or authorized by
			<lb />
			the State Government. The lottery, per se, does fall within
			<lb />
			the expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot; which Act is
			<lb />
			pernicious in nature. It gets a legal umbrella only if it is run
			<lb />
			or authorized by the State Govt. subject to the conditions
			<lb />
			enumerated under Section 4 of the Lotteries (Regulation)
			<lb />
			Act, 1998. It is a privilege of the State which can be
			<lb />
			partially parted to any other person subject to the
			<lb />
			performance of statutory conditions contained in the
			<lb />
			regulatory Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(b)
			<lb />
			Lottery has been declared to be falling within the
			<lb />
			expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot; by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in B. R. Enterprises v. State of U.P. &amp; Ors. :
			<lb />
			(1999) 9 SCC 700. The relevant observations are quoted
			<lb />
			hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 64. For this, we revert to scrutinize as to what made
			<lb />
			lotteries gambling and how State lotteries cleanses this
			<lb />
			character. As we have already recorded, the difference
			<lb />
			between gambling and trade is that gambling inherently
			<lb />
			contains a chance with no skill, while trade contains skill
			<lb />
			with no chance. What makes lottery pernicious is its
			<lb />
			gambling nature.
			<lb />
			Can it be said that in the State-
			<lb />
			organised lotteries this element of gambling is excluded?
			<lb />
			There could possibly be no two opinions that even in the
			<lb />
			State lotteries the same element of chance remains with
			<lb />
			no skill. It remains within the boundaries of gambling.
			<lb />
			The stringent measures and the conditions imposed under
			<lb />
			the State lotteries are only to inculcate faith in the
			<lb />
			participant of such lottery, that it is being conducted fairly
			<lb />
			with no possibility of fraud, misappropriation or deceit
			<lb />
			and assure the hopeful recipients of high prizes that all is
			<lb />
			fair and safe. That assurance if from stage one to the last
			<lb />
			with full transparency. No doubt, holding of the State
			<lb />
			lotteries for public revenue has been authorised, legalised
			<lb />
			and once this having been done it is expected from the
			<lb />
			State to take such measure to see that people at large,
			<lb />
			faithfully and hopefully participate in larger number for
			<lb />
			the greater yield of its revenue with no fear in their mind.
			<lb />
			The Act further ensures by virtue of Section 4(d) that the
			<lb />
			proceeds of the sale of such lottery tickets is credited to
			<lb />
			the public accounts of the State. This is to give clear
			<lb />
			message to the participants that the proceeds are not in
			<lb />
			the hands of an individual group or association but is
			<lb />
			ensured to be credited in the State accounts. But, as we
			<lb />
			have said, this by itself would not take it outside the
			<lb />
			realm of gambling. It remains within the same realm. In
			<lb />
			this regard, there is no difference between lotteries under
			<lb />
			Entry 34 List II and a lottery organised by the State
			<lb />
			under Entry 40 List I. when character of both the State-
			<lb />
			organised lotteries and other lotteries remains the same,
			<lb />
			by merely placing the apparel of the State with authority
			<lb />
			of law, would not make any difference; it remains
			<lb />
			gambling as element of chance persists with no element
			<lb />
			of skill. ……………….. &quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(c)
			<lb />
			A similar view has been expressed by the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in case of Union of India &amp; Ors. v. Martin
			<lb />
			Lottery Agencies Limited : (2009) 12 SCC 209. The
			<lb />
			relevant observations are reproduced hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 17. We fail to persuade ourselves to agree with the
			<lb />
			aforementioned submission. The law, as it stands today
			<lb />
			(although it is possible that this Court in future may take
			<lb />
			a different view), recognises lottery to be gambling.
			<lb />
			Gambling is res extra commercium as has been held by
			<lb />
			this Court in State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala
			<lb />
			and B.R. Enterprises v. State of U.P.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Thus, in view of the clear and categorical opinion of the Apex
			<lb />
			Court, we have no hesitation in concluding that the conduct
			<lb />
			of lottery is an act of &quot;betting and gambling&quot; envisaged
			<lb />
			under entries 34 and 62 of List II to Schedule 7.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) whether it is within the exclusive domain of State
			<lb />
			legislature to impose taxes on organising lotteries
			<lb />
			being an act of &quot;Betting and Gambling&quot;
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			(iii) whether the Parliament has the competence to
			<lb />
			enact law in exercise of its residuary legislative
			<lb />
			power under entry 97 of List I to Schedule 7
			<lb />
			dehors the entries 34 and 62 of List II;
			<lb />
			Since both these limbs are interrelated, the same are being
			<lb />
			taken up for consideration conjointly.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(d)
			<lb />
			Entry 34 of List II to Schedule 7 prescribes
			<lb />
			&quot;Betting and Gambling&quot; as a field of legislation within the
			<lb />
			domain of the State.
			<lb />
			Entry 40 also provides lotteries
			<lb />
			organized by the Government of India or the Government of
			<lb />
			a State as a field of legislation for which the Union
			<lb />
			legislature can enact a law. Entry 34 has much wider field
			<lb />
			and it may include many other activities apart from the
			<lb />
			lotteries for which the State legislature may enact a law.
			<lb />
			However, under entry 40 the Parliament is competent to
			<lb />
			enact law only in respect to lotteries as a species of betting
			<lb />
			and gambling. Lottery thus is a common subject matter for
			<lb />
			which both the Union Parliament and State Legislature can
			<lb />
			enact laws and fall in their respective legislative competence
			<lb />
			under Article 246 of the Constitution of India. The laws to
			<lb />
			be enacted under both these entries, however, could only be
			<lb />
			regulatory in nature and nothing beyond that. Where any
			<lb />
			field of legislation is available to both the Parliament and the
			<lb />
			legislature of a State and both the legislative bodies enact
			<lb />
			laws having competence to do so, in the event of conflict the
			<lb />
			State law to the extent of repugnancy shall be void if such
			<lb />
			law is enacted pursuant to any entry under List III
			<lb />
			(Concurrent List).
			<lb />
			However, the situation where the
			<lb />
			Parliament enacts a law on the subject matter under any
			<lb />
			one of the entries in List I and the State legislature also
			<lb />
			enacts a law touching the same subject matter pursuant to
			<lb />
			an entry in List II or vice versa, the position would be
			<lb />
			different. This seems to be the spirit underlying Article 246
			<lb />
			read with Article 254 of the Constitution of India subject to
			<lb />
			exceptions under various Articles in Part XI Chapter I. This
			<lb />
			should not detain us as admittedly the Parliament alone has
			<lb />
			enacted the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998 under entry 40
			<lb />
			and there is no corresponding law enacted by the State
			<lb />
			legislature under entry 34 in respect to the regulation of the
			<lb />
			lotteries. As noticed above power to regulate does not
			<lb />
			include power to tax, taxing powers having been conferred
			<lb />
			and specified under separate entries in Seventh Schedule.
			<lb />

		<p>
			(e)
			<lb />
			In case of State of West Bengal &amp; Ors. v. Purvi
			<lb />
			Communication (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors. : (2005) 3 SCC 711, it
			<lb />
			has been held by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court that the power
			<lb />
			to regulate does not include power to tax. The relevant
			<lb />
			observations are noticed hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 35. The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act,
			<lb />
			1995, a Central legislation, has been enacted to regulate
			<lb />
			the operation of cable television networks in the country
			<lb />
			and for matters connected therewith. This enactment
			<lb />
			does not, in our opinion, fetter the legislative power or
			<lb />
			competence of the State to levy tax on luxuries including
			<lb />
			taxes on entertainments, amusements, betting and
			<lb />
			gambling falling under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule to the Constitution. The power of regulation or
			<lb />
			control under the said Central enactment is separate and
			<lb />
			distinct from the power of taxation by the State
			<lb />
			Legislature under Entry 62 of List II; being a specific
			<lb />
			power, the power of taxation cannot be cut down or
			<lb />
			fettered by the general power of regulation as exercised
			<lb />
			by Parliament in enacting the said 1995 Act. …………..
			<lb />
			…..……………………………………………………………………………………&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(f)
			<lb />
			Indubitably, there is no specific entry under List I
			<lb />
			empowering the Parliament to levy tax on lotteries or even
			<lb />
			on &quot;betting and gambling&quot;. The service tax sought to be
			<lb />
			imposed is in exercise of the residuary power vested in the
			<lb />
			Parliament under entry 97 of List I read with Article 248 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution of India. In so far the List II is concerned,
			<lb />
			entry 62 specifically provides for levy of taxes on &quot;betting
			<lb />
			and gambling&quot;. As observed by us above and held by
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in B.R. Enterprises and Martin
			<lb />
			Lottery Agencies Ltd. (supra), lottery does fall within the
			<lb />
			expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot;. The first question for
			<lb />
			consideration would be whether the power to impose tax on
			<lb />
			lotteries is same thing as to impose tax on &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;. Though no entry in any of the Lists to Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule specifically provides for levy of taxes on lotteries,
			<lb />
			the power to enact law for imposition of tax on lotteries have
			<lb />
			to be construed as inherent in the expressions &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;, lottery being one of such activity.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(g)
			<lb />
			Entry 97 of List I authorizes the Parliament to
			<lb />
			enact a law including imposition of taxes in respect of any
			<lb />
			other matter not enumerated in List II or List III. Article
			<lb />
			248, which is the source of power, confers exclusive
			<lb />
			jurisdiction upon the Parliament to make any law in respect
			<lb />
			of any matter not enumerated in &quot;State List&quot; or &quot;Concurrent
			<lb />
			List&quot; and under Sub-clause (2). Such power also includes
			<lb />
			power to make law for imposition of tax not mentioned in
			<lb />
			either of those Lists, i.e. Lists II and III respectively.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(h)
			<lb />
			The scope of legislative competence of the
			<lb />
			Parliament to make laws under entry 97 of List I came up for
			<lb />
			consideration before a Constitution Bench of the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Union of India v. Shri Harbhajan
			<lb />
			Singh Dhillon : 1971 (2) SCC 779. In this case, vires of
			<lb />
			the Section 27 of the Finance Act, 1969, in so far as it
			<lb />
			amended the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 to include the capital
			<lb />
			value of the agricultural land for the purposes of commuting
			<lb />
			wealth, came to be challenged as being beyond the
			<lb />
			exclusive competence of the Parliament. The petitioners,
			<lb />
			who challenged the vires of the Act, claimed that the power
			<lb />
			to tax on agricultural land was within the exclusive
			<lb />
			competence of the State Legislature under entry 49 of List II
			<lb />
			-i.e. Taxes on lands and buildings. It was held by the High
			<lb />
			Court and approved by the Apex Court that the power to
			<lb />
			levy tax on agricultural land is not contemplated by entry
			<lb />
			49, List II. However, the amended Act was struck down by
			<lb />
			the High Court being beyond the competence of the
			<lb />
			Parliament by interpreting entry 86 of List I whereunder
			<lb />
			agricultural land was excluded from capital value of the
			<lb />
			assets. The amendment brought by the Finance Act was
			<lb />
			claimed to be under the residuary power under entry 97, List
			<lb />
			I. While considering this question, the Constitution Bench of
			<lb />
			the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;10. It was further urged by Mr. Setalvad that the
			<lb />
			proper way of testing the validity of a parliamentary
			<lb />
			statute under our Constitution was first to see whether
			<lb />
			the parliamentary legislation was with respect to a matter
			<lb />
			or tax mentioned in List II, if it was not, no other question
			<lb />
			would arise. The learned counsel for the respondent
			<lb />
			contended tha this manner of enquiry had not been even
			<lb />
			hinted in any of the decisions of the Court during the last
			<lb />
			20 years of its existence and there must accordingly be
			<lb />
			something wrong with this test. He urged that in so far
			<lb />
			as this test is derived from the Canadian decisions, the
			<lb />
			Canadian Constitution is very different and those
			<lb />
			decisions ought not to be followed here and applied to our
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			11. It seems to us that the best way of dealing with the
			<lb />
			question of the validity of the impugned Act with the
			<lb />
			contentions of the parties is to ask ourselves two
			<lb />
			questions first is the impugned Act legislation with respect
			<lb />
			to Entry 49, List II and secondly if it is not, is it beyond
			<lb />
			the legislative competence of Parliament.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			12. We have put these questions in this order and in
			<lb />
			this form because we are definitely of the opinion, as
			<lb />
			explained a little later, that the scheme of our
			<lb />
			Constitution and the actual terms of the relevant
			<lb />
			articles, namely, Article 246, Article 248 and Entry 97,
			<lb />
			List I, show that any matter, including tax, which has
			<lb />
			not been allotted exclusively to the State Legislatures
			<lb />
			under List II or concurrently with Parliament under List
			<lb />
			III, falls within List I, including Entry 97 of that list
			<lb />
			read with Article 248.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………………………….
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			21. It seems to us that the function of Article
			<lb />
			246(1), read with Entries 1-96, List I, is to give
			<lb />
			positive power to Parliament to legislate in respect of
			<lb />
			these entries. Object is not to debar Parliament from
			<lb />
			legislating on a matter, even if other provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution enable it to do so. Accordingly we do not
			<lb />
			interpret the words &quot;any other matter&quot; occurring in
			<lb />
			Entry 97, List I, to mean a topic mentioned by way of
			<lb />
			exclusion. These words really refer to the matters
			<lb />
			contained in each of the Entries 1 to 96. The words
			<lb />
			&quot;any other matter&quot; had to be used because Entry 97,
			<lb />
			List I follows Entries 1-96, List I. It is true that the
			<lb />
			field of legislation is demarcated by Entries 1-96, List
			<lb />
			I, but demarcation does not mean that if Entry 97, List
			<lb />
			I confers, additional powers, we should refuse to give
			<lb />
			effect to it. At any rate, whatever doubt there may be
			<lb />
			on the interpretation of Entry 97, List I is removed by
			<lb />
			the wide terms of Article 248. It is framed in the
			<lb />
			widest possible terms. On its terms the only question
			<lb />
			to be asked is : Is the matter sought to be legislated
			<lb />
			or included in List II or in List III or is the tax sought
			<lb />
			to be levied mentioned in List II or in List III : No
			<lb />
			question has to be asked about List I. If the answer is
			<lb />
			in the negative then it follows that Parliament has
			<lb />
			power to make laws with respect to that matter of tax.

			47. The last sentence applies much more to the
			<lb />
			Constitution of a sovereign democratic republic. It is
			<lb />
			true that there are some limitations in Part III of the
			<lb />
			Constitution on the Legislatures in India but they are
			<lb />
			of a different character. They have nothing to do with
			<lb />
			legislative competence. If this is the true scope of
			<lb />
			residuary powers of Parliament, then we are unable to
			<lb />
			see why we should not, when dealing with a Central
			<lb />
			Act, enquire whether it is legislation in respect of any
			<lb />
			matter in List II for this is the only field regarding
			<lb />
			which there is a prohibition against Parliament. If a
			<lb />
			Central Act does not enter or invade these prohibited
			<lb />
			fields there is no point in trying to decide as to under
			<lb />
			which entry or entries of List I or List III a Central Act
			<lb />
			would rightly fit in.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			67. ………………………………. Be that as it may, we have
			<lb />
			the three lists and a residuary power and therefore it
			<lb />
			seems to us that in this context if a Central Act is
			<lb />
			challenged as being beyond the legislative competence
			<lb />
			of Parliament, it is enough to enquire if it is a law with
			<lb />
			respect to matters or taxes enumerated in List II. If it
			<lb />
			is not, no further question arises.
			<lb />

		<item>
			103. The expression &quot;any matter not enumerated in
			<lb />
			the Concurrent List or State List&quot; in Article 248 must
			<lb />
			mean, in the context of clause (1) of Article 246,
			<lb />
			which gives Parliament exclusive power in respect of
			<lb />
			matters in List I, any matter other than those
			<lb />
			enumerated in any of the three Lists. Obviously, the
			<lb />
			residuary power given to Parliament in Article 248
			<lb />
			cannot include power which is exclusively given to
			<lb />
			Parliament on matters in List I already conferred under
			<lb />
			clause (1) of Article 246, so that an attempt to
			<lb />
			distinguish the words &quot;any matter&quot; in Article 248 and
			<lb />
			&quot;any other matter&quot; in Entry 97 in List I is a distinction
			<lb />
			without difference. There had to be difference in
			<lb />
			language in the provisions in the context of the
			<lb />
			content of Entry 97 as that entry speaks about
			<lb />
			matters other than those enumerated before in List I
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			those
			<lb />
			enumerated
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			other
			<lb />
			Lists.
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding the fact that the residuary power has
			<lb />
			been vested in the Central Legislature under Article
			<lb />
			248 and its consequence translated in Entry 97 in List
			<lb />
			I, there can be no gainsaying that the idea was to
			<lb />
			assign such residuary power over matters which at the
			<lb />
			time of framing three Lists could not be thought of or
			<lb />
			contemplated. This is clear from the fact as pointed
			<lb />
			out by counsel, that the Lists contain as many as 209
			<lb />
			matters which are couched in careful and elaborate
			<lb />
			words with inclusive and excluding language in the
			<lb />
			case of some, which has made the Constitution, to use
			<lb />
			the words of Gwyer, C.J., in In re the C. P. and Berar
			<lb />
			Act No.XIV of 1938 (supra), &quot;unique among federal
			<lb />
			constitutions in the length and detail of its legislative
			<lb />

			<lb />
			In the layout of such elaborately worded
			<lb />
			matters in the Lists and in the context of Article
			<lb />
			246(1), the residuary power contained in Article 248
			<lb />
			and Entry 97, List I must be construed as meaning
			<lb />
			power in respect of matters not enumerated in any of
			<lb />
			the three Lists.
			<lb />
			Such a residuary power cannot,
			<lb />
			therefore, be ordinarily claimed in respect of a matter

			Another Constitution Bench of the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries
			<lb />
			Ltd. &amp; Ors. : (2004) 10 SCC 201 again examined the
			<lb />
			scope of entry 97 List I and Article 248 to levy tax under the
			<lb />
			residuary power. The relevant observations are quoted as
			<lb />
			under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 100.
			<lb />
			Article 265 mandates -no tax shall be
			<lb />
			levied or collected except by authority of law. The
			<lb />
			scheme of the Seventh Schedule reveals an
			<lb />
			exhaustive enumeration of legislative subjects,
			<lb />
			considerably
			<lb />
			enlarged
			<lb />
			over
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			predecessor
			<lb />
			Government of India Act. Entry 97 in List I confers
			<lb />
			residuary powers on Parliament. Article 248 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution which speaks of residuary powers of
			<lb />
			legislation confers exclusive power on Parliament to
			<lb />
			make any law with respect to any matter not
			<lb />
			enumerated in the Concurrent List or the State List.
			<lb />
			At the same time, it provides that such residuary
			<lb />
			power shall include the power to making any law
			<lb />
			imposing a tax not mentioned in either of those Lists.
			<lb />
			It is, thus, clear that if any power to tax is clearly
			<lb />
			mentioned in List II, the same would not be available
			<lb />
			to be exercised by Parliament based on the
			<lb />
			assumption of residuary power.&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>
			(j)
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Bench relied upon the Constitution Bench
			<lb />

			&quot; 102. Vide para 22.194 the eminent jurist poses a
			<lb />
			question:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;22.194.
			<lb />
			Does Article 248 add anything
			<lb />
			to the exclusive residuary power of Parliament
			<lb />
			under Article 246(1) read with Entry 97 List I, to
			<lb />
			make laws in respect of &apos;any other matter&apos; not
			<lb />
			mentioned in List II and List III, including any tax
			<lb />
			not mentioned in those Lists?&quot;
			<lb />
			and answers by saying -&quot;The answer is &apos;No&apos;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(k)
			<lb />
			The Hon&apos;ble Court further observed that there is
			<lb />
			nothing like an implied power to tax and the burden is
			<lb />
			always upon the taxing authority to point to the act of
			<lb />
			assembly which authorizes the imposition of the tax claimed.
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Court further relied upon Justice G.P. Singh&apos;s
			<lb />
			commentary on Principles of Statutory Interpretation (8 th
			<lb />
			Edn., 2001).
			<lb />
			The relevant quotes are reproduced
			<lb />
			hereunder: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;106. The judicial opinion of binding authority flowing
			<lb />
			from several pronouncements of this Court has settled
			<lb />
			these principles : (i) in interpreting a taxing statute,
			<lb />
			equitable considerations are entirely out of place. Taxing
			<lb />
			statutes cannot be interpreted on any presumption or
			<lb />
			assumption. A taxing statute has to be interpreted in the
			<lb />
			light of what is clearly expressed; it cannot imply
			<lb />
			anything which is not expressed; it cannot import
			<lb />
			provisions in the statute so as to supply any deficiency;
			<lb />
			(ii) before taxing any person it must be shown that he
			<lb />
			falls within the ambit of the charging section by clear
			<lb />
			words used in the section; and (iii) if the words are
			<lb />
			ambiguous and open to two interpretations, the benefit of
			<lb />
			interpretation is given to the subject. There is nothing
			<lb />
			unjust in the taxpayer escaping if the letter of the law
			<lb />
			fails to catch him on account of the legislature&apos;s failure to
			<lb />
			express itself clearly. (See Justice G. P. Singh, ibid., pp.
			<lb />
			638-39.)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			107. Power to tax is not an incidental power. According
			<lb />
			to Seervai, although legislative power includes all
			<lb />
			incidental and subsidiary power, the power to impose a
			<lb />
			tax is not such a power under our Constitution. It is for
			<lb />
			this reason that it was held that the power to legislate in
			<lb />
			respect to inter-State trade and commerce (Entry 42 List
			<lb />
			I Schedule 7) did not carry with it the power to tax the
			<lb />
			sale of goods in inter-State trade and commerce before
			<lb />
			the insertion of Entry 92-A in List I and such power
			<lb />
			belonged to the States under Entry 54 in List II. Entry 97
			<lb />
			in List I also militated against the contention that the
			<lb />
			power to tax is an incidental power under our Constitution
			<lb />
			(See Seervai, H.M. : Constitutional Law of India, 4 th /Silver
			<lb />
			Jubilee Edn., Vol. 3, para 22.20.)&quot;

			In N. V. Marketing Pvt. Ltd. v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra &amp; Ors. : 2009 (III) (8) Bom. L.R. 3397, it
			<lb />
			has been ruled that even though the power of regulation of
			<lb />
			lotteries vest in the Parliament in terms of entry 40 of List I,
			<lb />
			power to tax is not an incidental power.
			<lb />
			The Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Bombay High Court relying upon West Bengal v. Kesoram
			<lb />
			Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. : (2004) 10 SCC 201 and various
			<lb />
			other judgments, while considering the validity of State law
			<lb />
			enacted by the Maharashtra State imposing tax on lotteries,
			<lb />
			observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;3. It is the contention of the Petitioners that the
			<lb />
			legislature of State of Maharashtra has no legislative
			<lb />
			power to enact Laws relating to State Lotteries including
			<lb />
			Laws relating to taxation, and therefore, according to the
			<lb />
			Petitioners, the State Act is beyond the legislative
			<lb />
			competence of the legislature of State of Maharashtra.
			<lb />
			The second submission is that the enactment of the State
			<lb />
			Act is colourable exercise of the legislative power in as
			<lb />
			much as it is another method of levying tax on lottery
			<lb />
			tickets. The third submission is that the State Act seeks
			<lb />
			to levy tax on lottery schemes, tax is collected in advance
			<lb />
			in respect of each draw in the lottery scheme at the rate
			<lb />
			specified in Section 3 of the State Act. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that lottery scheme of all other State organising and
			<lb />
			conducting lotteries save and except that of Maharashtra
			<lb />
			are formulated outside the State of Maharashtra and
			<lb />
			therefore, the law has extra territorial application. The
			<lb />
			fourth submission is that the State Act levies tax on
			<lb />
			lottery schemes but the term &quot;lottery scheme&quot; is not
			<lb />
			defined anywhere and therefore, it is violative of
			<lb />
			guarantee under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It
			<lb />
			was also contended that the State Act has been enacted
			<lb />
			to impose tax on sale of lottery tickets conducted by
			<lb />
			other State in State of Maharashtra so as to make selling
			<lb />
			of lottery tickets by the other States uneconomical,
			<lb />
			unviable and thereby creating monopoly in the lottery
			<lb />
			tickets of the lotteries conducted by the State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra.

			10. It was then contended before us that though there
			<lb />
			is specific power vested in the State legislature under
			<lb />
			Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule, because of
			<lb />
			Entry 40 in List I of the Seventh Schedule of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India, the Parliament will have legislative
			<lb />
			competence to levy tax under Article 248 and Entry 97 in
			<lb />
			List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of
			<lb />
			India. In our opinion, this submission has also no force,
			<lb />
			because power to tax is not an incidental power and
			<lb />
			under the residuary power the Parliament will be entitled
			<lb />
			to impose tax only if that power is not specifically vested
			<lb />
			in the State legislature by any entry in List II of the
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule. ……..&quot;

			In Godfrey Philips India Ltd. v. State of U.P. :
			<lb />
			(2005) 2 SCC 515, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court upholding
			<lb />
			the legislative power of State under entry 62 of List II, held
			<lb />
			as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;46. Therefore, taxing entries must be construed with
			<lb />
			clarity and precision so as to maintain such exclusivity,
			<lb />
			and a construction of a taxation entry which may lead to
			<lb />
			overlapping must be eschewed. If the taxing power is
			<lb />
			within a particular legislative field, it would follow that
			<lb />
			other fields in the legislative lists must be construed to
			<lb />
			exclude this field so that there is no possibility of
			<lb />
			legislative trespass.

			49. Under the three lists of the Seventh Schedule to
			<lb />
			the Indian Constitution a taxation entry in a legislative list
			<lb />
			may be with respect to both. Article 246 makes it clear
			<lb />
			that the exclusive powers conferred on Parliament or the
			<lb />
			States to legislate on a particular matter includes the
			<lb />
			power to legislate with respect to that matter. Hence,
			<lb />
			where the entry describes an object to tax, all taxable
			<lb />
			events pertaining to the object are within that field of
			<lb />
			legislation unless the even is specifically provided for
			<lb />
			elsewhere under a different legislative head. Where there
			<lb />
			is the possibility of legislative overlap, courts have
			<lb />
			resolved the issue according to settled principles of
			<lb />
			construction of entries in the legislative lists.

			72. In view of the decision in Sea Customs Act case
			<lb />
			the second premise propounded by Mr. Salve is
			<lb />
			unacceptable. As we have seen, in that case this
			<lb />
			Court held that the taxable event of ownership is
			<lb />
			implicit in the concept of taxes on goods. That the
			<lb />
			entries on taxable events in the legislative lists are not
			<lb />
			exhaustive is also recognized and provided for in
			<lb />
			Article 248(2) which provides for the power of
			<lb />
			Parliament to make any law imposing a tax not
			<lb />
			mentioned in either the Concurrent or State Lists.
			<lb />
			This residuary power is reflected in Entry 97 of List I.
			<lb />
			Furthermore if an article or goods are taxable only
			<lb />
			with respect to a taxable event, and if, as contended
			<lb />
			by Mr. Salve, all taxable events have been provided
			<lb />
			for in the different legislative heads, then by that
			<lb />
			token no object or goods could be taxable. This would
			<lb />
			render the various entries in the State List including
			<lb />
			Entries 57 and 58 contentless. As we cannot accept
			<lb />
			that the taxation entries exhaustively enumerate all
			<lb />
			taxable events, it does not follow that Entry 62 of List
			<lb />
			II does not cover goods. It is not possible therefore to
			<lb />
			hold merely on such a construction of the legislative
			<lb />
			lists and the taxation entries therein, that Entry 62 List
			<lb />
			II does not permit the States to levy tax on articles of
			<lb />
			luxury.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			73. Having rejected the second premise
			<lb />
			contended for by Mr. Salve, the next question is
			<lb />
			whether the language of Entry 62 List II would resolve
			<lb />
			the issue. The juxtaposition of the different taxes
			<lb />
			within Entry 62 itself is in our view of particular
			<lb />
			significance. The entry speaks of &quot;taxes on luxuries
			<lb />
			including taxes on entertainments, amusements,
			<lb />
			betting and gambling&quot;. The word &quot;including must be
			<lb />
			given some meaning. In ordinary parlance it indicates
			<lb />
			that what follows the word &quot;including&quot; comprises or is
			<lb />
			contained in or is a part of the whole of the work
			<lb />
			preceding. The nature of the included items would not
			<lb />
			only partake of the character of the whole, but may be
			<lb />
			construed as clarificatory of the whole.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			74. It has also been held that the word
			<lb />
			&quot;includes&quot; may in certain contexts be a word of
			<lb />
			limitation (South Gujarat Roofing Tiles Manufacturers
			<lb />
			Assn. v. State of Gujarat). In the context of Entry 62
			<lb />
			of List II this would not mean that the word &quot;luxuries&quot;
			<lb />
			would be restricted to entertainments, amusements,
			<lb />
			betting and gambling but would only emphasise the
			<lb />
			attribute which is common to the group. If luxuries is
			<lb />
			understood as meaning something which is purely for
			<lb />
			enjoyment and beyond the necessities of life, there
			<lb />
			can be no doubt that entertainments, amusements,
			<lb />
			betting and gambling would come within such
			<lb />
			understanding.
			<lb />
			Additionally,
			<lb />
			entertainments,
			<lb />
			amusements, betting and gambling arfe all activities.
			<lb />
			&quot;Luxuries&quot; is also capable of meaning an activity and
			<lb />
			has primarily and traditionally been defined as such.
			<lb />
			It is only derivatively and recently used to connote an
			<lb />
			article of luxury. One can assume that the coupling of
			<lb />
			these taxes under one entry was not fortuitous but
			<lb />
			because of these common characteristics.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(n)
			<lb />
			It has been vehemently argued by Mr. Razzaq that
			<lb />
			the service tax levied vide clause (zzzzn) under sub-section
			<lb />
			(105) of Section 65 is a tax on various activities comprising
			<lb />
			services rendered by the distributors to the State in
			<lb />
			promotion, marketing, organizing of lottery, etc. It is not a
			<lb />
			tax on betting and gambling, per se and is beyond the
			<lb />
			purview of entry 62 of List II.
			<lb />
			Entry 62 empowers the State Legislature to impose tax
			<lb />
			on luxuries, entertainment, amusement, betting and
			<lb />
			gambling.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(o)
			<lb />
			For the purpose of the present petition, the
			<lb />
			relevant subject matter under entry 62 is &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;.
			<lb />
			As held by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Express Hotels Private Ltd. v. State of Gujarat &amp; Anr. :
			<lb />
			(1989) 3 SCC 677, the entries must be construed by giving
			<lb />
			them the widest possible meaning. Relevant observations
			<lb />
			are:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;15. …………………….The entries should not be read in a
			<lb />
			narrow or pedantic sense but must be given their fullest
			<lb />
			meaning and the widest amplitude and be held to extend
			<lb />
			to all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and
			<lb />
			reasonably be said to be comprehended in them.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			In the same judgment the vires of various provisions
			<lb />
			enacted by States of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and
			<lb />
			West Bengal, imposing taxes on luxuries provided in hotels
			<lb />
			and lodging houses came to be challenged. The question
			<lb />
			that arose in those cases was as to whether the luxury taxes
			<lb />
			can be levied only on the articles of luxury or persons
			<lb />
			enjoying the luxuries under Entry 62 and, the activity of
			<lb />
			lodging in a hotel or lodge being not a thing tangible, the tax
			<lb />
			is ultra vires the Constitution. Interpreting the scope of the
			<lb />
			legislative entry particularly the expression &apos;luxury&apos; used in
			<lb />
			entry 62, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;21. The concept of a tax on &apos;luxuries&apos; in Entry 62, List II
			<lb />
			cannot be limited merely to tax things tangible and corporeal in
			<lb />
			their aspect as &apos;luxuries&apos;. It is true that while frugal or simple
			<lb />
			food and medicine may be classified as necessities; articles
			<lb />
			such as jewellery, perfume, intoxicating liquor, tobacco, etc.,
			<lb />
			could be called articles of luxury. But the legislative entry
			<lb />
			cannot be exhausted by these cases, illustrative of the concept.
			<lb />
			The entry encompasses all the manifestations or emanations,
			<lb />
			the notion of &apos;luxuries&apos; can fairly and reasonably (sic) can be
			<lb />
			said to comprehend the element of extravagance or indulgence
			<lb />
			that differentiates &apos;luxury&apos; from &apos;necessity&apos; cannot be confined
			<lb />
			to goods and articles. There can be elements of extravagance
			<lb />
			or indulgence in the quality of services and activities.&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
			In
			<lb />
			State
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Bombay
			<lb />
			vs.
			<lb />
			R.M.D.
			<lb />
			Chamarbaugwala and another : AIR 1957SC 699, tax
			<lb />
			was levied under entry 62 on the promoters of the lotteries.
			<lb />
			The question that fell for consideration was whether tax on
			<lb />
			promoters of lotteries, who do not gamble is tax on betting
			<lb />
			and gambling under entry 62 List II. Rejecting the challenge
			<lb />
			and upholding the validity of the levy on promoters, the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(23) The next point urged is that although the Act may
			<lb />
			come under Entry 34, the taxing provisions of s. 12A
			<lb />
			cannot be said to impose a tax on betting and gambling
			<lb />
			under Entry 62 but imposes tax on trade under Entry 60.
			<lb />
			Once it is held that the impugned Act is on the topic of
			<lb />
			betting and gambling under Entry 34, the tax imposed by
			<lb />
			such a statute, one would think, would be a tax on
			<lb />
			betting and gambling under Entry 62. The Appeal Court
			<lb />
			has expressed the view that s. 12A does not fall within
			<lb />
			Entry 62, for it does not impose a tax on the gambler but
			<lb />
			imposes a tax on the petitioners who do not themselves
			<lb />
			gamble but who only promote the prize competitions. So
			<lb />
			far as the promoters are concerned, the tax levied from
			<lb />
			them can only be regarded as tax on the trade of prize
			<lb />
			competitions carried on by them.
			<lb />
			This, with respect, is taking a very narrow view of
			<lb />
			the matter. Entry 62 talks of taxes on betting and
			<lb />
			gambling and not of taxes on the men who bet or
			<lb />
			gamble. It is necessary, therefore, to bear in mind the
			<lb />
			real nature of the tax. The tax imposed by s. 12A is, in
			<lb />
			terms, a percentage of the sums specified in the
			<lb />
			declaration made under s. 15 by the promoter or a lump
			<lb />
			sum having regard to the circulation and distribution of
			<lb />
			the news paper or publication in the State.

			If taxation on betting and gambling is to be
			<lb />
			regarded as a means of controlling betting and gambling
			<lb />
			activities, then the easiest and surest way of doing so is
			<lb />
			to get at the promoters who encourage and promote the
			<lb />
			unsocial activities and who hold the gamblers&apos; money in
			<lb />
			their hands. To collect the tax from the promoters is not
			<lb />
			to tax the promoters but is a convenient way of imposing
			<lb />
			the tax on betting and gambling and indirectly taxing the
			<lb />
			gamblers themselves.

			<lb />
			In Purvi Communication (P) Ltd. (supra)
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court considered the scope of Entry 62
			<lb />
			and held that the tax under this Entry may be levied on the
			<lb />
			person spending on entertainment, on the act of person
			<lb />
			entertaining or the subject of entertainment.
			<lb />
			Relevant
			<lb />

			&quot;38. A tax under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Schedule to the Constitution may be imposed not only on
			<lb />
			the person spending on entertainment but also on the act
			<lb />
			of a person entertaining, or the subject of entertainment.
			<lb />
			It is well settled by this Court that such tax may be levied
			<lb />
			on the person offering or providing entertainment or the
			<lb />
			person enjoying it.
			<lb />
			The respondents are admittedly
			<lb />
			engaged in the business of receiving broadcast signals
			<lb />
			and then instantaneously sending or transmitting such
			<lb />
			visual or audio-visual signals by coaxial cable, to
			<lb />
			subscribers&apos; homes through their various franchisees. It
			<lb />
			has been made possible for the individual subscribers to
			<lb />
			choose the desired channels on their individual TV sets
			<lb />
			because of cable television technology of the respondents
			<lb />
			and of sending the visual or audio-viisual signals to sub-
			<lb />
			cable operators, and instantly retransmitting such signals
			<lb />
			to individual subscribers for entertaining them through
			<lb />
			their franchisees. The respondents&apos; act is, no doubt, an
			<lb />
			act of offering entertainment to the subscribers and/or
			<lb />
			viewers.
			<lb />
			The respondent is very much directly and
			<lb />
			closely involved in the act of offering or providing
			<lb />
			entertainment to subscribers who are on his record. For
			<lb />
			the fact of offering or providing entertainment to the
			<lb />
			subscribers and/or viewers, the respondents receive
			<lb />
			charges, which are realized or collected by their
			<lb />
			franchisee from the ultimate subscribers.
			<lb />
			Their
			<lb />
			franchisee, called as sub-cable operator under the said
			<lb />
			1982 Act having no independent role to ofer or provide
			<lb />
			entertainments to
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			subscribers inasmuch as
			<lb />
			franchisees have to depend entirely on the respondents&apos;
			<lb />
			communication network and this communication network
			<lb />
			of the respondents consists of receiving and sending
			<lb />
			visual images and audio and other information for
			<lb />
			preparation of the subscribers and/or viewers; without
			<lb />
			the communication network service of the respondents,
			<lb />
			no entertainments can be offered or provided to the
			<lb />
			subscribers and/or viewers.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			39. In the tax matters, the State Legislature is free, if
			<lb />
			it has legislative competence, to choose the persons from
			<lb />
			whom the tax levied on entertainments is to be collected.
			<lb />
			In other words, what are taxed are the entertainments,
			<lb />
			which is very much within the ambit of Entry 62 of List II
			<lb />
			of the Seventh Schedule. It is the respondents who as
			<lb />
			cable operator for the purpose of the said 1982 Act are
			<lb />
			engaged in the business of providing or offering
			<lb />
			entertainments which include showing of films, various
			<lb />
			serials, cricket matches and dramatic performances to the
			<lb />
			subscribers, and the tax is imposed on the act of offering
			<lb />
			such entertainments in this way to such subscribers
			<lb />
			and/or viewers.
			<lb />
			The entire communication network
			<lb />
			service is built up and controlled by the respondents.
			<lb />
			Whatever amount is received or receivable by the
			<lb />
			respondent in respect of providing such entertainments is
			<lb />
			taxable under sub-section (4-a) of Section 4-A of the said
			<lb />
			1982 Act which has a direct and sufficient nexus with the
			<lb />
			entertainments.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(r)
			<lb />
			Similarly entry 50 under Section 100 of the
			<lb />
			Government of India Act, 1935 relating to tax on luxuries or
			<lb />
			entertainment or amusement has been interpreted by the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in 1959
			<lb />
			Supp (2) SCR 63=AIR 1959 SC 582 : Western India
			<lb />
			Theaters Ltd. vs. Cantonment Board, wherein it has been
			<lb />
			held that &quot;the entries in legislative list should not be read in
			<lb />
			a narrow or restricted sense and that each general word
			<lb />
			should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary
			<lb />
			matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be
			<lb />
			comprehended in it.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(s)
			<lb />
			In the matter of organizing, marketing and
			<lb />
			promotion of lotteries, the State Government who is the
			<lb />
			promoter and publisher of the lotteries, the distributor, i.e.
			<lb />
			the petitioner, selling agent and the ultimate purchaser of
			<lb />
			the lottery ticket who participates in the game of chance,
			<lb />
			are all players in the activity of the betting and gambling.
			<lb />
			Thus tax envisaged under entry 62 on &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot; is tax on the activity as held by the Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			State
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Bombay
			<lb />
			vs.
			<lb />
			R.M.D.
			<lb />
			Chamarbaugwala&apos;s case (supra).
			<lb />
			The betting and
			<lb />
			gambling itself is an activity though the lottery ticket is a
			<lb />
			tangible thing which carries with its right to participate in the
			<lb />
			game of chance. Thus all activities right from the publishing
			<lb />
			of the lottery tickets till participation in the game of chance,
			<lb />
			declaration of draw and even distribution of prize to the
			<lb />
			winner fall within the purview of expression &apos;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&apos;.
			<lb />
			Thus power to levy tax on organization,
			<lb />
			promotion and marketing of lottery being an act of betting
			<lb />
			and gambling comes within the exclusive domain of entry 62
			<lb />
			of List II.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(t)
			<lb />
			It is also settled legal position that where the
			<lb />
			entries under different Lists empower the respective
			<lb />
			legislatures to enact law on any subject matter and the
			<lb />
			question arises regarding the legislative competence of the
			<lb />
			legislative bodies, the doctrine of pith and substance is to be
			<lb />
			applied to find out the real intention of the legislative entry
			<lb />
			and the object of enacting a law. As observed in State of
			<lb />
			West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (supra) if any
			<lb />
			law enacted by Parliament is not traceable to any legislative
			<lb />
			entry in List II or List III, it is irrelevant whether the power
			<lb />
			of the Parliament is traceable to a specific entry and
			<lb />
			Parliament shall be deemed to have legislative competence.
			<lb />
			Its natural corollary would be if power to enact law on a
			<lb />
			subject matter including levy of taxes is traceable to any
			<lb />
			entry in List II and List III, residuary power under entry 97
			<lb />
			of List I read with Article 248 of the Constitution of India will
			<lb />
			not be available to it, the same having been specifically
			<lb />
			restricted under entry 97 of List I and Article 248 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(u)
			<lb />
			In the instant case, the power to tax on lotteries
			<lb />
			or even &quot;betting and gambling&quot; is not available under any of
			<lb />
			the entries of List I. However, such power is germane to
			<lb />
			and emanates from entry 62 of List II in Seventh Schedule,
			<lb />
			meaning thereby that the residuary power to enact a law
			<lb />
			imposing tax on lotteries would not be available to the
			<lb />
			Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			Mr. Razzak, Learned Additional Solicitor General,
			<lb />
			submits that since the service tax is a new concept and a
			<lb />
			new tax regime, it could not be said that at the time of
			<lb />
			enacting the entries the intention of the Framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution was to include all kinds of future taxes within
			<lb />
			the purview of taxes under Entry 62 or for that matter any
			<lb />
			other entry in Seventh Schedule, wherein the power to enact
			<lb />
			a law imposing taxes has been indicated. His submission is
			<lb />
			that service tax is not mentioned in any of the entries and
			<lb />
			thus it should be deemed to be excluded from Entry 62 or
			<lb />
			for that matter any other entry in Lists II and III to Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule.
			<lb />
			This argument apparently appears to be
			<lb />
			attractive but its fallacy is exposed if the proposition is
			<lb />
			applied to all taxing entries irrespective of Lists. On the
			<lb />
			same analogy, the power to impose a tax not prevalent or
			<lb />
			envisaged when entry 97 was incorporated in List I, the
			<lb />
			service tax would also be beyond its purview. &quot;Tax&quot; has
			<lb />
			been defined under the Black&apos;s Law Dictionary in the
			<lb />
			following manner: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;tax, n.
			<lb />
			A monetary charge imposed by the
			<lb />
			government on persons, entitles, transactions, or
			<lb />
			property to yield public revenue. • Most broadly, the term
			<lb />
			embraces all governmental impositions on the person,
			<lb />
			property, privileges, occupations, and enjoyment of the
			<lb />
			people, and includes duties, imposts, and excises.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Although a tax is often thought of as being pecuniary in
			<lb />
			nature, it is not necessarily payable in money.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(w)
			<lb />
			Article 366 of the Constitution of India defines
			<lb />
			various expressions used in the Constitution. &quot;Taxation and
			<lb />
			Tax&quot; being one of such expressions defined under clause
			<lb />
			(28) thereof. The relevant extract reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 366.
			<lb />
			Definitions.-In
			<lb />
			this Constitution, unless the
			<lb />
			context otherwise requires, the following expressions
			<lb />
			have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them,
			<lb />
			that is to say -
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
			…………………………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(28) &quot;taxation&quot; includes the imposition of any tax or
			<lb />
			impost, whether general or local or special, and &quot;tax&quot;
			<lb />
			shall be construed accordingly;
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
			…………………………………………………………………………………&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(x)
			<lb />
			This definition is of widest possible amplitude and
			<lb />
			encompasses within its field any kind of tax that could be
			<lb />
			visualized or conceptualized. In D. G. Gose and Co. Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. State of Kerala &amp; Anr. : (1980) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			410, a Constitution Bench of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			while considering clause (28) of Article 366 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5. The word &quot;tax&quot; in its widest sense includes all
			<lb />
			money raised by taxation. It therefore includes taxes
			<lb />
			levied by the Central and the State legislatures, and also
			<lb />
			those known as &quot;rates&quot;, or other charges, levied by local
			<lb />
			authorities under statutory powers. &quot;Taxation&quot; has
			<lb />
			therefore been defined in clause (28) of Article 366 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution to include &quot;the imposition of any tax or
			<lb />
			impost, whether general or local or special&quot;, and it has
			<lb />
			been
			<lb />
			directed
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			&quot;tax&quot;
			<lb />
			shall
			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			&quot;construed
			<lb />
			accordingly&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(y)
			<lb />
			Various entries empowering the Parliament and
			<lb />
			State Legislatures to enact laws for levy of tax do not mean
			<lb />
			or confine the kind of taxes prevalent or in vogue at the time
			<lb />
			these entries were enacted in Seventh Schedule. The word
			<lb />
			&quot;tax&quot; includes all kinds of taxation present or future that
			<lb />
			may be thought of by the competent legislative body. Thus
			<lb />
			the argument of Mr. Razzak that service tax does not find
			<lb />
			mention in entry 62 and thus is beyond its purview cannot
			<lb />
			be accepted or appreciated. Any kind of tax that may be
			<lb />
			envisaged and can be legally conceptualized by the
			<lb />
			legislative body falls within the purview of tax in view of all
			<lb />
			embracing definition of expressions &quot;tax (taxation)&quot; under
			<lb />
			clause (28) of Article 366.
			<lb />
			Service tax though a new
			<lb />
			regime, it would be antithesis of the term &quot;tax&quot; if considered
			<lb />
			to be a category of tax not envisaged by any of the entries
			<lb />
			in Seventh Schedule empowering to levy tax. Applying the
			<lb />
			principle of pith and substance, the power to levy tax on
			<lb />
			lottery being a game of chance and included in the
			<lb />
			expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot; in entry 62 List II, the
			<lb />
			State Legislature has the exclusive legislative competence
			<lb />
			and jurisdiction of Parliament to levy such a tax in exercise
			<lb />
			of its residuary power under entry 97 of the List I read with
			<lb />
			Article 248 of the Constitution stand excluded. There is
			<lb />
			another important aspect; entry 92C -&apos;Taxes on services&apos;
			<lb />
			was also incorporated in List I Seventh Schedule by Eighty-
			<lb />
			eighth Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003. However, this
			<lb />
			entry has not been notified till date.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(z)
			<lb />
			Our opinion that the Parliament lacks legislative
			<lb />
			competence to levy service tax on lotteries in exercise of its
			<lb />
			legislative power flowing from entry 97 List I read with
			<lb />
			Article 248 of the Constitution should not be construed to
			<lb />
			mean that the Parliament has no jurisdiction whatsoever to
			<lb />
			levy service tax in respect of any of the subject matter. The
			<lb />
			legislative competence of the Parliament to impose service
			<lb />
			tax has to be conceded by virtue of entry 97 List I read with
			<lb />
			Article 248 of the Constitution as held by Hon&apos;ble Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in various judgments noticed by us hereinbefore and
			<lb />
			later part of this judgment. However, such legislative power
			<lb />
			is prohibited in respect to any subject matter where the
			<lb />
			power to impose or levy tax has been conferred upon the
			<lb />
			State Legislature in List II (State List) or the Provincial
			<lb />
			Legislature and the Parliament under List III (Concurrent
			<lb />
			List). It is also pertinent to say that Parliament would also
			<lb />
			be deprived of the residuary power in respect to any subject
			<lb />
			matter falling even in the List I where such power is
			<lb />
			traceable to any of the entries contained therein i.e. entries
			<lb />
			1 to 96. In our view the residuary powers of the Parliament
			<lb />
			would come into play only where none of the entries in any
			<lb />
			of the Lists provide for a legislative field. As held by the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in State of West Bengal v. Kesoram
			<lb />
			Industries Ltd. (supra), the only embargo in the exercise
			<lb />
			of the residuary power of Parliament under entry 97 List I
			<lb />
			read with Article 248 of the Constitution would be non-
			<lb />
			existence of legislative power of any of the Legislatures
			<lb />
			under Lists II and III, Schedule 7. At the cost of repetition
			<lb />
			we may say that where the legislative power whether to
			<lb />
			enact a law in general or for levy of tax in particular, is not
			<lb />
			envisaged under Lists II and III, the Parliament would be
			<lb />
			fully competent to enact a law including imposing a tax
			<lb />
			(Service Tax) under entry 97 List I.
			<lb />
			We are of the
			<lb />
			considered view that Parliament would have had the
			<lb />
			legislative competence to impose tax including service tax
			<lb />
			upon lotteries but for entry 62, List II. It is the exclusive
			<lb />
			legislative domain of the State Legislature to levy tax of any
			<lb />
			nature on lotteries by virtue of entry 62 List II, Schedule 7.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iv) whether the State legislature and Parliament both
			<lb />
			can simultaneously impose taxes on the conduct
			<lb />
			of lottery by the State Government under entry 62
			<lb />
			of List II and entry 97 of List I to Schedule 7, if so,
			<lb />
			under what circumstances;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(aa)
			<lb />
			Mr. Farooq Md. Razzak, Addl. Solicitor General,
			<lb />
			appearing for the Union of India, submits that the service
			<lb />
			tax levied vide the impugned clause (zzzzn) to Sub-section
			<lb />
			(105) of Section 65 is not a tax on the activity of &quot;betting
			<lb />
			and gambling&quot; but on services like promotion, marketing,
			<lb />
			organising or in any other manner assisting in organising
			<lb />
			games of chance including lottery. His further submission is
			<lb />
			that the service tax is on an activity and is a Value Addition
			<lb />
			Tax.
			<lb />
			In other words, his contention is that the value
			<lb />
			addition is on account of the activities like marketing,
			<lb />
			organising and promoting the lottery and such activities
			<lb />
			render value addition to the lotteries held by the State of
			<lb />
			Sikkim and, thus,
			<lb />
			does not fall within the purview of
			<lb />
			&quot;betting and gambling&quot; in entry 62 of List II. It is his
			<lb />
			submission that on account of non-application of entry 62,
			<lb />
			the Parliament is entitled to exercise its legislative
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to enact the law under its residuary power under
			<lb />
			entry 97 of List I. According to Mr. Razzak, a lottery ticket
			<lb />
			of Re.1/-is being given to the petitioner&apos;s company for 70
			<lb />
			paise for providing various services as noticed by us in the
			<lb />
			earlier part of this judgment and the service tax is
			<lb />
			chargeable on the gross amount of the lottery tickets under
			<lb />
			Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended by Finance
			<lb />
			Act, 2010. It is further argued that the measure of tax
			<lb />
			cannot be questioned by the petitioner that too in writ
			<lb />
			proceedings and that it is for the competent adjudicating
			<lb />
			authority to decide the issue. It is contended that the
			<lb />
			petitioner has directly approached this Court without having
			<lb />
			approached the competent adjudicating authority in this
			<lb />
			regard. Under such circumstances, the petitioner should be
			<lb />
			directed to approach the competent adjudicating authority
			<lb />
			for seeking adjudication regarding levy of service tax on the
			<lb />
			service rendered by it. He has placed reliance upon the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Apex Court reported as Association of
			<lb />
			Leasing &amp; Financial Service Companies v. Union of
			<lb />
			India : (2011) 2 SCC 352.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ab)
			<lb />
			In the above case the controversy before the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court was with regard to levy of service
			<lb />
			tax on the transaction of equipment leasing and hire
			<lb />
			purchases undertaken by non-banking financial companies.
			<lb />
			The plea of the writ petitioners who challenged the vires of
			<lb />
			the levy was that the transaction of equipment leasing and
			<lb />
			hire purchase and financing has been constitutionally
			<lb />
			defined as sale and purchase under Article 366 (29A) and
			<lb />
			thus falls within the exclusive competence of State
			<lb />
			Legislature under entry 54 of List II, hence the Parliament in
			<lb />
			exercise of its legislative competence under entry 97 of List I
			<lb />
			of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is not competent to
			<lb />
			levy service tax. Hon&apos;ble Apex Court on consideration of
			<lb />
			entire issue came to the conclusion that part of the
			<lb />
			transaction constitute sale for which the State Legislature is
			<lb />
			competent to impose tax under entry 54 of List II whereas
			<lb />
			the components of the transaction constituting service fall
			<lb />
			within the legislative competence of the Parliament under its
			<lb />
			residuary power under entry 97 of List I.
			<lb />
			Validity of the
			<lb />
			service tax imposed under Section 65(105)(zm) was thus
			<lb />
			upheld. The relevant observations in this regard are quoted
			<lb />
			hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;59. Applying the above decisions to the present case,
			<lb />
			on examination of the impugned legislation in its entirety,
			<lb />
			we are of the view that the impugned levy relates to or is
			<lb />
			with respect to the particular topic of &quot;banking and other
			<lb />
			financial services&quot; which includes within it one of the
			<lb />
			several enumerated services viz. financial leasing
			<lb />
			services. These include long-term financing by banks and
			<lb />
			other financial institutions (including NBFCs). These are
			<lb />
			services rendered to their customers which comes within
			<lb />
			the meaning of the expression &quot;taxable services&quot; as
			<lb />
			defined in Section 65(105)(zm). The taxable event under
			<lb />
			the impugned law is the rendition of service. The
			<lb />
			impugned tax is not on material or sale. It is on
			<lb />
			activity/service rendered by the service provider to its
			<lb />
			customer. Equipment leasing/hire-purchase finance are
			<lb />
			long-term financing activities undertaken as their
			<lb />
			business by NBFCs. As far as the taxable value in case of
			<lb />
			financial leasing including equipment leasing and hire
			<lb />
			purchase is concerned, the amount received as principal
			<lb />
			is not the consideration for services rendered. Such
			<lb />
			amount is credited to the capital account of the
			<lb />
			lessor/hire-purchase
			<lb />
			service
			<lb />
			provider.
			<lb />
			It
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			interest/finance charge which is treated as income or
			<lb />
			revenue and which is credited to the revenue account.
			<lb />
			Such interest or finance charges together with the lease
			<lb />
			management fee/processing fee/documentation charges
			<lb />
			are treated as considerations for the services rendered
			<lb />
			and accordingly they constitute the value of taxable
			<lb />
			services on which service tax is made payable.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			60. In fact, the Government has given exemption from
			<lb />
			payment of service tax to financial leasing services
			<lb />
			including equipment leasing and hire purchase on that
			<lb />
			portion of taxable value comprising of 90% of the amount
			<lb />
			representing as interest i.e. the difference between the
			<lb />
			instalment paid towards repayment of the lease amount
			<lb />
			and the principal amount in such instalments paid (see
			<lb />
			Notification No. 4/2006 -Service Tax dated 1-3-2006).
			<lb />
			In other words, service tax is leviable only on 10% of the
			<lb />
			interest portion. (See also Circular F. No. B.11/1/2001-
			<lb />
			TRU dated 9-7-2001 in which it has been clarified that
			<lb />
			service tax, in the case of financial leasing including
			<lb />
			equipment leasing and hire purchase, will be leviable only
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			lease
			<lb />
			management
			<lb />
			fees/processing
			<lb />
			fees/documentation charges recovered at the time of
			<lb />
			entering into the agreement and on the finance/interest
			<lb />
			charges recovered in equated monthly instalments and
			<lb />
			not on the principal amount.) Merely because for
			<lb />
			valuation purposes inter alia &quot;finance/interest charges&quot;
			<lb />
			are taken into account and merely because service tax is
			<lb />
			imposed on financial services with reference to
			<lb />
			&quot;hiring/interest&quot; charges, the impugned tax does not
			<lb />
			cease to be service tax and nor does it become tax on
			<lb />
			hire-purchase/leasing transactions under Article 366(29-
			<lb />
			A) read with Entry 54, List II. Thus, while the State
			<lb />
			Legislature is competent to impose tax on &quot;sale&quot; by
			<lb />
			legislation relatable to Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule, tax on the aspect of the &quot;services&quot;, vendor not
			<lb />
			being relatable to any entry in the State List, would be
			<lb />
			within the legislative competence of Parliament under
			<lb />
			Article 248 read with Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule to the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ac)
			<lb />
			It may be noticed that the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court
			<lb />
			split the transaction into two components i.e. &quot;sale&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;service&quot;. It is pertinent to note that the service tax was
			<lb />
			imposed only on the component of the service @ 10 % of
			<lb />
			the contract value.
			<lb />
			While considering the nature of
			<lb />
			transaction it was noticed by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court
			<lb />
			that the part of the transaction like interest/ financing
			<lb />
			charges with lease management fee, processing fee and
			<lb />
			documentation charges are consideration for rendering
			<lb />
			service by the non-banking financial companies and thus
			<lb />
			held that it fell within the definition of &quot;taxable service&quot;
			<lb />
			defined in Section 65 (105)(zm).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ad)
			<lb />
			Another judgment heavily relied upon by Mr.
			<lb />
			Razzak is (2004) 5 SCC 632 : T.N. Kalyanamandapam
			<lb />
			Association vs. Union of India &amp; Others. In this case
			<lb />
			vires of Sections 65(19), (20), (41)(p), and 66, 67(o) of the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 1994 as amended from time to time were
			<lb />
			assailed being ultra vires.
			<lb />
			Under the above provisions
			<lb />
			service tax was levied on the services rendered by the
			<lb />
			mandap-keepers in respect of the temporary leasing of land
			<lb />
			for organizing official, social or business functions and even
			<lb />
			for catering services which inter alia included furniture,
			<lb />
			fixtures, light fittings, floor covering etc. on 60% of the
			<lb />
			gross amount charged by the mandap-keepers. The vires of
			<lb />
			the provision was challenged on the ground that it was a tax
			<lb />
			on land and building under entries 18 and 49 of List II of the
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule. It also amounted to tax on sale under
			<lb />
			entry 54 of List II particularly in view of definition of &apos;sale&apos;
			<lb />
			and &apos;purchase&apos; under Article 366 (29A)(f).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ae)
			<lb />
			The High Court rejected the contention and in
			<lb />
			appeal the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court affirmed the judgment
			<lb />
			holding that the activity of mandap-keepers does not fall in
			<lb />
			any of the entries i.e. 18 and 49 of the State List. As
			<lb />
			regards the entry 54, it has been held that the tax had been
			<lb />
			levied on 60% of the gross receipts. It was further held that
			<lb />
			predominantly the activity of the mandap-keepers was
			<lb />
			rendering various kinds of services. Applying the aspect
			<lb />
			doctrine, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;58. A tax on services rendered by mandap-keepers
			<lb />
			and outdoor caterers is in pith and substance, a tax on
			<lb />
			services and not a tax on sale of goods or on hire-
			<lb />
			purchase activities. Section 65 clause (41) sub-clause (p)
			<lb />
			of the Finance Act, 1994, defines taxable service (which is
			<lb />
			the subject-matter of levy of service tax) as any service
			<lb />
			provided to a customer
			<lb />
			&quot;by a mandap-keeper in relation to the use of a
			<lb />
			mandap in any manner including the facilities
			<lb />
			provided to [a customer] in relation to such use
			<lb />
			and also the services, if any, rendered as a
			<lb />
			caterer&quot;.
			<lb />
			The nature and character of this service tax is evident
			<lb />
			from the fact that the transaction between a mandap-
			<lb />
			keeper and his customer is definitely not in the nature of
			<lb />
			a sale or hire-purchase of goods. It is essentially that of
			<lb />
			providing a service. In fact, as pointed out earlier, the
			<lb />
			manner of service provided assumes predominance over
			<lb />
			the providing of food in such situations which is a definite
			<lb />
			indicator of the supremacy of the service aspect. The
			<lb />
			legislature in its wisdom noticed the said supremacy and
			<lb />
			identified the same as a potential region to collect indirect
			<lb />
			taxes. Moreover, it has been a well-established judicial
			<lb />
			principle that so long as the legislation is in substance, on
			<lb />
			a matter assigned to a legislature enacting that statute, it
			<lb />
			must be held valid in its entirety even though it may
			<lb />
			trench upon matters beyond its competence. Incidental
			<lb />
			encroachment does not invalidate such a statute on the
			<lb />
			grounds that it is beyond the competence of the
			<lb />
			legislature (Prafulla Kumar v. Bank of Commerce [ AIR
			<lb />
			1947 PC 60 :
		</item>

		<p>
			74 IA 23] ). Article 246(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution specifies that Parliament has exclusive
			<lb />
			powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters
			<lb />
			enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to the
			<lb />
			Constitution. As per Article 246(3), the State Government
			<lb />
			has exclusive powers to make laws with respect to
			<lb />
			matters enumerated in List II (State List). In respect of
			<lb />
			matters enumerated in List III (Concurrent List) both
			<lb />
			Parliament and State Governments have powers to make
			<lb />
			laws. The service tax is made by Parliament under the
			<lb />
			above residuary powers.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(af)
			<lb />
			Another judgment on which emphasis has been
			<lb />
			laid on behalf of respondents is (2007) 7 SCC 527 : All
			<lb />
			India Federation of Tax Practitioners &amp; Others vs.
			<lb />
			Union of India &amp; Others. In this case levy of service tax
			<lb />
			on practicing Chartered Accountants, Cost Accountants and
			<lb />
			Architects vide the Finance Act, 1994 was assailed. The
			<lb />
			challenge was based upon the legislative competence of
			<lb />
			State Legislature to levy tax on professions, etc. under entry
			<lb />
			60 of List II and Article 276 of the Constitution of India. It
			<lb />
			was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the service
			<lb />
			tax on professionals is a tax on profession and thus beyond
			<lb />
			the legislative competence of the Parliament. Repelling the
			<lb />
			argument and drawing distinction between the tax on
			<lb />
			profession and services rendered by the professionals, the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;34. As stated above, Entry 60, List II refers to taxes on
			<lb />
			professions, etc. It is the tax on the individual person/firm
			<lb />
			or company. It is the tax on the status. A chartered
			<lb />
			accountant or a cost accountant obtains a licence or a
			<lb />
			privilege from the competent body to practise. On that
			<lb />
			privilege as such the State is competent to levy a tax
			<lb />
			under Entry 60. However, as stated above, Entry 60 is
			<lb />
			not a general entry. It cannot be read to include every
			<lb />
			activity undertaken by a chartered accountant/cost
			<lb />
			accountant/architect for consideration. Service tax is a
			<lb />
			tax on each activity undertaken by a chartered
			<lb />
			accountant/cost accountant or an architect. The cost
			<lb />
			accountant/chartered accountant/architect charges his
			<lb />
			client for advice or for auditing of accounts. Similarly, a
			<lb />
			cost accountant charges his client for advice as well as
			<lb />
			doing the work of costing. For each transaction or
			<lb />
			contract, the chartered accountant/cost accountant
			<lb />
			renders profession
			<lb />
			based
			<lb />
			services.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			activity
			<lb />
			undertaken by the chartered accountant or the cost
			<lb />
			accountant or an architect has two aspects. From the
			<lb />
			point of view of the chartered accountant/cost accountant
			<lb />
			it is an activity undertaken by him based on his
			<lb />
			performance and skill. But from the point of view of his
			<lb />
			client, the chartered accountant/cost accountant is his
			<lb />
			service provider. It is a tax on &quot;services&quot;. The activity
			<lb />
			undertaken by the chartered accountant or cost
			<lb />
			accountant is similar to saleable or marketable
			<lb />
			commodities produced by the assessee and cleared by
			<lb />
			the assessee for home consumption under the Central
			<lb />
			Excise Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			35. For each contract, tax is levied under the Finance
			<lb />
			Acts, 1994 and 1998. Tax cannot be levied under that Act
			<lb />
			without service being provided whereas a professional tax
			<lb />
			under Entry 60 is a tax on his status. It is the tax on the
			<lb />
			status of a cost accountant or a chartered accountant. As
			<lb />
			long as a person/firm remains in the profession, he/it has
			<lb />
			to pay professional tax. That tax has nothing to do with
			<lb />
			the commercial activities which he undertakes for his
			<lb />
			client. Even if the chartered accountant has no work
			<lb />
			throughout the accounting year, still he has to pay
			<lb />
			professional tax. He has to pay the tax till he remains in
			<lb />
			the profession. This is the ambit and scope of Entry 60,
			<lb />
			List II which is a taxing entry. Therefore, Entry 60
			<lb />
			contemplates tax on professions, as such. Entry 60, List
			<lb />
			II refers to &quot;tax on employments&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ag)
			<lb />
			From the ratio of above judgments, the
			<lb />
			emergence of proposition of law is that where the
			<lb />
			transaction or contract comprises of twin elements of sale
			<lb />
			and service, both, the State Legislature under entry 54 of
			<lb />
			List II and simultaneously the Parliament in exercise of
			<lb />
			residuary power under entry 97 of List I is competent to levy
			<lb />
			&quot;sales tax&quot; and &quot;service tax&quot; respectively provided the
			<lb />
			components of sale and service are visible and are capable
			<lb />
			of compartmentalization.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(v) whether such circumstances exist in the case in
			<lb />
			hand?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ah)
			<lb />
			The facts of the present case are clearly
			<lb />
			distinguishable as noticed in the earlier part of the
			<lb />
			discussion. We have opined that the State Government is
			<lb />
			not paying any consideration to the petitioners nor the
			<lb />
			petitioners are rendering any service to the State. To the
			<lb />
			contrary the petitioners are paying minimum guaranteed
			<lb />
			amount for the purchase of entire lot of lotteries at the
			<lb />
			discounted price of 70 paise against the MRP of Re.1/-to the
			<lb />
			State. The nature of discount has already been discussed in
			<lb />
			detail.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ai)
			<lb />
			It has been held by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (Supra) that
			<lb />
			the service is an activity and service tax is in the nature of
			<lb />
			VAT i.e. Value Added Tax. The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			State of Bombay vs R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala (supra)
			<lb />
			has also defined the betting and gambling as an activity.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(aj)
			<lb />
			In T.N. Kalyanamandapam Association&apos;s case
			<lb />
			(supra) the clear view of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court is that
			<lb />
			the predominant activity of the service provider was
			<lb />
			rendering of service and levy of service tax on 60% of the
			<lb />
			gross value was upheld. Similarly in Assn. of Leasing &amp;
			<lb />
			Financial Service Companies case levy of service tax on
			<lb />
			10% of the gross contract value was upheld being a tax on
			<lb />
			component of service.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ak)
			<lb />
			In the present case, undisputedly the lottery ticket
			<lb />
			is sold as a good by the State Government to the petitioners
			<lb />
			at the discounted value of 70 paise per ticket as against its
			<lb />
			gross value/ MRP of Re.1/-. The predominant part of the
			<lb />
			transaction is sale of goods. While considering the discount
			<lb />
			of 30% to the petitioners on the MRP, we have held that the
			<lb />
			discount is a normal trade practice in any transaction of sale
			<lb />
			and purchase. If the seller sells the goods at the MRP to its
			<lb />
			ultimate consumer, no intermediary will sell the goods
			<lb />
			unless he gets a discount to meet the expenditure for
			<lb />
			establishment, logistics and some component of profit. The
			<lb />
			State Government is unable to sell the tickets to the
			<lb />
			ultimate buyers and for that purpose the petitioners are
			<lb />
			appointed as stockists or distributors on payment of full sale
			<lb />
			consideration on discounted price. Further the sale by the
			<lb />
			petitioners to their stockists, selling agents etc is on
			<lb />
			discounted price from MRP after keeping the establishment
			<lb />
			and other expenditure and margin of profit for themselves.
			<lb />
			The last sale to the consumer of the lottery is on the MRP of
			<lb />
			Re.1/-per ticket. Thus, all the intermediaries have to be
			<lb />
			given discount from MRP for the purpose of meeting their
			<lb />
			expenditure and some component of profit.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			advertisement etc. is only to popularize the State lottery but
			<lb />
			that does not mean that it is a service rendered to the State
			<lb />
			Government. As argued by Mr. Madhav Rao, this is for
			<lb />
			promotion of their own sale at their own expense without
			<lb />
			recovering it from the State Government. In any case
			<lb />
			service tax is being levied and collected on the gross amount
			<lb />
			without even isolating the discounted cost of lottery ticket.
			<lb />
			Thus in the present case there does not seem to be any
			<lb />
			circumstance where the activity of sale of State organized
			<lb />
			lottery by the petitioners through its various stockists,
			<lb />
			agents etc. can be construed to be a service rendered to the
			<lb />
			State Government so as to enable the Central Government
			<lb />
			to impose service tax on any component or element of the
			<lb />
			transaction between the State and the petitioners
			<lb />
		</p>
		<head>
			Conclusions: -
			<lb />
		</head>
		<item>
			(i) In the backdrop of discussion on Ground (A) we
			<lb />
			have no hesitation to conclude that the activities
			<lb />
			of the lottery distributors i.e. the petitioners
			<lb />
			herein do not constitute a service and thus beyond
			<lb />
			the purview of &quot;taxable service&quot; as statutorily
			<lb />
			defined under clause (zzzzn) of sub-section 105 of
			<lb />
			Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended
			<lb />
			vide Finance Act, 2010.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The activity of promotion, marketing, organizing
			<lb />
			or in any other manner assisting in organising
			<lb />
			game of chance including lottery is an activity
			<lb />
			included in the expression &quot;betting and gambling&quot;
			<lb />
			as incorporated under Entry 34 and 62 of List II to
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) The activity of promotion, marketing, organizing
			<lb />
			or in any other manner assisting in organising
			<lb />
			game of chance including lottery being an activity
			<lb />
			of &quot;betting and gambling&quot; under Entry 62, List II
			<lb />
			to Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, the
			<lb />
			State Legislature alone is competent to levy any
			<lb />
			tax on such activity under Entry 62.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) The Parliament has the competence and
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to levy taxes on any subject matter
			<lb />
			including &quot;service tax&quot; under Entry 97, List I, read
			<lb />
			with Article 248 of the Constitution of India except
			<lb />
			where such powers are traceable to any of the
			<lb />
			entries in List II and III to Seventh Schedule of
			<lb />
			Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) Power to tax the activity of &quot;betting and gambling&quot;
			<lb />
			as explained above being within the exclusive
			<lb />
			domain of State Legislature under Entry 62, List
			<lb />
			II, the Parliament in exercise of its residuary
			<lb />
			power under Entry 97, List I to Seventh Schedule
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Constitution
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			India
			<lb />
			lacks
			<lb />
			legislative
			<lb />
			competence to impose any tax including &quot;service
			<lb />
			tax&quot; on such activity.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			19.
			<lb />
			In view of the above conclusions, we allow these
			<lb />
			petitions, strike down the clause (zzzzn) to sub-section 105
			<lb />
			of Section 65 of Finance Act, 1994 as introduced vide
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2010 as ultra vires to Constitution of India
			<lb />
			having been enacted in contravention to Entry 97, List I to
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule read with Article 248 of Constitution of
			<lb />
			India.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.
			<lb />
			We also set aside all the consequential actions of
			<lb />
			respondents imposing service tax upon the petitioners being
			<lb />
			distributors of lottery organized by State of Sikkim.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.
			<lb />
			Since the petitioners secured registration and paid
			<lb />
			service tax under the impugned provision on their own, this
			<lb />
			judgment shall operate prospectively.

			(XXIII) In Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. v. Union of
			<lb />
			India &amp; Anr. reported as 1984 (16) E.L.T. 76 (Bom.), it
			<lb />
			has been held that where distributor purchases goods on
			<lb />
			payment of a commercial price from the manufacturer, such
			<lb />
			a buyer is different from a distributor and does not create an
			<lb />
			agency. The relevant observations are noticed hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 10.
			<lb />
			Shri Dalal submitted that the agreement
			<lb />
			between the petitioners and Voltas is really not a
			<lb />
			distributorship agreement but is in the nature of agreement
			<lb />
			agency. The learned counsel relied upon Division Bench
			<lb />
			decision of this Court in the case of Amer Dye-Chem Limited
			<lb />
			and another v. Union of India and another reported in 1981
			<lb />
			Excise Law Times, 348 and submitted that the mere use of
			<lb />
			the word &apos;Distributor&apos; would not lead to the conclusion that
			<lb />
			the agreement is not an agreement of agency. The Division
			<lb />
			Bench observed that the distributor in the commercial world
			<lb />
			is understood to be person who distributes goods of the
			<lb />
			manufacturer to the consumer and in so doing he acts for
			<lb />
			and on behalf of the manufacturer. The distributor normally
			<lb />
			is, therefore, an agent of the manufacturer for the purpose
			<lb />
			of reaching out the goods to the consumers. Shri Dalal
			<lb />
			relied upon this observation and claims that Voltas were
			<lb />
			merely acting as Agents of the petitioners for reaching out
			<lb />
			the tractors to the consumers.
			<lb />
			The submission is not
			<lb />
			correct, as the Division Bench has further observed in the
			<lb />
			judgment that in the case of the buyer who purchases goods
			<lb />
			on payment of a commercial price to the manufacturer and
			<lb />
			transaction in effect is a sale, such a buyer is different from
			<lb />
			the distributor earlier noticed, though even such a buyer is
			<lb />
			sometimes described as a distributor. The distributor in such
			<lb />
			a case is in fact a wholesale buyer and the property in the
			<lb />
			goods passes to such a buyer. The submission of Shri Dalal,
			<lb />
			therefore, that as the agreement between the petitioners and
			<lb />
			the Voltas was described as a distributorship agreement, it
			<lb />
			should be treated as an agreement of agency cannot be
			<lb />
			accepted.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			11.
			<lb />
			Shri Dalal then submitted that under the
			<lb />
			agreement, the Voltas were required to carry out the
			<lb />
			activities of the manufacturers and, therefore, want the
			<lb />
			petitioners intended to do was to transfer some of the
			<lb />
			activities of the manufacturers to Voltas with a view to
			<lb />
			reduce the assessable value for the purpose of excise. In
			<lb />
			support of this submission, reliance is placed on three or four
			<lb />
			conditions under the agreement. It was urged that the
			<lb />
			Voltas were required to maintain a Sales Organisation and
			<lb />
			such a condition was not necessary in the agreement if the
			<lb />
			petitioners had sold the tractors to Voltas because then it
			<lb />
			was wholly irrelevant to provide as to how the Voltas should
			<lb />
			dispose of those tractors to the consumers. The condition
			<lb />
			under the agreement which provides that Voltas were to
			<lb />
			store the tractors till they are sold to the consumers was also
			<lb />
			relied upon to claim that the agreement was not at arms
			<lb />
			length. The provision which required Voltas to carry out
			<lb />
			afte4r-sale service and the condition which required the
			<lb />
			petitioners to share half the amount spent on advertisements
			<lb />
			were highlighted to claim that the price for which the tractors
			<lb />
			were sold to Voltas did not reflect the true price. It was
			<lb />
			urged that the price at which the tractors were sold by the
			<lb />
			petitioners to Voltas was far less than the market price
			<lb />
			because certain activities required to be performed by the
			<lb />
			manufacturers were taken over by the Voltas. It is not
			<lb />
			possible to accept this submission. In the first instance, on
			<lb />
			the date when the agreement was entered into, the tractors
			<lb />
			were not liable to be assessed for excise duty and, therefore,
			<lb />
			there was no occasion to prepare an agreement with an
			<lb />
			intention to avoid the duty.
			<lb />
			Secondly, the conditions
			<lb />
			requiring Voltas to set up Sales Organisation and to provide
			<lb />
			after-sale service are the usual conditions provided in the
			<lb />
			agreement with the wholesale buyer and such conditions
			<lb />
			were also in existence in the agreement which was
			<lb />
			considered by the Supreme Court in the Voltas&apos; case. The
			<lb />
			fact that the Voltas were required to store the tractors till
			<lb />
			they are sold to the consumers cannot be treated as transfer
			<lb />
			of manufacturer&apos;s activity in favour of the buyer. The fact
			<lb />
			that the expenses in regard to the advertisements were to be
			<lb />
			shared by the petitioners and Voltas merely indicate that
			<lb />
			both the wholesale buyer and the petitioners were interested
			<lb />
			in having greater production and sale thereof and that
			<lb />
			condition, in my judgment, cannot be considered as relevant
			<lb />
			to reach the conclusion that the agreement was not at arms
			<lb />
			length.&quot;

			(XXIV) In Pioneer Tools and Appliances (P) Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Union of India : 1989 (42) E.L.T. 384 (Bom.), it has
			<lb />
			been held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;
			<lb />
			5. This judgment clearly demonstrates the fallacy of the
			<lb />
			reasoning adopted by the first respondent in the order
			<lb />
			passed in revision. Mr. R. L. Dalal, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, however, laid emphasis upon the fact that
			<lb />
			Rallis India was described as the first petitioner&apos;s distributor.
			<lb />
			He referred me to the decision of the division bench of this
			<lb />
			court in Amar Dye-Chem Limited and another v. Union of
			<lb />
			India and another, 1981 E.L.T. 348. The court held that the
			<lb />
			distributor normally was an agent of the manufacturer for
			<lb />
			the purpose of distributing the goods to the consumers. He
			<lb />
			was not a buyer of the goods from the manufacturer on his
			<lb />
			own account and did not himself pay the price of the goods
			<lb />
			purchased before the goods were passed on to the
			<lb />
			consumer. But, merely by the use of the word &apos;distributor&apos; in
			<lb />
			the list filed by the petitioner, it could not be said that the
			<lb />
			distributor was a related person. What was material was the
			<lb />
			real substance of the transaction. If the distributor bought
			<lb />
			the goods and the price was the sole consideration of the
			<lb />
			sale and the transaction was at arms length, he could not be
			<lb />
			categorized as a related person. In the case of a buyer who
			<lb />
			purchased, the goods on payment of a commercial price,
			<lb />
			from the manufacturer and the transaction in effection was a
			<lb />
			sole, such a buyer even though a kind of distributor was
			<lb />
			different from the distributor who acted as an agent of or on
			<lb />
			behalf of the manufacturer. In such a case the distributor
			<lb />
			was in fact the wholesale buyer and the property and the
			<lb />
			goods passed such a buyer. It is difficult to see how this
			<lb />
			judgment furthers the respondent&apos;s case. It is averred in the
			<lb />
			petition and, indeed, has been averred at all the times by the
			<lb />
			first petitioners before the authorities that they sold their
			<lb />
			products to Rallis India on an outright basis in a arms length
			<lb />
			transaction. There is no statement by the authorities which
			<lb />
			disputes this. There is no affidavit-in-reply which disputes
			<lb />
			the correctness of the averment made in the petition. It
			<lb />
			must, therefore, be accepted that this was the real nature of
			<lb />
			the transaction between them.
			<lb />
			This being so, it is
			<lb />
			immaterial that Rallis India is described as the distributor of
			<lb />
			the first petitioners.&quot;

			(XXV)
			<lb />
			In Philips India Ltd. v. Collector of Central
			<lb />
			Excise : (1997) 91 E.L.T. 540, it has been held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;6. As to the after sales service that the dealer was
			<lb />
			required under the agreement to provide, it did of course
			<lb />
			enhance in the eyes of intending purchasers the value of the
			<lb />
			appellant&apos;s product, but such enhancement of value ensured
			<lb />
			not only for the benefit of the appellant; it also ensured for
			<lb />
			the benefit of the dealer for, by reason thereof, the dealer
			<lb />
			got to sell more and earn a larger profit. The guarantee
			<lb />
			attached to the appellant&apos;s products specified that they could
			<lb />
			be repaired during the guarantee period by the appellant&apos;s
			<lb />
			dealers anywhere in the country. Thus, though one dealer
			<lb />
			might have to repair goods sold by another dealer and incur
			<lb />
			costs in that regard, he also had the benefit of having the
			<lb />
			goods he sold reparable throughout the country.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			provision as to after sales service, therefore, benefitted not
			<lb />
			only the appellant; it was a provision of mutual benefit to the
			<lb />
			appellant and the dealer.&quot;

			(XXVI) Similarly, in Collector of Central Excise,
			<lb />
			Baroda v. Besta Cosmetics Ltd. reported as 2005 (183)
			<lb />
			E.L.T. 122 (SC), it has been held that the clause of
			<lb />
			advertisement being purely optional would not militate
			<lb />
			against the price which is at arm&apos;s length. The following
			<lb />
			observations are relevant: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;2.
			<lb />
			In addition, we may note that the relevant
			<lb />
			clause in the agreement between the assessee and its
			<lb />
			Marketing Agent relating to advertisements reads as follows
			<lb />
			(wherein the marketing agent is referred to as BHPL) :
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;BHPL shall market the said product in the trade
			<lb />
			name or the trademark of BCL in respect of the said
			<lb />
			product. BHPL may, at its own free will, make it known
			<lb />
			generally that the products of BCL are marketed by
			<lb />
			them. BHPL for this matter, may adopt such ways and
			<lb />
			means and may incur such expenses on Advertising and
			<lb />
			Business promotion as it may deem fit and necessary.
			<lb />
			At the same time, BHPL should ensure that it does not
			<lb />
			infringe or in any way prejudicially effect the trade
			<lb />
			name and or trademark of the said product.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3.
			<lb />
			The appellant has sought to rely upon the
			<lb />
			decision of this Court in Commissioner of Central Excise,
			<lb />
			Surat v. Surat Textile Mills Ltd. -2004 (5) SCC 201. In that
			<lb />
			decision the Court appears to have upheld the view that
			<lb />
			where the advertisement cost is incurred by the
			<lb />
			manufacturers/customers compulsorily or mandatorily, and
			<lb />
			where the manufacturer has an enforceable legal right
			<lb />
			against the customers to insist on incurring of such
			<lb />
			advertisement
			<lb />
			expenditure
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			customers,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			advertisement cost would be includible in the assessable
			<lb />
			value. Without in any fashion affirming the view taken
			<lb />
			therein it is clear even on the basis of the judgment that the
			<lb />
			clause in question gave the manufacturers/marketing agent,
			<lb />
			the discretion whether or not to advertise the assessee&apos;s
			<lb />
			products. There was no &apos;enforceable legal right&apos; with the
			<lb />
			assessee to insist on the advertisement under the
			<lb />
			agreement.&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>
			(XXVII) A question whether discount granted by the State
			<lb />
			of Kerala on sale of lotteries to distributors is in nature of
			<lb />
			commission liable to income tax deduction at source under
			<lb />
			Income Tax Act came to be considered by High Court of
			<lb />
			Kerala in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax,
			<lb />
			Thiruvananthapuram v. M. S. Hameed. It has been held
			<lb />
			that the relationship between the distributors in the trade of
			<lb />
			lottery as being one of principal to principal and the discount
			<lb />
			of lottery is not a commission and thus, provision of Section
			<lb />
			194(G) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which obliged a person
			<lb />
			to deduct tax at source on payment of commission, will not
			<lb />
			be attracted.
			<lb />
			The relevant extract of the judgment is
			<lb />
			reproduced hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;
			<lb />
			4. The petitioners receive in bulk quantities of lottery
			<lb />
			tickets from the State Government.
			<lb />
			They are given a
			<lb />
			discount which is on a slab system. Exhibit P-1 is the
			<lb />
			governing order issued in 1998. The agents commission
			<lb />
			presently payable is as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 100 tickets 25%
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 101 and above 27.5%
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 50,001 and above 28%
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
			For the purchase of 70,00,001 and above 28.5%
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			5.
			<lb />
			The import of the order will be that for a ticket worth
			<lb />
			Re. 1 an agent need pay between 75 paise to 71.5 paise
			<lb />
			only, depending on the off take. The petitioner submits that
			<lb />
			there is no agency agreement, and the petitioners are
			<lb />
			termed as agents only on a loose basis. From the nature of
			<lb />
			the transactions, the Government and the petitioners deal as
			<lb />
			principal to principal. The tickets purchased are thereafter
			<lb />
			distributed through other agents, and sub-agents, according
			<lb />
			to them, on commission basis. They point out that after
			<lb />
			purchase of the tickets, it is not the Government&apos;s look out
			<lb />
			as to how and when they are divided or distributed, and
			<lb />
			there is no control over the affairs thereafter. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			principal contention of the petitioner is that there is only
			<lb />
			payment of the price of the tickets fixed as payable by the
			<lb />
			principal, and no commission or discount are paid to them by
			<lb />
			the Government.
			<lb />
			As such, it is the contention of the
			<lb />
			petitioners that Section 194G of the Act has no application,
			<lb />
			and hence the demand of tax, as coming through exhibit P-4
			<lb />
			is unsustainable and without jurisdiction.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………

		<item>
			7.
			<lb />
			Before exhibit P-4, the deduction of ten per cent, was
			<lb />
			not being made, and the petitioners submit that thereafter
			<lb />
			the tax deduction has commenced. The submission of Mr. K.
			<lb />
			R. Prasad, senior counsel, appearing on instructions, for the
			<lb />
			petitioners, could be summarized as following: The
			<lb />
			provisions for collection and recovery of Income Tax
			<lb />
			appearing in Chapter XVII of the Act refers to various
			<lb />
			methods, viz., deduction at source, collection at source,
			<lb />
			advance payment of tax, collection by recovery and levy of
			<lb />
			interests, etc. Since Section 194G comes within the sub-
			<lb />
			heading &quot;Deduction at source&quot;, for the mechanism, according
			<lb />
			to counsel, a statutory authorization is essential. When the
			<lb />
			petitioners purchase tickets, they became absolute owners
			<lb />
			thereof. He also referred to Rule 25 of the Kerala State
			<lb />
			Lottery Rules, to the effect that in the case of loss of tickets,
			<lb />
			no compensation was payable. The petitioners were never
			<lb />
			agents of the State, and in no capacity, render any service to
			<lb />
			the State. For the face value of a ticket of Rs. 1, the
			<lb />
			petitioners were expected to pay 71.5 paise and they could
			<lb />
			have purchased a ticket worth one rupee by raising only 71.5
			<lb />
			paise. That the ticket might be worth one rupee did not
			<lb />
			mean that the balance of 28.5 paise was the petitioner&apos;
			<lb />
			income. Referring to the text book (Kanga and Palkiwala on
			<lb />
			Income-tax) (page 92, 7 th edition) he referred to the
			<lb />
			discussion based on the authorities to urge that mere relief
			<lb />
			from expense cannot be income. A person is chargeable to
			<lb />
			tax not on what he saves in his pocket, but what goes into
			<lb />
			his pocket. Counsel urged that Section 194G, as it stands in
			<lb />
			the statute book, cannot have application to the petitioners,
			<lb />
			as has been attempted to the explained by exhibit P-4.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			16
			<lb />
			If the face value of the ticket, for example, is Re. 1,
			<lb />
			notwithstanding the circumstance the petitioners receive it
			<lb />
			for 72 paise.
			<lb />
			The State, therefore, releases a ticket,
			<lb />
			receiving 72 paise. The petitioner may sell the ticket so
			<lb />
			obtained at any price of their choice. It is not the State&apos;s
			<lb />
			business to enquire into the matter at all. Therefore, it is
			<lb />
			difficult to assume that the petitioners have in all cases made
			<lb />
			a margin of 28 paise by the mere purchase of the ticket. His
			<lb />
			case is that resells it for 72.5 paise, and he derives a profit of
			<lb />
			half paise per ticket. He may be right or that may be a
			<lb />
			misleading statement. But he has been able to obtain a
			<lb />
			ticket worth Re. 1 for 72 paise. His total input therefore is
			<lb />
			72 paise, and in that context it is difficult to describe the
			<lb />
			transaction as one whereby because of investment of 72
			<lb />
			paise he has simultaneously made a profit of 28 paise.
			<lb />
			Several &quot;ifs&quot; have to be employed, which do not exist in real
			<lb />
			life, for this court to accept the case of the Department that
			<lb />
			by the factum of purchase he had already made a profit.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………
			<lb />

		<item>
			23.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the demand of tax is to be shown as one on
			<lb />
			the income of the person concerned.
			<lb />
			There is neither
			<lb />
			payment of cash or by cheque, and the Government never
			<lb />
			credits any income to the account of the persons like the
			<lb />
			petitioners. When the deduction is contemplated at the time
			<lb />
			of payment to the person concerned and when it is shown
			<lb />
			that there is no payment to the agent at the time of
			<lb />
			purchase of the ticket, the section automatically becomes
			<lb />
			inapplicable. If any prize or remuneration is payable by the
			<lb />
			Government, to any person, deduction at source as
			<lb />
			envisaged under the section, may arise.
			<lb />
			But when no
			<lb />
			payment is made in view of the mandate of the section, no
			<lb />
			deduction is envisaged.
			<lb />
			That the ticket is given on a
			<lb />
			discount of 28 per cent., can by no imagination be pressed
			<lb />
			into service for an interpretation that, none the less, ten per
			<lb />
			cent, of 28 paise is deductible as tax. Perhaps the intention
			<lb />
			might have been to bring the agents within the tax net, but
			<lb />
			the section as it stands, according to me, is not authority for
			<lb />
			taxation at source, as is envisaged by exhibit P-4.&quot;
			<lb />

			(XXVIII) Delhi High Court in Commissioner of Income
			<lb />
			Tax v. Jai Drinks Pvt. Ltd. reported as 2011 (336) ITR

			383 (Del.) expressed similar view and observed as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;3. A survey was conducted under Section 133A of the Act
			<lb />
			and the assessing officer passed an order holding that the
			<lb />
			payment made by the Assessee to the distributor constituted
			<lb />
			commission under Section 194H of the Act. The assessing
			<lb />
			officer held that the Assessee defaulted in not deducting the
			<lb />
			tax at source on the amount of commission paid to the
			<lb />
			distributor and consequently, determined the total tax
			<lb />
			liability of Rs.40,06,679/-under Section 201(1) &amp; 201 (1A)
			<lb />
			of the Act.
			<lb />
			Assessee preferred an appeal before the
			<lb />
			Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (hereinafter referred
			<lb />
			to as Commissioner (Appeals) which was allowed.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			Commissioner (Appeals) held the payments made by the
			<lb />
			Assessee as incentives in the normal course of buying and
			<lb />
			selling. The revenue preferred an appeal against this order
			<lb />
			before the ITAT which was dismissed holding that the nature
			<lb />
			of transaction between the Assessee and the distributor is
			<lb />
			not that of principal-agent, but principal-to-principal and that
			<lb />
			the payment given by Assessee to the distributor is nothing
			<lb />
			but a discount and did not have the characteristics of
			<lb />
			commission.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			9.
			<lb />
			From all that has been noted above, it is evident that
			<lb />
			the distributor was to purchase products at pre-determined
			<lb />
			price from the Assessee for selling the same within specified
			<lb />
			area. The products were to be purchased by the distributor
			<lb />
			against 100% advance payment or may be some times on
			<lb />
			credit at the discretion of the Assessee. Both the Assessee
			<lb />
			and the distributor have been collecting and paying their
			<lb />
			sales tax separately.
			<lb />
			Both the parties have clearly
			<lb />
			understood and accepted the agreement between them.
			<lb />
			That being the arrangement between the Assessee and the
			<lb />
			distributor, it could not be said that the relation between
			<lb />
			them was that of principal-agent. On the other hand it was
			<lb />
			clearly stipulated to be an agreement between them on
			<lb />
			principal-to-principal basis.
			<lb />
			Both the Commissioner
			<lb />
			(Appeals) and also the ITAT rightly held that the payments
			<lb />
			being made by the Assessee to the distributor were
			<lb />
			incentives and discounts and not commissions. We find no
			<lb />
			infirmity in the findings of the Commissioner (Appeals) and
			<lb />
			also ITAT.&quot;

			The petitioners&apos; case falls in Sl. No. 2, the prize money being

			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(XXXI) From the conjoint reading of Sections 66, 67 and
			<lb />
			Rule 7(C) it appears that the service tax payable by a
			<lb />
			service provider for promotion, marketing, organizing or in
			<lb />
			any manner assisting in organizing lottery @ 12% or in the
			<lb />
			manner indicated in the table above on the value of the
			<lb />
			service provided or to be provided. In respect to the online
			<lb />
			lotteries the aggregate value of the lottery ticket is to be
			<lb />
			taken as the value of the service on which service tax is
			<lb />
			payable. In respect to the paper lottery also the same mode
			<lb />
			has been adopted and gross value of the lottery ticket has
			<lb />
			been taken as the valuation for the purpose of levy of
			<lb />
			service tax. During the course of argument, Mr. Razzak
			<lb />
			after seeking instructions admitted that the service tax is
			<lb />
			being charged at the gross value of the lottery ticket i.e.
			<lb />
			Re.1/-or in the manner prescribed in the Rule 7(C) as
			<lb />
			introduced vide Notification dated 8 th October, 2010. It is
			<lb />
			relevant to note that according to Mr. Razzak&apos;s submission
			<lb />
			the 30% discount allowed by the State Government to the
			<lb />
			petitioners is for rendering service, whereas admittedly 70
			<lb />
			paise is the price of the lottery ticket.
			<lb />
			According to
			<lb />
			respondents own case only 30% amount of the gross value
			<lb />
			can be taken as the valuation for providing service if at all
			<lb />
			the activity of petitioners is to be construed as a service and
			<lb />
			falls within the definition of &quot;taxable service&quot;. The Ministry
			<lb />
			of Finance (Department of Revenue), Central Board of Excise
			<lb />
			and Customs, Government of India has also issued a
			<lb />
			clarificatory circular dated 10.11.2006 laying down the
			<lb />
			criterion for levy of service tax. The relevant extract is
			<lb />
			reproduced hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;4. To levy service tax, the following criteria are to be
			<lb />
			satisfied:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			.
			<lb />
			The service provided or to be provided satisfies
			<lb />
			the definition of taxable service.
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			There should be receipt of consideration for the
			<lb />
			taxable service provided.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(XXXII) In view of the above clarification, it is pleaded on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioners that receipt of consideration for
			<lb />
			providing &quot;taxable service&quot; is one of the essential ingredients
			<lb />
			to establish that any service is a &quot;taxable service&quot;. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that in the instant case, the Government does not
			<lb />
			pay any consideration in any form for the activities to be
			<lb />
			performed by the petitioner for promotion of the sale by
			<lb />
			advertisement etc. To the contrary, the petitioner is paying
			<lb />
			the minimum guaranteed sum towards the full sale
			<lb />
			consideration to the Government and thus the entire claim
			<lb />
			of the respondents that the petitioner is providing taxable
			<lb />
			service is belied by its own circular and understanding of the
			<lb />
			nature of the petitioner&apos;s activity.

			(i) whether the conduct of lottery is an Act of &quot;Betting
			<lb />
			and Gambling&quot; envisaged under entries 34 and 62
			<lb />
			of List II to Schedule 7
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(a)
			<lb />
			&quot;Lottery&quot; has been defined under Section 2(b) of
			<lb />
			the regulatory Act of 1998, which reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(b) &quot;lottery&quot; means a scheme, in whatever form and by
			<lb />
			whatever name called, for distribution of prizes by
			<lb />
			lot or chance to those persons participating in the
			<lb />
			chances of a prize by purchasing tickets;&quot;
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			From the above definition, it transpires that lottery is a
			<lb />
			game of chance of those persons who participate in the
			<lb />
			chances of a prize by purchasing tickets. The expressions
			<lb />
			&quot;betting and gambling&quot; have been defined in the Black&apos;s Law
			<lb />
			Dictionary separately in the following manner: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;betting -A system of gambling in which bets placed on
			<lb />
			a race are pooled and then paid to those holding winning
			<lb />
			tickets.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;gambling -The act of risking something of value, esp.
			<lb />
			money, for a chance to win a prize.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Above definitions include any act by which a person
			<lb />
			participates in a game of chances by risking money for
			<lb />
			purchase of ticket to win a prize. From these definitions and
			<lb />
			the definition of lottery under the regulatory Act, it is
			<lb />
			apparent that lottery is also a game of chance where a
			<lb />
			ticket-holder risks his money to win a prize on a chance.
			<lb />
			Section 294A of the IPC punishes a person who keeps any
			<lb />
			office or place for the purpose of drawing any lottery or even
			<lb />
			the proposal to pay any money or to deliver any goods on
			<lb />
			any event or contingency of any ticket or any figure in the
			<lb />
			lottery as an offence except where it is run or authorized by
			<lb />
			the State Government. The lottery, per se, does fall within
			<lb />
			the expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot; which Act is
			<lb />
			pernicious in nature. It gets a legal umbrella only if it is run
			<lb />
			or authorized by the State Govt. subject to the conditions
			<lb />
			enumerated under Section 4 of the Lotteries (Regulation)
			<lb />
			Act, 1998. It is a privilege of the State which can be
			<lb />
			partially parted to any other person subject to the
			<lb />
			performance of statutory conditions contained in the
			<lb />
			regulatory Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(b)
			<lb />
			Lottery has been declared to be falling within the
			<lb />
			expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot; by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in B. R. Enterprises v. State of U.P. &amp; Ors. :
			<lb />
			(1999) 9 SCC 700. The relevant observations are quoted
			<lb />
			hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 64. For this, we revert to scrutinize as to what made
			<lb />
			lotteries gambling and how State lotteries cleanses this
			<lb />
			character. As we have already recorded, the difference
			<lb />
			between gambling and trade is that gambling inherently
			<lb />
			contains a chance with no skill, while trade contains skill
			<lb />
			with no chance. What makes lottery pernicious is its
			<lb />
			gambling nature.
			<lb />
			Can it be said that in the State-
			<lb />
			organised lotteries this element of gambling is excluded?
			<lb />
			There could possibly be no two opinions that even in the
			<lb />
			State lotteries the same element of chance remains with
			<lb />
			no skill. It remains within the boundaries of gambling.
			<lb />
			The stringent measures and the conditions imposed under
			<lb />
			the State lotteries are only to inculcate faith in the
			<lb />
			participant of such lottery, that it is being conducted fairly
			<lb />
			with no possibility of fraud, misappropriation or deceit
			<lb />
			and assure the hopeful recipients of high prizes that all is
			<lb />
			fair and safe. That assurance if from stage one to the last
			<lb />
			with full transparency. No doubt, holding of the State
			<lb />
			lotteries for public revenue has been authorised, legalised
			<lb />
			and once this having been done it is expected from the
			<lb />
			State to take such measure to see that people at large,
			<lb />
			faithfully and hopefully participate in larger number for
			<lb />
			the greater yield of its revenue with no fear in their mind.
			<lb />
			The Act further ensures by virtue of Section 4(d) that the
			<lb />
			proceeds of the sale of such lottery tickets is credited to
			<lb />
			the public accounts of the State. This is to give clear
			<lb />
			message to the participants that the proceeds are not in
			<lb />
			the hands of an individual group or association but is
			<lb />
			ensured to be credited in the State accounts. But, as we
			<lb />
			have said, this by itself would not take it outside the
			<lb />
			realm of gambling. It remains within the same realm. In
			<lb />
			this regard, there is no difference between lotteries under
			<lb />
			Entry 34 List II and a lottery organised by the State
			<lb />
			under Entry 40 List I. when character of both the State-
			<lb />
			organised lotteries and other lotteries remains the same,
			<lb />
			by merely placing the apparel of the State with authority
			<lb />
			of law, would not make any difference; it remains
			<lb />
			gambling as element of chance persists with no element
			<lb />
			of skill. ……………….. &quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(c)
			<lb />
			A similar view has been expressed by the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in case of Union of India &amp; Ors. v. Martin
			<lb />
			Lottery Agencies Limited : (2009) 12 SCC 209. The
			<lb />
			relevant observations are reproduced hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 17. We fail to persuade ourselves to agree with the
			<lb />
			aforementioned submission. The law, as it stands today
			<lb />
			(although it is possible that this Court in future may take
			<lb />
			a different view), recognises lottery to be gambling.
			<lb />
			Gambling is res extra commercium as has been held by
			<lb />
			this Court in State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala
			<lb />
			and B.R. Enterprises v. State of U.P.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Thus, in view of the clear and categorical opinion of the Apex
			<lb />
			Court, we have no hesitation in saying that the conduct of
			<lb />
			lottery is an act of &quot;betting and gambling&quot; envisaged under
			<lb />
			entries 34 and 62 of List II to Schedule 7.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(ii) whether it is within the exclusive domain of State
			<lb />
			legislature to impose taxes on organising lotteries
			<lb />
			being an act of &quot;Betting and Gambling&quot;
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			(iii) whether the Parliament has the competence to
			<lb />
			enact law in exercise of its residuary legislative
			<lb />
			power under entry 97 of List I to Schedule 7
			<lb />
			dehors the entries 34 and 62 of List II;
			<lb />
			Since both these limbs are interrelated, the same are being
			<lb />
			taken up for consideration conjointly.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(d)
			<lb />
			Entry 34 of List II to Schedule 7 prescribes
			<lb />
			&quot;Betting and Gambling&quot; as a field of legislation within the
			<lb />
			domain of the State.
			<lb />
			Entry 40 also provides lotteries
			<lb />
			organized by the Government of India or the Government of
			<lb />
			a State as a field of legislation for which the Union
			<lb />
			legislature can enact a law. Entry 34 has much wider field
			<lb />
			and it may include many other activities apart from the
			<lb />
			lotteries for which the State legislature may enact a law.
			<lb />
			However, under entry 40 the Parliament is competent to
			<lb />
			enact law only in respect to lotteries as a species of betting
			<lb />
			and gambling. Lottery thus is a common subject matter for
			<lb />
			which both the Union Parliament and State Legislature can
			<lb />
			enact laws and fall in their respective legislative competence
			<lb />
			under Article 246 of the Constitution of India. The laws to
			<lb />
			be enacted under both these entries, however, could only be
			<lb />
			regulatory in nature and nothing beyond that. Where any
			<lb />
			field of legislation is available to both the Parliament and the
			<lb />
			legislature of a State and both the legislative bodies enact
			<lb />
			laws having competence to do so, in the event of conflict the
			<lb />
			State law to the extent of repugnancy shall be void if such
			<lb />
			law is enacted pursuant to any entry under List III
			<lb />
			(Concurrent List).
			<lb />
			However, the situation where the
			<lb />
			Parliament enacts a law on the subject matter under any
			<lb />
			one of the entries in List I and the State legislature also
			<lb />
			enacts a law touching the same subject matter pursuant to
			<lb />
			an entry in List II or vice versa, the position would be
			<lb />
			different. This seems to be the spirit underlying Article 246
			<lb />
			read with Article 254 of the Constitution of India subject to
			<lb />
			exceptions under various Articles in Part XI Chapter I. This
			<lb />
			should not detain us as admittedly the Parliament alone has
			<lb />
			enacted the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998 under entry 40
			<lb />
			and there is no corresponding law enacted by the State
			<lb />
			legislature under entry 34 in respect to the regulation of the
			<lb />
			lotteries. As noticed above power to regulate does not
			<lb />
			include power to tax, taxing powers having been conferred
			<lb />
			and specified under separate entries in Seventh Schedule.
			<lb />

			(e)
			<lb />
			In case of State of West Bengal &amp; Ors. v. Purvi
			<lb />
			Communication (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors. : (2005) 3 SCC 711, it
			<lb />
			has been held by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court that the power
			<lb />
			to regulate does not include power to tax. The relevant
			<lb />
			observations are noticed hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 35. The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act,
			<lb />
			1995, a Central legislation, has been enacted to regulate
			<lb />
			the operation of cable television networks in the country
			<lb />
			and for matters connected therewith. This enactment
			<lb />
			does not, in our opinion, fetter the legislative power or
			<lb />
			competence of the State to levy tax on luxuries including
			<lb />
			taxes on entertainments, amusements, betting and
			<lb />
			gambling falling under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule to the Constitution. The power of regulation or
			<lb />
			control under the said Central enactment is separate and
			<lb />
			distinct from the power of taxation by the State
			<lb />
			Legislature under Entry 62 of List II; being a specific
			<lb />
			power, the power of taxation cannot be cut down or
			<lb />
			fettered by the general power of regulation as exercised
			<lb />
			by Parliament in enacting the said 1995 Act. …………..
			<lb />
			…..……………………………………………………………………………………&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(f)
			<lb />
			Indubitably, there is no specific entry under List I
			<lb />
			empowering the Parliament to levy tax on lotteries or even
			<lb />
			on &quot;betting and gambling&quot;. The service tax sought to be
			<lb />
			imposed is in exercise of the residuary power vested in the
			<lb />
			Parliament under entry 97 of List I read with Article 248 of
			<lb />
			the Constitution of India. In so far the List II is concerned,
			<lb />
			entry 62 specifically provides for levy of taxes on &quot;betting
			<lb />
			and gambling&quot;. As observed by us above and held by
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in B.R. Enterprises and Martin
			<lb />
			Lottery Agencies Ltd. (supra), lottery does fall within the
			<lb />
			expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot;. The first question for
			<lb />
			consideration would be whether the power to impose tax on
			<lb />
			lotteries is same thing as to impose tax on &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;. Though no entry in any of the Lists to Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule specifically provides for levy of taxes on lotteries,
			<lb />
			the power to enact law for imposition of tax on lotteries have
			<lb />
			to be construed as inherent in the expressions &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;, lottery being one of such activity.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(g)
			<lb />
			Entry 97 of List I authorizes the Parliament to
			<lb />
			enact a law including for imposition of taxes in respect to
			<lb />
			any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III.
			<lb />
			Article 248, which is the source of power, confers exclusive
			<lb />
			jurisdiction upon the Parliament to make any law in respect
			<lb />
			to any matter not enumerated in &quot;State List&quot; or &quot;Concurrent
			<lb />
			List&quot; and under Sub-clause (2) such power also includes
			<lb />
			power to make law for imposition of tax not mentioned in
			<lb />
			either of those Lists, i.e. Lists II and III respectively.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(h)
			<lb />
			The scope of legislative competence of the
			<lb />
			Parliament to make laws under entry 97 of List I came up for
			<lb />
			consideration before a Constitution Bench of the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Union of India v. Shri Harbhajan
			<lb />
			Singh Dhillon : 1971 (2) SCC 779. In this case, vires of
			<lb />
			the Section 27 of the Finance Act, 1969, in so far it amended
			<lb />
			the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 so as to include the capital value
			<lb />
			of the agricultural land for purposes of commuting wealth
			<lb />
			came to be challenged as being beyond the exclusive
			<lb />
			competence of the Parliament.
			<lb />
			The petitioners, who
			<lb />
			challenged the vires of the Act, claimed that the power to
			<lb />
			tax on agricultural land was within the exclusive competence
			<lb />
			of the State Legislature under entry 49 of List II -i.e. Taxes
			<lb />
			on lands and buildings. It was held by the High Court and
			<lb />
			approved by the Apex Court that the power to levy tax on
			<lb />
			agricultural land is not contemplated by entry 49, List II.
			<lb />
			However, the amended Act was struck down by the High
			<lb />
			Court being beyond the competence of the Parliament by
			<lb />
			interpreting entry 86 of List I whereunder agricultural land
			<lb />
			was excluded from capital value of the assets.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			amendment brought by the Finance Act was claimed to be
			<lb />
			under the residuary power under entry 97, List I. While
			<lb />
			considering this question, the Constitution Bench of the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;10. It was further urged by Mr. Setalvad that the
			<lb />
			proper way of testing the validity of a parliamentary
			<lb />
			statute under our Constitution was first to see whether
			<lb />
			the parliamentary legislation was with respect to a matter
			<lb />
			or tax mentioned in List II, if it was not, no other question
			<lb />
			would arise. The learned counsel for the respondent
			<lb />
			contended tha this manner of enquiry had not been even
			<lb />
			hinted in any of the decisions of the Court during the last
			<lb />
			20 years of its existence and there must accordingly be
			<lb />
			something wrong with this test. He urged that in so far
			<lb />
			as this test is derived from the Canadian decisions, the
			<lb />
			Canadian Constitution is very different and those
			<lb />
			decisions ought not to be followed here and applied to our
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			11. It seems to us that the best way of dealing with the
			<lb />
			question of the validity of the impugned Act with the
			<lb />
			contentions of the parties is to ask ourselves two
			<lb />
			questions first is the impugned Act legislation with respect
			<lb />
			to Entry 49, List II and secondly if it is not, is it beyond
			<lb />
			the legislative competence of Parliament.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			12. We have put these questions in this order and in
			<lb />
			this form because we are definitely of the opinion, as
			<lb />
			explained a little later, that the scheme of our
			<lb />
			Constitution and the actual terms of the relevant
			<lb />
			articles, namely, Article 246, Article 248 and Entry 97,
			<lb />
			List I, show that any matter, including tax, which has
			<lb />
			not been allotted exclusively to the State Legislatures
			<lb />
			under List II or concurrently with Parliament under List
			<lb />
			III, falls within List I, including Entry 97 of that list
			<lb />
			read with Article 248.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………………………….
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			21. It seems to us that the function of Article
			<lb />
			246(1), read with Entries 1-96, List I, is to give
			<lb />
			positive power to Parliament to legislate in respect of
			<lb />
			these entries. Object is not to debar Parliament from
			<lb />
			legislating on a matter, even if other provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution enable it to do so. Accordingly we do not
			<lb />
			interpret the words &quot;any other matter&quot; occurring in
			<lb />
			Entry 97, List I, to mean a topic mentioned by way of
			<lb />
			exclusion. These words really refer to the matters
			<lb />
			contained in each of the Entries 1 to 96. The words
			<lb />
			&quot;any other matter&quot; had to be used because Entry 97,
			<lb />
			List I follows Entries 1-96, List I. It is true that the
			<lb />
			field of legislation is demarcated by Entries 1-96, List
			<lb />
			I, but demarcation does not mean that if Entry 97, List
			<lb />
			I confers, additional powers, we should refuse to give
			<lb />
			effect to it. At any rate, whatever doubt there may be
			<lb />
			on the interpretation of Entry 97, List I is removed by
			<lb />
			the wide terms of Article 248. It is framed in the
			<lb />
			widest possible terms. On its terms the only question
			<lb />
			to be asked is : Is the matter sought to be legislated
			<lb />
			or included in List II or in List III or is the tax sought
			<lb />
			to be levied mentioned in List II or in List III : No
			<lb />
			question has to be asked about List I. If the answer is
			<lb />
			in the negative then it follows that Parliament has
			<lb />
			power to make laws with respect to that matter of tax.

			47. The last sentence applies much more to the
			<lb />
			Constitution of a sovereign democratic republic. It is
			<lb />
			true that there are some limitations in Part III of the
			<lb />
			Constitution on the Legislatures in India but they are
			<lb />
			of a different character. They have nothing to do with
			<lb />
			legislative competence. If this is the true scope of
			<lb />
			residuary powers of Parliament, then we are unable to
			<lb />
			see why we should not, when dealing with a Central
			<lb />
			Act, enquire whether it is legislation in respect of any
			<lb />
			matter in List II for this is the only field regarding
			<lb />
			which there is a prohibition against Parliament. If a
			<lb />
			Central Act does not enter or invade these prohibited
			<lb />
			fields there is no point in trying to decide as to under
			<lb />
			which entry or entries of List I or List III a Central Act
			<lb />
			would rightly fit in.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			67. ………………………………. Be that as it may, we have
			<lb />
			the three lists and a residuary power and therefore it
			<lb />
			seems to us that in this context if a Central Act is
			<lb />
			challenged as being beyond the legislative competence
			<lb />
			of Parliament, it is enough to enquire if it is a law with
			<lb />
			respect to matters or taxes enumerated in List II. If it
			<lb />
			is not, no further question arises.

		<item>
			103. The expression &quot;any matter not enumerated in
			<lb />
			the Concurrent List or State List&quot; in Article 248 must
			<lb />
			mean, in the context of clause (1) of Article 246,
			<lb />
			which gives Parliament exclusive power in respect of
			<lb />
			matters in List I, any matter other than those
			<lb />
			enumerated in any of the three Lists. Obviously, the
			<lb />
			residuary power given to Parliament in Article 248
			<lb />
			cannot include power which is exclusively given to
			<lb />
			Parliament on matters in List I already conferred under
			<lb />
			clause (1) of Article 246, so that an attempt to
			<lb />
			distinguish the words &quot;any matter&quot; in Article 248 and
			<lb />
			&quot;any other matter&quot; in Entry 97 in List I is a distinction
			<lb />
			without difference. There had to be difference in
			<lb />
			language in the provisions in the context of the
			<lb />
			content of Entry 97 as that entry speaks about
			<lb />
			matters other than those enumerated before in List I
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			those
			<lb />
			enumerated
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			other
			<lb />
			Lists.
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding the fact that the residuary power has
			<lb />
			been vested in the Central Legislature under Article
			<lb />
			248 and its consequence translated in Entry 97 in List
			<lb />
			I, there can be no gainsaying that the idea was to
			<lb />
			assign such residuary power over matters which at the
			<lb />
			time of framing three Lists could not be thought of or
			<lb />
			contemplated. This is clear from the fact as pointed
			<lb />
			out by counsel, that the Lists contain as many as 209
			<lb />
			matters which are couched in careful and elaborate
			<lb />
			words with inclusive and excluding language in the
			<lb />
			case of some, which has made the Constitution, to use
			<lb />
			the words of Gwyer, C.J., in In re the C. P. and Berar
			<lb />
			Act No.XIV of 1938 (supra), &quot;unique among federal
			<lb />
			constitutions in the length and detail of its legislative
			<lb />
			Lists&quot;.
			<lb />
			In the layout of such elaborately worded
			<lb />
			matters in the Lists and in the context of Article
			<lb />
			246(1), the residuary power contained in Article 248
			<lb />
			and Entry 97, List I must be construed as meaning
			<lb />
			power in respect of matters not enumerated in any of
			<lb />
			the three Lists.
			<lb />
			Such a residuary power cannot,
			<lb />
			therefore, be ordinarily claimed in respect of a matter
			<lb />
			already dealt with under an article or an entry in any
			<lb />
			one of the three Lists.&quot;

			Article 265 mandates -no tax shall be
			<lb />
			levied or collected except by authority of law. The
			<lb />
			scheme of the Seventh Schedule reveals an
			<lb />
			exhaustive enumeration of legislative subjects,
			<lb />
			considerably
			<lb />
			enlarged
			<lb />
			over
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			predecessor
			<lb />
			Government of India Act. Entry 97 in List I confers
			<lb />
			residuary powers on Parliament. Article 248 of the

			Constitution which speaks of residuary powers of
			<lb />
			legislation confers exclusive power on Parliament to
			<lb />
			make any law with respect to any matter not

			<lb />
			At the same time, it provides that such residuary
			<lb />

			imposing a tax not mentioned in either of those Lists.
			<lb />
			It is, thus, clear that if any power to tax is clearly

		<item>
			&quot;22.194.
			<lb />
			Does Article 248 add anything
			<lb />
			to the exclusive residuary power of Parliament
			<lb />
			under Article 246(1) read with Entry 97 List I, to

			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(k)
			<lb />
			The Hon&apos;ble Court further observed that there is
			<lb />
			nothing like an implied power to tax and the burden is
			<lb />
			always upon the taxing authority to point to the act of
			<lb />
			assembly which authorizes the imposition of the tax claimed.
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Court further relied upon Justice G.P. Singh&apos;s
			<lb />
			commentary on Principles of Statutory Interpretation (8 th
			<lb />
			Edn., 2001).
			<lb />
			The relevant quotes are reproduced
			<lb />

		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;106. The judicial opinion of binding authority flowing
			<lb />
			from several pronouncements of this Court has settled
			<lb />
			these principles : (i) in interpreting a taxing statute,
			<lb />
			equitable considerations are entirely out of place. Taxing
			<lb />
			statutes cannot be interpreted on any presumption or
			<lb />
			assumption. A taxing statute has to be interpreted in the
			<lb />
			light of what is clearly expressed; it cannot imply
			<lb />
			anything which is not expressed; it cannot import
			<lb />
			provisions in the statute so as to supply any deficiency;
			<lb />
			(ii) before taxing any person it must be shown that he
			<lb />
			falls within the ambit of the charging section by clear
			<lb />
			words used in the section; and (iii) if the words are
			<lb />
			ambiguous and open to two interpretations, the benefit of
			<lb />
			interpretation is given to the subject. There is nothing
			<lb />
			unjust in the taxpayer escaping if the letter of the law
			<lb />
			fails to catch him on account of the legislature&apos;s failure to
			<lb />
			express itself clearly. (See Justice G. P. Singh, ibid., pp.
			<lb />
			638-39.)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			107. Power to tax is not an incidental power. According
			<lb />
			to Seervai, although legislative power includes all
			<lb />
			incidental and subsidiary power, the power to impose a
			<lb />
			tax is not such a power under our Constitution. It is for
			<lb />
			this reason that it was held that the power to legislate in
			<lb />
			respect to inter-State trade and commerce (Entry 42 List
			<lb />
			I Schedule 7) did not carry with it the power to tax the
			<lb />
			sale of goods in inter-State trade and commerce before
			<lb />
			the insertion of Entry 92-A in List I and such power
			<lb />
			belonged to the States under Entry 54 in List II. Entry 97
			<lb />
			in List I also militated against the contention that the
			<lb />
			power to tax is an incidental power under our Constitution
			<lb />
			(See Seervai, H.M. : Constitutional Law of India, 4 th /Silver
			<lb />
			Jubilee Edn., Vol. 3, para 22.20.)&quot;

			In N. V. Marketing Pvt. Ltd. v. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra &amp; Ors. : 2009 (III) (8) Bom. L.R. 3397, it
			<lb />
			has been ruled that even though the power of regulation of
			<lb />
			lotteries vest in the Parliament in terms of entry 40 of List I,
			<lb />
			power to tax is not incidental power. The Hon&apos;ble Bombay
			<lb />
			High Court relying upon West Bengal v. Kesoram
			<lb />
			Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. : (2004) 10 SCC 201 and various
			<lb />
			other judgments, while considering the validity of State law
			<lb />
			enacted by the Maharashtra State imposing tax on lotteries,
			<lb />
			observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;3. It is the contention of the Petitioners that the
			<lb />
			legislature of State of Maharashtra has no legislative
			<lb />
			power to enact Laws relating to State Lotteries including
			<lb />
			Laws relating to taxation, and therefore, according to the
			<lb />
			Petitioners, the State Act is beyond the legislative
			<lb />
			competence of the legislature of State of Maharashtra.
			<lb />
			The second submission is that the enactment of the State
			<lb />
			Act is colourable exercise of the legislative power in as
			<lb />
			much as it is another method of levying tax on lottery
			<lb />
			tickets. The third submission is that the State Act seeks
			<lb />
			to levy tax on lottery schemes, tax is collected in advance
			<lb />
			in respect of each draw in the lottery scheme at the rate
			<lb />
			specified in Section 3 of the State Act. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that lottery scheme of all other State organising and
			<lb />
			conducting lotteries save and except that of Maharashtra
			<lb />
			are formulated outside the State of Maharashtra and
			<lb />
			therefore, the law has extra territorial application. The
			<lb />
			fourth submission is that the State Act levies tax on
			<lb />
			lottery schemes but the term &quot;lottery scheme&quot; is not
			<lb />
			defined anywhere and therefore, it is violative of
			<lb />
			guarantee under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It
			<lb />
			was also contended that the State Act has been enacted
			<lb />
			to impose tax on sale of lottery tickets conducted by
			<lb />
			other State in State of Maharashtra so as to make selling
			<lb />
			of lottery tickets by the other States uneconomical,
			<lb />
			unviable and thereby creating monopoly in the lottery
			<lb />
			tickets of the lotteries conducted by the State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra.

			10. It was then contended before us that though there
			<lb />
			is specific power vested in the State legislature under
			<lb />
			Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule, because of
			<lb />
			Entry 40 in List I of the Seventh Schedule of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India, the Parliament will have legislative
			<lb />
			competence to levy tax under Article 248 and Entry 97 in
			<lb />
			List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of
			<lb />
			India. In our opinion, this submission has also no force,
			<lb />
			because power to tax is not an incidental power and
			<lb />
			under the residuary power the Parliament will be entitled
			<lb />
			to impose tax only if that power is not specifically vested
			<lb />
			in the State legislature by any entry in List II of the
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule. ……..&quot;

			<lb />
			the legislative power of State under entry 62 of List II, held
			<lb />
			as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;46. Therefore, taxing entries must be construed with
			<lb />
			clarity and precision so as to maintain such exclusivity,
			<lb />
			and a construction of a taxation entry which may lead to
			<lb />
			overlapping must be eschewed. If the taxing power is
			<lb />
			within a particular legislative field, it would follow that
			<lb />
			other fields in the legislative lists must be construed to
			<lb />
			exclude this field so that there is no possibility of
			<lb />
			legislative trespass.

			49. Under the three lists of the Seventh Schedule to
			<lb />
			the Indian Constitution a taxation entry in a legislative list
			<lb />
			may be with respect to both. Article 246 makes it clear
			<lb />
			that the exclusive powers conferred on Parliament or the
			<lb />
			States to legislate on a particular matter includes the
			<lb />
			power to legislate with respect to that matter. Hence,
			<lb />
			where the entry describes an object to tax, all taxable
			<lb />
			events pertaining to the object are within that field of
			<lb />
			legislation unless the even is specifically provided for
			<lb />
			elsewhere under a different legislative head. Where there
			<lb />
			is the possibility of legislative overlap, courts have
			<lb />
			resolved the issue according to settled principles of
			<lb />
			construction of entries in the legislative lists.

			72. In view of the decision in Sea Customs Act case
			<lb />
			the second premise propounded by Mr. Salve is
			<lb />
			unacceptable. As we have seen, in that case this
			<lb />
			Court held that the taxable event of ownership is
			<lb />
			implicit in the concept of taxes on goods. That the
			<lb />
			entries on taxable events in the legislative lists are not
			<lb />
			exhaustive is also recognized and provided for in
			<lb />
			Article 248(2) which provides for the power of
			<lb />
			Parliament to make any law imposing a tax not
			<lb />
			mentioned in either the Concurrent or State Lists.
			<lb />
			This residuary power is reflected in Entry 97 of List I.
			<lb />
			Furthermore if an article or goods are taxable only
			<lb />
			with respect to a taxable event, and if, as contended
			<lb />
			by Mr. Salve, all taxable events have been provided
			<lb />
			for in the different legislative heads, then by that
			<lb />
			token no object or goods could be taxable. This would
			<lb />
			render the various entries in the State List including
			<lb />
			Entries 57 and 58 contentless. As we cannot accept
			<lb />
			that the taxation entries exhaustively enumerate all
			<lb />
			taxable events, it does not follow that Entry 62 of List
			<lb />
			II does not cover goods. It is not possible therefore to
			<lb />
			hold merely on such a construction of the legislative
			<lb />
			lists and the taxation entries therein, that Entry 62 List
			<lb />
			II does not permit the States to levy tax on articles of
			<lb />
			luxury.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			73. Having rejected the second premise
			<lb />
			contended for by Mr. Salve, the next question is
			<lb />
			whether the language of Entry 62 List II would resolve
			<lb />
			the issue. The juxtaposition of the different taxes
			<lb />
			within Entry 62 itself is in our view of particular
			<lb />
			significance. The entry speaks of &quot;taxes on luxuries
			<lb />
			including taxes on entertainments, amusements,
			<lb />
			betting and gambling&quot;. The word &quot;including must be
			<lb />
			given some meaning. In ordinary parlance it indicates
			<lb />
			that what follows the word &quot;including&quot; comprises or is
			<lb />
			contained in or is a part of the whole of the work
			<lb />
			preceding. The nature of the included items would not
			<lb />
			only partake of the character of the whole, but may be
			<lb />
			construed as clarificatory of the whole.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			74. It has also been held that the word
			<lb />
			&quot;includes&quot; may in certain contexts be a word of
			<lb />
			limitation (South Gujarat Roofing Tiles Manufacturers
			<lb />
			Assn. v. State of Gujarat). In the context of Entry 62
			<lb />
			of List II this would not mean that the word &quot;luxuries&quot;
			<lb />
			would be restricted to entertainments, amusements,
			<lb />
			betting and gambling but would only emphasise the
			<lb />
			attribute which is common to the group. If luxuries is
			<lb />
			understood as meaning something which is purely for
			<lb />
			enjoyment and beyond the necessities of life, there
			<lb />
			can be no doubt that entertainments, amusements,
			<lb />
			betting and gambling would come within such
			<lb />
			understanding.
			<lb />
			Additionally,
			<lb />
			entertainments,
			<lb />
			amusements, betting and gambling arfe all activities.
			<lb />
			&quot;Luxuries&quot; is also capable of meaning an activity and
			<lb />
			has primarily and traditionally been defined as such.
			<lb />
			It is only derivatively and recently used to connote an
			<lb />
			article of luxury. One can assume that the coupling of
			<lb />
			these taxes under one entry was not fortuitous but
			<lb />
			because of these common characteristics.&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>
			(n)
			<lb />
			It has been vehemently argued by Mr. Razzaq that
			<lb />
			the service tax levied vide clause (zzzzn) under sub-section
			<lb />
			(105) of Section 65 is a tax on various activities comprising
			<lb />
			services rendered by the distributors to the State in
			<lb />
			promotion, marketing, organizing of lottery, etc. It is not a
			<lb />
			tax on betting and gambling, per se and is beyond the
			<lb />
			purview of entry 62 of List II.
			<lb />
			The entry 62 empowers the State Legislature to
			<lb />
			impose tax on luxuries, entertainment, amusement, betting
			<lb />
			and gambling.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(o)
			<lb />
			For the purpose of the present petition, the
			<lb />
			relevant subject matter under entry 62 is &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot;.
			<lb />
			As held by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Express Hotels Private Ltd. v. State of Gujarat &amp; Anr. :
			<lb />
			(1989) 3 SCC 677, the entries must be construed in the
			<lb />
			widest possible meaning. Relevant observations are:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;15. …………………….The entries should not be read in a
			<lb />
			narrow or pedantic sense but must be given their fullest
			<lb />
			meaning and the widest amplitude and be held to extend
			<lb />
			to all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and
			<lb />
			reasonably be said to be comprehended in them.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			In the same judgment the vires of various provisions
			<lb />
			enacted by States of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and
			<lb />
			West Bengal, imposing taxes on luxuries provided in hotels
			<lb />
			and lodging houses came to be challenged. The question
			<lb />
			arose whether the luxury taxes can be levied only on the
			<lb />
			articles of luxury or persons enjoying the luxuries under
			<lb />
			entry 62 and the activity of lodging in a hotel or lodge being
			<lb />
			not a thing tangible the tax is ultra vires the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Interpreting the scope of legislative entry particularly the
			<lb />
			expression &apos;luxury&apos; used in entry 62, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;21. The concept of a tax on &apos;luxuries&apos; in Entry 62, List II
			<lb />
			cannot be limited merely to tax things tangible and corporeal in
			<lb />
			their aspect as &apos;luxuries&apos;. It is true that while frugal or simple
			<lb />
			food and medicine may be classified as necessities; articles
			<lb />
			such as jewellery, perfume, intoxicating liquor, tobacco, etc.,
			<lb />
			could be called articles of luxury. But the legislative entry
			<lb />
			cannot be exhausted by these cases, illustrative of the concept.
			<lb />
			The entry encompasses all the manifestations or emanations,
			<lb />
			the notion of &apos;luxuries&apos; can fairly and reasonably (sic) can be
			<lb />
			said to comprehend the element of extravagance or indulgence
			<lb />
			that differentiates &apos;luxury&apos; from &apos;necessity&apos; cannot be confined
			<lb />
			to goods and articles. There can be elements of extravagance
			<lb />
			or indulgence in the quality of services and activities.&quot;

			In
			<lb />
			State
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Bombay
			<lb />
			vs.
			<lb />
			R.M.D.
			<lb />
			Chamarbaugwala and another : AIR 1957SC 699, tax
			<lb />
			was levied under entry 62 on the promoters of the lotteries.
			<lb />
			The question that fell for consideration was whether tax on
			<lb />
			promoters of lotteries, who do not gamble is tax on betting
			<lb />
			and gambling under entry 62 List II. Rejecting the challenge
			<lb />
			and upholding the validity of the levy on promoters, the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(23) The next point urged is that although the Act may
			<lb />
			come under Entry 34, the taxing provisions of s. 12A
			<lb />
			cannot be said to impose a tax on betting and gambling
			<lb />
			under Entry 62 but imposes tax on trade under Entry 60.
			<lb />
			Once it is held that the impugned Act is on the topic of
			<lb />
			betting and gambling under Entry 34, the tax imposed by
			<lb />
			such a statute, one would think, would be a tax on
			<lb />
			betting and gambling under Entry 62. The Appeal Court
			<lb />
			has expressed the view that s. 12A does not fall within
			<lb />
			Entry 62, for it does not impose a tax on the gambler but
			<lb />
			imposes a tax on the petitioners who do not themselves
			<lb />
			gamble but who only promote the prize competitions. So
			<lb />
			far as the promoters are concerned, the tax levied from
			<lb />
			them can only be regarded as tax on the trade of prize
			<lb />
			competitions carried on by them.
			<lb />
			This, with respect, is taking a very narrow view of
			<lb />
			the matter. Entry 62 talks of taxes on betting and
			<lb />
			gambling and not of taxes on the men who bet or
			<lb />
			gamble. It is necessary, therefore, to bear in mind the
			<lb />
			real nature of the tax. The tax imposed by s. 12A is, in
			<lb />
			terms, a percentage of the sums specified in the
			<lb />
			declaration made under s. 15 by the promoter or a lump
			<lb />
			sum having regard to the circulation and distribution of
			<lb />
			the news paper or publication in the State.

			If taxation on betting and gambling is to be
			<lb />
			regarded as a means of controlling betting and gambling
			<lb />
			activities, then the easiest and surest way of doing so is
			<lb />
			to get at the promoters who encourage and promote the
			<lb />
			unsocial activities and who hold the gamblers&apos; money in
			<lb />
			their hands. To collect the tax from the promoters is not
			<lb />
			to tax the promoters but is a convenient way of imposing
			<lb />
			the tax on betting and gambling and indirectly taxing the
			<lb />
			gamblers themselves.

			(q)
			<lb />
			In Purvi Communication (P) Ltd. (supra)
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court considered the scope of Entry 62
			<lb />
			and held that the tax under this Entry may be levied on the
			<lb />
			person spending on entertainment, on the act of person
			<lb />
			entertaining or subject of entertainment.
			<lb />
			Relevant
			<lb />
			observations are quoted hereunder: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;38. A tax under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule to the Constitution may be imposed not only on
			<lb />
			the person spending on entertainment but also on the act
			<lb />
			of a person entertaining, or the subject of entertainment.
			<lb />
			It is well settled by this Court that such tax may be levied
			<lb />
			on the person offering or providing entertainment or the
			<lb />
			person enjoying it.
			<lb />
			The respondents are admittedly
			<lb />
			engaged in the business of receiving broadcast signals
			<lb />
			and then instantaneously sending or transmitting such
			<lb />
			visual or audio-visual signals by coaxial cable, to
			<lb />
			subscribers&apos; homes through their various franchisees. It
			<lb />
			has been made possible for the individual subscribers to
			<lb />
			choose the desired channels on their individual TV sets
			<lb />
			because of cable television technology of the respondents
			<lb />
			and of sending the visual or audio-viisual signals to sub-
			<lb />
			cable operators, and instantly retransmitting such signals
			<lb />
			to individual subscribers for entertaining them through
			<lb />
			their franchisees. The respondents&apos; act is, no doubt, an
			<lb />
			act of offering entertainment to the subscribers and/or
			<lb />
			viewers.
			<lb />
			The respondent is very much directly and
			<lb />
			closely involved in the act of offering or providing
			<lb />
			entertainment to subscribers who are on his record. For
			<lb />
			the fact of offering or providing entertainment to the
			<lb />
			subscribers and/or viewers, the respondents receive
			<lb />
			charges, which are realized or collected by their
			<lb />
			franchisee from the ultimate subscribers.
			<lb />
			Their
			<lb />
			franchisee, called as sub-cable operator under the said
			<lb />
			1982 Act having no independent role to ofer or provide
			<lb />
			entertainments to
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			subscribers inasmuch as
			<lb />
			franchisees have to depend entirely on the respondents&apos;
			<lb />
			communication network and this communication network
			<lb />
			of the respondents consists of receiving and sending
			<lb />
			visual images and audio and other information for
			<lb />
			preparation of the subscribers and/or viewers; without
			<lb />
			the communication network service of the respondents,
			<lb />
			no entertainments can be offered or provided to the
			<lb />
			subscribers and/or viewers.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			39. In the tax matters, the State Legislature is free, if
			<lb />
			it has legislative competence, to choose the persons from
			<lb />
			whom the tax levied on entertainments is to be collected.
			<lb />
			In other words, what are taxed are the entertainments,
			<lb />
			which is very much within the ambit of Entry 62 of List II
			<lb />
			of the Seventh Schedule. It is the respondents who as
			<lb />
			cable operator for the purpose of the said 1982 Act are
			<lb />
			engaged in the business of providing or offering
			<lb />
			entertainments which include showing of films, various
			<lb />
			serials, cricket matches and dramatic performances to the
			<lb />
			subscribers, and the tax is imposed on the act of offering
			<lb />
			such entertainments in this way to such subscribers
			<lb />
			and/or viewers.
			<lb />
			The entire communication network
			<lb />
			service is built up and controlled by the respondents.
			<lb />
			Whatever amount is received or receivable by the
			<lb />
			respondent in respect of providing such entertainments is
			<lb />
			taxable under sub-section (4-a) of Section 4-A of the said
			<lb />
			1982 Act which has a direct and sufficient nexus with the
			<lb />
			entertainments.&quot;

			Similarly entry 50 under Section 100 of the

			<lb />
			Constitution Bench of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in 1959
			<lb />
			Supp (2) SCR 63=AIR 1959 SC 582 : Western India
			<lb />

			<lb />
			to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can
			<lb />
			fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(s)
			<lb />
			In the matter of organizing, marketing and
			<lb />
			promotion of lotteries, the State Government who is the
			<lb />
			promoter and publisher of the lotteries, the distributor, i.e.
			<lb />
			the petitioner, selling agent and the ultimate purchaser of
			<lb />
			the lottery ticket who participates in the game of chance are
			<lb />
			all players in the activity of the betting and gambling. Thus
			<lb />
			tax envisaged under entry 62 on &quot;betting and gambling&quot; is
			<lb />
			tax on the activity as held by the Constitution Bench in
			<lb />
			State of Bombay vs. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala&apos;s case
			<lb />
			(supra).
			<lb />
			The betting and gambling itself is an activity
			<lb />
			though the lottery ticket is a tangible thing which carries
			<lb />
			with its right to participate in the game of chance. Thus all
			<lb />
			activities right from the publishing of the lottery tickets till
			<lb />
			participation in the game of chance, declaration of draw and
			<lb />
			even distribution of prize to the winner fall within the
			<lb />
			purview of expression &apos;betting and gambling&apos;. Thus power
			<lb />
			to levy tax on organization, promotion and marketing of
			<lb />
			lottery being an act of betting and gambling comes within
			<lb />
			the exclusive domain of entry 62 of List II.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(t)
			<lb />
			It is also settled legal position that where the
			<lb />
			entries under different Lists empower the respective
			<lb />
			legislatures to enact law on any subject matter and the
			<lb />
			question arises regarding the legislative competence of the
			<lb />
			legislative bodies, the doctrine of pith and substance is to be
			<lb />
			applied to find out the real intention of the legislative entry
			<lb />
			and the object of enacting a law. As observed in State of
			<lb />
			West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (supra) if any
			<lb />
			law enacted by Parliament is not traceable in any legislative
			<lb />
			entry in List II or List III, it is irrelevant whether the power
			<lb />
			of the Parliament is traceable to a specific entry and
			<lb />
			Parliament shall be deemed to have legislative competence.
			<lb />
			Its natural corollary would be if power to enact law on a
			<lb />
			subject matter including levy of taxes is traceable to any
			<lb />
			entry in List II and List III, residuary power under entry 97
			<lb />
			of List I read with Article 248 of the Constitution of India will
			<lb />
			not be available to it, the same having been specifically
			<lb />
			restricted under entry 97 of List I and Article 248 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(u)
			<lb />
			In the instant case, the power to tax on lotteries
			<lb />
			or even &quot;betting and gambling&quot; is not available under any of
			<lb />
			the entries of List I. However, such power is germane to
			<lb />
			and emanates from entry 62 of List II in Seventh Schedule,
			<lb />
			meaning thereby that the residuary power to enact a law
			<lb />
			imposing tax on lotteries would not be available to the
			<lb />
			Parliament.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			Mr. Razzak, Learned Additional Solicitor General,
			<lb />
			submits that since the service tax is a new concept and a
			<lb />
			new tax regime, it could not be said that at the time of
			<lb />
			enacting the entries the intention of the Framers of the
			<lb />
			Constitution was to include all kind of future taxes within the
			<lb />
			purview of taxes under entry 62 or for that matter any other
			<lb />
			entry in Seventh Schedule, wherein the power to enact a law
			<lb />
			imposing taxes has been indicated. His submission is that
			<lb />
			service tax is not mentioned in any of the entries and thus it
			<lb />
			should be deemed to be excluded from the entry 62 or for
			<lb />
			that matter any other entry in Lists II and III to Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule.
			<lb />
			This argument apparently appears to be
			<lb />
			attractive but its fallacy is exposed if the proposition is
			<lb />
			applied to all taxing entries irrespective of Lists. On the
			<lb />
			same analogy, the power to impose a tax not prevalent or
			<lb />
			envisaged when entry 97 was incorporated in List I, the
			<lb />
			service tax would also be beyond its purview. &quot;Tax&quot; has
			<lb />
			been defined under the Black&apos;s Law Dictionary in the
			<lb />
			following manner: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;tax, n.
			<lb />
			A monetary charge imposed by the
			<lb />
			government on persons, entitles, transactions, or
			<lb />
			property to yield public revenue. • Most broadly, the term
			<lb />
			embraces all governmental impositions on the person,
			<lb />
			property, privileges, occupations, and enjoyment of the
			<lb />
			people, and includes duties, imposts, and excises.
			<lb />
			Although a tax is often thought of as being pecuniary in
			<lb />
			nature, it is not necessarily payable in money.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(w)
			<lb />
			Article 366 of the Constitution of India defines
			<lb />
			various expressions used in the Constitution. &quot;Taxation and
			<lb />
			Tax&quot; being one of such expressions defined under clause
			<lb />
			(28) thereof. The relevant extract reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 366.
			<lb />
			Definitions.-In
			<lb />
			this Constitution, unless the
			<lb />
			context otherwise requires, the following expressions
			<lb />
			have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them,
			<lb />
			that is to say -
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
			…………………………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(28) &quot;taxation&quot; includes the imposition of any tax or
			<lb />
			impost, whether general or local or special, and &quot;tax&quot;
			<lb />
			shall be construed accordingly;
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
			…………………………………………………………………………………&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(x)
			<lb />
			This definition is of widest possible amplitude and
			<lb />
			encompasses within its field any kind of tax that could be
			<lb />
			visualized or conceptualized. In D. G. Gose and Co. Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. State of Kerala &amp; Anr. : (1980) 2 SCC
			<lb />
			410, a Constitution Bench of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			while considering clause (28) of Article 366 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5. The word &quot;tax&quot; in its widest sense includes all
			<lb />
			money raised by taxation. It therefore includes taxes
			<lb />
			levied by the Central and the State legislatures, and also
			<lb />
			those known as &quot;rates&quot;, or other charges, levied by local
			<lb />
			authorities under statutory powers. &quot;Taxation&quot; has
			<lb />
			therefore been defined in clause (28) of Article 366 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution to include &quot;the imposition of any tax or
			<lb />
			impost, whether general or local or special&quot;, and it has
			<lb />
			been
			<lb />
			directed
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			&quot;tax&quot;
			<lb />
			shall
			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			&quot;construed
			<lb />
			accordingly&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(y)
			<lb />
			Various entries empowering the Parliament and
			<lb />
			State Legislatures to enact laws for levy of tax do not mean
			<lb />
			or confine the kind of taxes prevalent or invogue at the time
			<lb />
			these entries were enacted in Seventh Schedule. The word
			<lb />
			&quot;tax&quot; includes all kinds of taxation present or future that
			<lb />
			may be thought of by the competent legislative body. Thus
			<lb />
			the argument of Mr. Razzak that service tax does not find
			<lb />
			mention in entry 62 and thus is beyond its purview cannot
			<lb />
			be accepted or appreciated. Any kind of tax that may be
			<lb />
			envisaged and can be legally conceptualized by the
			<lb />
			legislative body falls within the purview of tax in view of all
			<lb />
			embracing definition of expressions &quot;tax (taxation)&quot; under
			<lb />
			clause (28) of Article 366. Service tax though a new regime
			<lb />
			but it would be antithesis of the term &quot;tax&quot; if considered to
			<lb />
			be a category of tax not envisaged by any of the entries in
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule empowering to levy tax. Applying the
			<lb />
			principle of pith and substance, the power to levy tax on
			<lb />
			lottery being a game of chance and included in the
			<lb />
			expressions &quot;betting and gambling&quot; in entry 62 List II, the
			<lb />
			State Legislature has the exclusive legislative competence
			<lb />
			and jurisdiction of Parliament to levy such a tax in exercise
			<lb />
			of its residuary power under entry 97 of the List I read with
			<lb />
			Article 248 of the Constitution shall stand excluded. There is
			<lb />
			another important aspect; entry 92C -&apos;Taxes on services&apos;
			<lb />
			was also incorporated in List I Seventh Schedule by Eighty-
			<lb />
			eighth Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003. However, this
			<lb />
			entry has not been notified till date.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(z)
			<lb />
			Our opinion that the Parliament lacks legislative
			<lb />
			competence to levy service tax on lotteries in exercise of its
			<lb />
			legislative power flowing from entry 97 List I read with
			<lb />
			Article 248 of the Constitution should not be construed to
			<lb />
			mean that the Parliament has no jurisdiction whatsoever to
			<lb />
			levy service tax in respect to any of the subject matter. The
			<lb />
			legislative competence of the Parliament to impose service
			<lb />
			tax has to be conceded by virtue of entry 97 List I read with
			<lb />
			Article 248 of the Constitution as held by Hon&apos;ble Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in various judgments noticed by us hereinbefore and
			<lb />
			later part of this judgment. However, such legislative power
			<lb />
			is prohibited in respect to any subject matter where the
			<lb />
			power to impose or levy tax has been conferred upon the
			<lb />
			State Legislature in List II (State List) or the Provincial
			<lb />
			Legislature and the Parliament under List III (Concurrent
			<lb />
			List). It is also pertinent to say that Parliament would also
			<lb />
			be deprived of the residuary power in respect to any subject
			<lb />
			matter falling even in the List I where such power is
			<lb />
			traceable to any of the entries contained therein i.e. entries
			<lb />
			1 to 96. It would not be improper to say that the residuary
			<lb />
			power of the Parliament would come into life only where
			<lb />
			none of the entries in any of the Lists provide for legislative
			<lb />
			field. However, as interpreted by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in
			<lb />
			State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd.
			<lb />
			(supra), the only embargo on exercise of the residuary
			<lb />
			power of Parliament under entry 97 List I read with Article
			<lb />
			248 of the Constitution would be non-existence of legislative
			<lb />
			power of any of the Legislatures under Lists II and III,
			<lb />
			Schedule 7. At the cost of repetition we may say that where
			<lb />
			the legislative power whether to enact a law in general or for
			<lb />
			levy of tax is not envisaged under Lists II and III, the
			<lb />
			Parliament would be fully competent to enact a law including
			<lb />
			imposing a tax (Service Tax) under entry 97 List I. We are
			<lb />
			of the considered view that Parliament would have
			<lb />
			legislative competence to impose tax including service tax
			<lb />
			upon lotteries but for entry 62, List II. It is the exclusive
			<lb />
			legislative domain of the State Legislature to levy tax of any
			<lb />
			nature on lotteries by virtue of entry 62 List II, Schedule 7.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(iv) whether the State legislature and Parliament both
			<lb />
			can simultaneously impose taxes on the conduct
			<lb />
			of lottery by the State Government under entry 62
			<lb />
			of List II and entry 97 of List I to Schedule 7, if so,
			<lb />
			under what circumstances;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(aa)
			<lb />
			Mr. Farooq Md. Razzak, Addl. Solicitor General,
			<lb />
			appearing for the Union of India, submits that the service
			<lb />
			tax levied vide the impugned clause (zzzzn) to Sub-section
			<lb />
			(105) of Section 65 is not a tax on the activity of &quot;betting
			<lb />
			and gambling&quot; but on services like promotion, marketing,
			<lb />
			organising or in any other manner assisting in organising
			<lb />
			games of chance including lottery. His further submission is
			<lb />
			that the service tax is on an activity and is a Value Addition
			<lb />
			Tax. To explain his contention it is stated that the value
			<lb />
			addition is on account of activity like marketing, organising
			<lb />
			and promoting the lottery and such activity renders value
			<lb />
			addition to the lotteries held by the State of Sikkim and,
			<lb />
			thus, does not fall within the purview of &quot;betting and
			<lb />
			gambling&quot; in entry 62 of List II. His submission is that on
			<lb />
			account of non-application of entry 62, the Parliament is
			<lb />
			entitled to exercise its legislative jurisdiction to enact the
			<lb />
			law under its residuary power under entry 97 of List I.
			<lb />
			According to Mr. Razzak, a lottery ticket of Re.1/-is being
			<lb />
			given to the petitioner&apos;s company for 70 paise for providing
			<lb />
			various services as noticed by us in the earlier part of this
			<lb />
			judgment and the service tax is chargeable on the gross
			<lb />
			amount of the lottery tickets under Section 67 of the Finance
			<lb />
			Act, 1994 as amended by Finance Act, 2010. It is further
			<lb />
			argued that the measure of tax cannot be questioned by the
			<lb />
			petitioner that too in writ proceedings and it is for the
			<lb />
			competent adjudicating authority to decide the issue. It is
			<lb />
			contended that the petitioner has straight way approached
			<lb />
			this Court without having approached the competent
			<lb />
			adjudicating authority in this regard.
			<lb />
			Under such
			<lb />
			circumstances, the petitioner should be directed to approach
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			competent
			<lb />
			adjudicating
			<lb />
			authority
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			seeking
			<lb />
			adjudication regarding levy of service tax on the service
			<lb />
			rendered by it. He has placed reliance upon the judgment of
			<lb />
			the Apex Court reported as Association of Leasing &amp;
			<lb />
			Financial Service Companies v. Union of India : (2011)
			<lb />
			2 SCC 352.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ab)
			<lb />
			In the above case the controversy before the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court was with regard to levy of service
			<lb />
			tax on the transaction of equipment leasing and hire
			<lb />
			purchases undertaken by non-banking financial companies.
			<lb />
			The plea of the writ petitioners who challenged the vires of
			<lb />
			the levy was that the transaction of equipment leasing and
			<lb />
			hire purchase and financing has been constitutionally
			<lb />
			defined as sale and purchase under Article 366 (29A) and
			<lb />
			thus falls within the exclusive competence of State
			<lb />
			Legislature under entry 54 of List II, hence the Parliament in
			<lb />
			exercise of its legislative competence under entry 97 of List I
			<lb />
			of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is not competent to
			<lb />
			levy service tax. Hon&apos;ble Apex Court on consideration of
			<lb />
			entire issue came to the conclusion that part of the
			<lb />
			transaction constitute sale for which the State Legislature is
			<lb />
			competent to impose tax under entry 54 of List II whereas
			<lb />
			the components of the transaction constituting service fall
			<lb />
			within the legislative competence of the Parliament under its
			<lb />
			residuary power under entry 97 of List I.
			<lb />
			Validity of the
			<lb />
			service tax imposed under Section 65(105)(zm) has been
			<lb />
			upheld. The relevant observations in this regard are quoted
			<lb />
			hereunder:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;59. Applying the above decisions to the present case,
			<lb />
			on examination of the impugned legislation in its entirety,
			<lb />
			we are of the view that the impugned levy relates to or is
			<lb />
			with respect to the particular topic of &quot;banking and other
			<lb />
			financial services&quot; which includes within it one of the
			<lb />
			several enumerated services viz. financial leasing
			<lb />
			services. These include long-term financing by banks and
			<lb />
			other financial institutions (including NBFCs). These are
			<lb />
			services rendered to their customers which comes within
			<lb />
			the meaning of the expression &quot;taxable services&quot; as
			<lb />
			defined in Section 65(105)(zm). The taxable event under
			<lb />
			the impugned law is the rendition of service. The
			<lb />
			impugned tax is not on material or sale. It is on
			<lb />
			activity/service rendered by the service provider to its
			<lb />
			customer. Equipment leasing/hire-purchase finance are
			<lb />
			long-term financing activities undertaken as their
			<lb />
			business by NBFCs. As far as the taxable value in case of
			<lb />
			financial leasing including equipment leasing and hire
			<lb />
			purchase is concerned, the amount received as principal
			<lb />
			is not the consideration for services rendered. Such
			<lb />
			amount is credited to the capital account of the
			<lb />
			lessor/hire-purchase
			<lb />
			service
			<lb />
			provider.
			<lb />
			It
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			interest/finance charge which is treated as income or
			<lb />
			revenue and which is credited to the revenue account.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Such interest or finance charges together with the lease
			<lb />
			management fee/processing fee/documentation charges
			<lb />
			are treated as considerations for the services rendered
			<lb />
			and accordingly they constitute the value of taxable
			<lb />
			services on which service tax is made payable.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			60. In fact, the Government has given exemption from
			<lb />
			payment of service tax to financial leasing services
			<lb />
			including equipment leasing and hire purchase on that
			<lb />
			portion of taxable value comprising of 90% of the amount
			<lb />
			representing as interest i.e. the difference between the
			<lb />
			instalment paid towards repayment of the lease amount
			<lb />
			and the principal amount in such instalments paid (see
			<lb />
			Notification No. 4/2006 -Service Tax dated 1-3-2006).
			<lb />
			In other words, service tax is leviable only on 10% of the
			<lb />
			interest portion. (See also Circular F. No. B.11/1/2001-
			<lb />
			TRU dated 9-7-2001 in which it has been clarified that
			<lb />
			service tax, in the case of financial leasing including
			<lb />
			equipment leasing and hire purchase, will be leviable only
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			lease
			<lb />
			management
			<lb />
			fees/processing
			<lb />
			fees/documentation charges recovered at the time of
			<lb />
			entering into the agreement and on the finance/interest
			<lb />
			charges recovered in equated monthly instalments and
			<lb />
			not on the principal amount.) Merely because for
			<lb />
			valuation purposes inter alia &quot;finance/interest charges&quot;
			<lb />
			are taken into account and merely because service tax is
			<lb />
			imposed on financial services with reference to
			<lb />
			&quot;hiring/interest&quot; charges, the impugned tax does not
			<lb />
			cease to be service tax and nor does it become tax on
			<lb />
			hire-purchase/leasing transactions under Article 366(29-
			<lb />
			A) read with Entry 54, List II. Thus, while the State
			<lb />
			Legislature is competent to impose tax on &quot;sale&quot; by
			<lb />
			legislation relatable to Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule, tax on the aspect of the &quot;services&quot;, vendor not
			<lb />
			being relatable to any entry in the State List, would be
			<lb />
			within the legislative competence of Parliament under
			<lb />
			Article 248 read with Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh
			<lb />
			Schedule to the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ac)
			<lb />
			It may be noticed that the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court
			<lb />
			split the transaction into two components i.e. &quot;sale&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;service&quot;. It is pertinent to note that the service tax was
			<lb />
			imposed only on the component of the service @ 10 % of
			<lb />
			the contract value.
			<lb />
			While considering the nature of
			<lb />
			transaction it has been found by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court
			<lb />
			that the part of the transaction like interest/ financing
			<lb />
			charges with lease management fee, processing fee and
			<lb />
			documentation charges are consideration for rendering
			<lb />
			service by the non-banking financial companies and thus fall
			<lb />
			within the definition of &quot;taxable service&quot; defined in Section
			<lb />
			65 (105)(zm).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ad)
			<lb />
			Another judgment heavily relied upon by Mr.
			<lb />
			Razzak is (2004) 5 SCC 632 : T.N. Kalyanamandapam
			<lb />
			Association vs. Union of India &amp; Others. In this case
			<lb />
			vires of Sections 65(19), (20), (41)(p), and 66, 67(o) of the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 1994 as amended from time to time were
			<lb />
			assailed being ultra vires.
			<lb />
			Under the above provisions
			<lb />
			service tax was levied on the services rendered by the
			<lb />
			mandap-keepers in respect to the temporary leasing of land
			<lb />
			for organizing official, social or business functions and even
			<lb />
			for catering services which inter alia includes furniture,
			<lb />
			fixtures, light fittings, floor covering etc. on 60% of the
			<lb />
			gross amount charged by the mandap-keepers. The vires of
			<lb />
			the provision was challenged on the ground that it is a tax
			<lb />
			on land and building under entries 18 and 49 of List II of the
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule. It also amounts to tax on sale under
			<lb />
			entry 54 of List II particularly in view of definition of &apos;sale&apos;
			<lb />
			and &apos;purchase&apos; under Article 366 (29A)(f).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ae)
			<lb />
			The High Court rejected the contention and in
			<lb />
			appeal the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court affirmed the judgment
			<lb />
			holding that the activity of mandap-keepers does not fall in
			<lb />
			any of the entries i.e. 18 and 49 of the State List. As
			<lb />
			regards the entry 54 is concerned it has been held that the
			<lb />
			tax have been levied on 60% of the gross receipts. It is
			<lb />
			further held that predominantly the activity of the mandap-
			<lb />
			keepers is rendering various kinds of services. Applying the
			<lb />
			aspect doctrine, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;58. A tax on services rendered by mandap-keepers
			<lb />
			and outdoor caterers is in pith and substance, a tax on
			<lb />
			services and not a tax on sale of goods or on hire-
			<lb />
			purchase activities. Section 65 clause (41) sub-clause (p)
			<lb />
			of the Finance Act, 1994, defines taxable service (which is
			<lb />
			the subject-matter of levy of service tax) as any service
			<lb />
			provided to a customer
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;by a mandap-keeper in relation to the use of a
			<lb />
			mandap in any manner including the facilities
			<lb />
			provided to [a customer] in relation to such use
			<lb />
			and also the services, if any, rendered as a
			<lb />
			caterer&quot;.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			The nature and character of this service tax is evident
			<lb />
			from the fact that the transaction between a mandap-
			<lb />
			keeper and his customer is definitely not in the nature of
			<lb />
			a sale or hire-purchase of goods. It is essentially that of
			<lb />
			providing a service. In fact, as pointed out earlier, the
			<lb />
			manner of service provided assumes predominance over
			<lb />
			the providing of food in such situations which is a definite
			<lb />
			indicator of the supremacy of the service aspect. The
			<lb />
			legislature in its wisdom noticed the said supremacy and
			<lb />
			identified the same as a potential region to collect indirect
			<lb />
			taxes. Moreover, it has been a well-established judicial
			<lb />
			principle that so long as the legislation is in substance, on
			<lb />
			a matter assigned to a legislature enacting that statute, it
			<lb />
			must be held valid in its entirety even though it may
			<lb />
			trench upon matters beyond its competence. Incidental
			<lb />
			encroachment does not invalidate such a statute on the
			<lb />
			grounds that it is beyond the competence of the
			<lb />
			legislature (Prafulla Kumar v. Bank of Commerce [ AIR
			<lb />
			1947 PC 60 :
			74 IA 23] ). Article 246(1) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution specifies that Parliament has exclusive
			<lb />
			powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters
			<lb />
			enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to the
			<lb />
			Constitution. As per Article 246(3), the State Government
			<lb />
			has exclusive powers to make laws with respect to
			<lb />
			matters enumerated in List II (State List). In respect of
			<lb />
			matters enumerated in List III (Concurrent List) both
			<lb />
			Parliament and State Governments have powers to make
			<lb />
			laws. The service tax is made by Parliament under the
			<lb />
			above residuary powers.

			<lb />
			Another judgment on which emphasis has been
			<lb />
			laid on behalf of respondents is (2007) 7 SCC 527 : All
			<lb />
			India Federation of Tax Practitioners &amp; Others vs.
			<lb />
			Union of India &amp; Others. In this case levy of service tax
			<lb />
			on practicing Chartered Accountants, Cost Accountants and
			<lb />
			Architects vide the Finance Act, 1994 was assailed. The
			<lb />
			challenge was based upon the legislative competence of
			<lb />
			State Legislature to levy tax on professions, etc. under entry
			<lb />
			60 of List II and Article 276 of the Constitution of India. It
			<lb />
			was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the service
			<lb />
			tax on professionals is a tax of profession and thus beyond
			<lb />
			the legislative competence of the Parliament. Repelling the
			<lb />
			argument and drawing distinction between the tax on
			<lb />
			profession and services rendered by the professionals, the
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;34. As stated above, Entry 60, List II refers to taxes on
			<lb />
			professions, etc. It is the tax on the individual person/firm
			<lb />
			or company. It is the tax on the status. A chartered
			<lb />
			accountant or a cost accountant obtains a licence or a
			<lb />
			privilege from the competent body to practise. On that
			<lb />
			privilege as such the State is competent to levy a tax
			<lb />
			under Entry 60. However, as stated above, Entry 60 is
			<lb />
			not a general entry. It cannot be read to include every
			<lb />
			activity undertaken by a chartered accountant/cost
			<lb />
			accountant/architect for consideration. Service tax is a
			<lb />
			tax on each activity undertaken by a chartered
			<lb />
			accountant/cost accountant or an architect. The cost
			<lb />
			accountant/chartered accountant/architect charges his
			<lb />
			client for advice or for auditing of accounts. Similarly, a
			<lb />
			cost accountant charges his client for advice as well as
			<lb />
			doing the work of costing. For each transaction or
			<lb />
			contract, the chartered accountant/cost accountant
			<lb />
			renders profession
			<lb />
			based
			<lb />
			services.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			activity
			<lb />
			undertaken by the chartered accountant or the cost
			<lb />
			accountant or an architect has two aspects. From the
			<lb />
			point of view of the chartered accountant/cost accountant
			<lb />
			it is an activity undertaken by him based on his
			<lb />
			performance and skill. But from the point of view of his
			<lb />
			client, the chartered accountant/cost accountant is his
			<lb />
			service provider. It is a tax on &quot;services&quot;. The activity
			<lb />
			undertaken by the chartered accountant or cost
			<lb />
			accountant is similar to saleable or marketable
			<lb />
			commodities produced by the assessee and cleared by
			<lb />
			the assessee for home consumption under the Central
			<lb />
			Excise Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			35. For each contract, tax is levied under the Finance
			<lb />
			Acts, 1994 and 1998. Tax cannot be levied under that Act
			<lb />
			without service being provided whereas a professional tax
			<lb />
			under Entry 60 is a tax on his status. It is the tax on the
			<lb />
			status of a cost accountant or a chartered accountant. As
			<lb />
			long as a person/firm remains in the profession, he/it has
			<lb />
			to pay professional tax. That tax has nothing to do with
			<lb />
			the commercial activities which he undertakes for his
			<lb />
			client. Even if the chartered accountant has no work
			<lb />
			throughout the accounting year, still he has to pay
			<lb />
			professional tax. He has to pay the tax till he remains in
			<lb />
			the profession. This is the ambit and scope of Entry 60,
			<lb />
			List II which is a taxing entry. Therefore, Entry 60
			<lb />
			contemplates tax on professions, as such. Entry 60, List
			<lb />
			II refers to &quot;tax on employments&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ag)
			<lb />
			From the ratio of above judgments, the
			<lb />
			emergence of proposition of law is that where the
			<lb />
			transaction or contract comprises of twin elements of sale
			<lb />
			and service, both, the State Legislature under entry 54 of
			<lb />
			List II and simultaneously the Parliament in exercise of
			<lb />
			residuary power under entry 97 of List I are competent to
			<lb />
			levy &quot;sales tax&quot; and &quot;service tax&quot; respectively provided the
			<lb />
			components of sale and service are visible and are capable
			<lb />
			of compartmentalization.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(v) whether such circumstances exist in the case in
			<lb />
			hand?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ah)
			<lb />
			The facts of the present case are clearly
			<lb />
			distinguishable as noticed in the earlier part of the
			<lb />
			discussion. We have opined that the State Government is
			<lb />
			not paying any consideration to the petitioners nor the
			<lb />
			petitioners are rendering any service to the State. To the
			<lb />
			contrary the petitioners are paying minimum guaranteed
			<lb />
			amount for the purchase of entire lot of lotteries at the
			<lb />
			discounted price of 70 paise against the MRP of Re.1/-to the
			<lb />
			State. The nature of discount has already been discussed in
			<lb />
			detail.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ai)
			<lb />
			It has been held by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (Supra) that
			<lb />
			the service is an activity and service tax is in the nature of
			<lb />
			VAT i.e. Value Added Tax. The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			State of Bombay vs R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala (supra)
			<lb />
			has also defined the betting and gambling as an activity.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(aj)
			<lb />
			In T.N. Kalyanamandapam Association&apos;s case
			<lb />
			(supra) the clear view of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court is that
			<lb />
			the predominant activity of the service provider was
			<lb />
			rendering of service and levy of service tax on 60% of the
			<lb />
			gross value was upheld and similarly in Assn. of Leasing &amp;
			<lb />
			Financial Service Companies case levy of service tax on
			<lb />
			10% of the gross contract value was upheld being a tax on
			<lb />
			component of service.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ak)
			<lb />
			In the present case, undisputedly the lottery ticket
			<lb />
			is sold as a good by the State Government to the petitioners
			<lb />
			at the discounted value of 70 paise per ticket as against its
			<lb />
			gross value/ MRP of Re.1/-. The predominant part of the
			<lb />
			transaction is sale of goods. While considering the discount
			<lb />
			of 30% to the petitioners on the MRP, we have held that the
			<lb />
			discount is a normal trade practice in any transaction of sale
			<lb />
			and purchase. If the seller sells the goods at the MRP to its
			<lb />
			ultimate consumer, no intermediary will sell the goods
			<lb />
			unless he gets a discount to meet the expenditure for
			<lb />
			establishment, logistics and some component of profit. The
			<lb />
			State Government is unable to sell the tickets to the
			<lb />
			ultimate buyers and for that purpose the petitioners are
			<lb />
			appointed as stockists or distributors on payment of full sale
			<lb />
			consideration on discounted price. Further the sale by the
			<lb />
			petitioners to their stockists, selling agents etc is on
			<lb />
			discounted price from MRP after keeping the establishment
			<lb />
			and other expenditure and margin of profit for themselves.
			<lb />
			The last sale to the consumer of the lottery is on the MRP of
			<lb />
			Re.1/-per ticket. Thus, all the intermediaries have to be
			<lb />
			given discount from MRP for the purpose of meeting their
			<lb />
			expenditure and some component of profit.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			advertisement etc. is only to popularize the State lottery but
			<lb />
			that does not mean that it is a service rendered to the State
			<lb />
			Government. As argued by Mr. Madhav Rao, this is for
			<lb />
			promotion of their own sale at their own expense without
			<lb />
			recovering it from the State Government. In any case
			<lb />
			service tax is being levied and collected on the gross amount
			<lb />
			without even isolating the discounted cost of lottery ticket.
			<lb />
			Thus in the present case there does not seem to be any
			<lb />
			circumstance where the activity of sale of State organized
			<lb />
			lottery by the petitioners through its various stockists,
			<lb />
			agents etc. can be construed to be the service rendered to
			<lb />
			the State Government so as to enable the Central
			<lb />
			Government to impose service tax on any component or
			<lb />
			element of the transaction between the State and the
			<lb />
			petitioners
			<lb />

		<head>
			Conclusions: -
			<lb />
		</head>

		<item>
			(i) In the backdrop of discussion on Ground (A) we
			<lb />
			have no hesitation to conclude that the activities
			<lb />
			of the lottery distributors i.e. the petitioners
			<lb />
			herein do not constitute a service and thus beyond
			<lb />
			the purview of &quot;taxable service&quot; as statutorily
			<lb />
			defined under clause (zzzzn) of sub-section 105 of
			<lb />
			Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended
			<lb />
			vide Finance Act, 2010.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The activity of promotion, marketing, organizing
			<lb />
			or in any other manner assisting in organising
			<lb />
			game of chance including lottery is an activity
			<lb />
			included in the expression &quot;betting and gambling&quot;
			<lb />
			as incorporated under Entry 34 and 62 of List II to
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) The activity of promotion, marketing, organizing
			<lb />
			or in any other manner assisting in organising
			<lb />
			game of chance including lottery being an activity
			<lb />
			of &quot;betting and gambling&quot; under Entry 62, List II
			<lb />
			to Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, the
			<lb />
			State Legislature alone is competent to levy any
			<lb />
			tax on such activity under Entry 62.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) The Parliament has the competence and
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to levy taxes on any subject matter
			<lb />
			including &quot;service tax&quot; under Entry 97, List I, read
			<lb />
			with Article 248 of the Constitution of India except
			<lb />
			where such powers are traceable to any of the
			<lb />
			entries in List II and III to Seventh Schedule of
			<lb />
			Constitution of India.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) Power to tax the activity of &quot;betting and gambling&quot;
			<lb />
			as explained above being within the exclusive
			<lb />
			domain of State Legislature under Entry 62, List
			<lb />
			II, the Parliament in exercise of its residuary
			<lb />
			power under Entry 97, List I to Seventh Schedule
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Constitution
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			India
			<lb />
			lacks
			<lb />
			legislative
			<lb />
			competence to impose any tax including &quot;service
			<lb />
			tax&quot; on such activity.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			19.
			<lb />
			In view of the above conclusions, we allow these
			<lb />
			petitions, strike down the clause (zzzzn) to sub-section 105
			<lb />
			of Section 65 of Finance Act, 1994 as introduced vide
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2010 as ultra vires to Constitution of India
			<lb />
			having been enacted in contravention to Entry 97, List I to
			<lb />
			Seventh Schedule read with Article 248 of Constitution of
			<lb />
			India.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.
			<lb />
			We also set aside all the consequential actions of
			<lb />
			respondents imposing service tax upon the petitioners being
			<lb />
			distributors of lottery organized by State of Sikkim.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.
			<lb />
			Since the petitioners secured registration and paid
			<lb />
			service tax under the impugned provision on their own, this
			<lb />
			judgment shall operate prospectively.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			22.
			<lb />
			In the facts and circumstances no order as to
			<lb />
			costs.
