            <lb />

            In the case of Kanaram Dhayal in DB Civil Writ
            <lb />
            Petition No.2795/2016, additional challenge is made to
            <lb />
            Justice Jas Raj Chopra Committee report dated 15 th
            <lb />
            December, 2007.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            By the Act of 2015, five castes, earlier falling
            <lb />
            in the category of Other Backward Classes and getting
            <lb />
            benefit of reservation, have been brought in the category
            <lb />
            of Special Backward Classes to provide 5 per cent
            <lb />
            reservation exceeding the ceiling of 50 per cent.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted
            <lb />
            that efforts of the Government is to somehow provide 5 per
            <lb />
            cent reservation to Gurjars/Gujjars and other castes. It was
            <lb />
            after Gurjar/Gujjar agitation for their inclusion in the
            <lb />
            category of Scheduled Tribes. The Government initially
            <lb />
            constituted Justice Jas Raj Chopra Committee but when
            <lb />
            Gurjars/Gujjars could not be included in the category of
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes then they were provided special reservation
            <lb />
            without quantifiable data. It was under a fear of agitation
            <lb />
            again.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            It is stated that prior to filing of the present
            <lb />
            writ petition, the petitioner had preferred Public Interest
            <lb />
            Litigation (DB Civil Writ Petition No.13491/2009). It was to
            <lb />
            challenge the Rajasthan Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
            <lb />
            Tribes, Backward Classes, Special Backward Classes and
            <lb />
            Economically Backward Classes (Reservation of Seats in
            <lb />
            Educational Institutions in the State and of Appointments
            <lb />
            and Posts in Services under the State) Act, 2008 (for
            <lb />
            short &quot;the Act of 2008&quot;). The said writ petition was decided
            <lb />
            vide order dated 22 nd February, 2012. The State Government
            <lb />
            was directed to revisit Sections 3 &amp; 4 of the Act of 2008 as
            <lb />
            well as the Notification. The Division Bench found that
            <lb />
            quantifiable data have not been collected to provide
            <lb />
            reservation beyond 50 per cent. The Court observed that
            <lb />
            when five castes were falling in the category of other
            <lb />
            backward classes then why category of Special Backward
            <lb />
            Classes has been created to provide 5 per cent reservation
            <lb />
            exceeding 50 per cent. Several other observations were made
            <lb />
            in the aforesaid judgment.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            A reference of the judgment of the Apex Court in
            <lb />
            the case of M. Nagaraj &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India &amp;
            <lb />
            Ors. reported in (2006) 8 SCC 212 and Ashoka Kumar
            <lb />
            Thakur Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. reported in (2008) 6
            <lb />
            SCC 1 was given by the Division Bench. The direction was to
            <lb />
            keep in mind the law laid down by the Apex Court in various
            <lb />
            cases, which includes the judgments, referred to above and
            <lb />
            also in the case of Indra Sawhney etc. etc. Vs. Union of
            <lb />
            India &amp; Ors. reported in (1992) Suppl. 3 SCC 217. The
            <lb />
            matter was ordered to be led before the Commission. The
            <lb />
            petitioners were to be given opportunity amongst others to
            <lb />
            present their case. It was, however, directed that the State
            <lb />
            would not give effect to the Act of 2008 till then. After the
            <lb />
            judgment aforesaid, the matter was led before the OBC
            <lb />
            Commission where the petitioners were also given opportunity
            <lb />
            of hearing. Several objections were raised before the
            <lb />
            Commission. The Commission has given its report. It is based
            <lb />
            on the report of an agency and the State. It was even after
            <lb />
            considering the instructions given by the State Government
            <lb />
            to examine the requirement of special backward class status
            <lb />
            to certain castes, namely, (i) Banjara/Baladiya/Labana, (ii)
            <lb />
            Gadia Luhar/Gadolia, (iii) Gujar/Gurjar and (iv) Raika/Raibari
            <lb />
            (Devash). A Notification was then issued on 13 th December,
            <lb />
            2012.
            <lb />
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            The petitioners preferred DB Civil Writ Petition
            <lb />
            No.1862/2013 to challenge the subsequent Notification dated
            <lb />
            13 th December, 2012 as well as the report of the SBC
            <lb />
            Commission of the year 2012. It was apart from challenge to
            <lb />
            the order dated 13 th December, 2012 and report given by the
            <lb />
            Institute of Development Studies (for short &quot;IDS&quot;) 2012.
            <lb />
            A prayer was also made for exclusion of &quot;Meena&quot; community
            <lb />
            from the category of Schedule Tribes in view of their
            <lb />
            adequate representation in services. A Public Interest
            <lb />
            Litigation, by a writ petition, bearing No.5202/2012 was also
            <lb />
            filed by one Mukesh Solanki. The Division Bench passed a
            <lb />
            detailed order on 29 th January, 2013 staying the operation of
            <lb />
            the Notification dated 13 th December, 2012 in the said writ
            <lb />
            petition.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            During pendency of those writ petitions, a
            <lb />
            Notification dated 16 th October, 2015 was brought and is
            <lb />
            under challenge. The petitioners after knowing about issuance
            <lb />
            of the Notification dated 16 th October, 2015 and its
            <lb />
            retrospective effect, moved an application in pending writ
            <lb />
            petition bearing No.1862/2013 to invite attention of the
            <lb />
            Court towards willful disobedience of its order thus to
            <lb />
            initiate contempt proceedings by invoking Article 215 of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India. An application was submitted by the
            <lb />
            State Government as well to declare the writ petition to be
            <lb />
            infructuous. The Division Bench of this Court rendered the
            <lb />
            writ petition to be infructuous vide its order dated 04 th
            <lb />
            February, 2016 with liberty to raise all the issues in the
            <lb />
            present writ petition/s. The petitioners filed these writ
            <lb />
            petitions to challenge validity of the Notification dated 16 th
            <lb />
            October, 2015 apart from the Act of 2015.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            Learned counsel for the petitioners have given
            <lb />
            brief history of the earlier litigation to show present writ
            <lb />
            petitions to be in continuance to the earlier.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            It is submitted that recommendation of the
            <lb />
            Commission as well as the Act of 2015 are violative of
            <lb />
            Articles 15 &amp; 16 of the Constitution of India. Article 15 of
            <lb />
            the Constitution of India prohibits discrimination on the
            <lb />
            ground of religion/race/caste/sex or place of birth etc.
            <lb />
            Article 15(4), however, provides that nothing in this article or
            <lb />
            in clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from
            <lb />
            making special provision for advancement of any socially and
            <lb />
            educationally backward classes of citizens or for the
            <lb />
            Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            In the similar manner, Article 16(2) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India prohibits discrimination on the grounds
            <lb />
            of religion/race/caste/sex or place of birth etc. Article 16(4)
            <lb />
            of the Constitution of India, however, provides for
            <lb />
            reservation to the backward class of citizens which, in the
            <lb />
            opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the
            <lb />
            services. Article 16(4A) of the Constitution of India was
            <lb />
            added by 77 th Constitutional Amendment and Article 16(4B)
            <lb />
            was inserted by 81 st amendment. The amended provision of
            <lb />
            Article 16(4B) of the Constitution of India enables the State
            <lb />
            Government to consider unfilled vacancy of a year to be
            <lb />
            separate class and to be filled in any succeeding year or
            <lb />
            years. Such vacancies are not to be considered together with
            <lb />
            the vacancy of the year, in which, they are to be filled, for
            <lb />
            determining ceiling of 50 per cent reservation on the total
            <lb />
            number of vacancies, in that year.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            According to learned counsel for the petitioners,
            <lb />
            Article 16(4B) of the Constitution imposes ceiling of 50 per
            <lb />
            cent on the reservation to the vacancies of a year. If the Act
            <lb />
            of 2015 is given effect on recruitment, the constitutional
            <lb />
            mandate of Article 16(4B) cannot be adhered to. It provides
            <lb />
            reservation beyond 50 per cent even if it is applied on the
            <lb />
            vacancies of a year. It is thus hit by Article 16 (4B) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            It is further submitted that apart from violation
            <lb />
            of the constitutional provisions, the Act of 2015 even goes
            <lb />
            against the judgment of the Constitutional Bench of the
            <lb />
            Supreme Court in the case of M.R. Balaji &amp; Ors. Vs. State
            <lb />
            of Mysore reported in 1963 AIR 649. In the said case,
            <lb />
            Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution were considered.
            <lb />
            The Court found that interest of weaker sections of the
            <lb />
            society is to be adjudged with the interests of other
            <lb />
            communities. The judgment on competing claims is
            <lb />
            undoubtedly a difficult matter, but, under the guise of making
            <lb />
            special provision, if the State reserves practically all the
            <lb />
            seats available in the colleges then it would be subverting the
            <lb />
            object of Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India. In that
            <lb />
            case, the Court was reluctant to say definitely what would be
            <lb />
            a proper provision to make but speaking generally and in a
            <lb />
            broader way, a special provision for reservation should be less
            <lb />
            than 50 percent of the seats and how much less than 50
            <lb />
            percent, depends on the circumstances of each case. In the
            <lb />
            said case, recommendation of the Nagana Gowda Committee
            <lb />
            for 68 per cent reservation was not found proper in the
            <lb />
            larger interest of the State. The direction was accordingly
            <lb />
            given to the State Government that while making
            <lb />
            advancement of the weaker sections of the society, they
            <lb />
            should approach the task objectively in a rational manner. The
            <lb />
            recommendation of the committee for reservation to the
            <lb />
            extent of 68 percent was held to be inconsistent with Article
            <lb />
            15(4) of the Constitution of India.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            The powers of the Court were also considered by
            <lb />
            the Apex Court. It was found that the Courts often consider
            <lb />
            substance of the matter and not its form. The veil of the
            <lb />
            executive action can be lifted for careful scrutiny. If the
            <lb />
            executive action, in substance and in truth, has transgressed
            <lb />
            the constitutional powers, the impugned action should be
            <lb />
            struck down treating it to be a fraud on the constitution. The
            <lb />
            determination of the backward class solely based on the
            <lb />
            caste was held to be in violative of Article 15(4) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India.
            <lb />
        </p>
        <p>
            In view of the judgment in the case of M.R.Balaji
            <lb />
            &amp; Ors. (supra), the State Government should not have
            <lb />
            provided reservation in the educational institutions beyond 50
            <lb />
            per cent of the total seats meant for admission. It is moreso
            <lb />
            when the judgment in the case of M.R.Balaji &amp; Ors. (supra)
            <lb />
            was affirmed subsequently by the Constitutional Bench of the
            <lb />
            Apex Court in the case of Indra Sahwney (supra) and also in
            <lb />
            the case of Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra).
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            The Supreme Court further reiterated the same
            <lb />
            proposition of law in the case of M.Nagaraj (supra) and
            <lb />
            Kumari K.S. Jayashree &amp; Anr. Vs. State of Kerala &amp; Anr.
            <lb />
            reported in 1976 AIR 2381. The Commission as well as the
            <lb />
            State Government failed to appreciate the judgments
            <lb />
            aforesaid, despite specific directions of the Division Bench,
            <lb />
            while deciding the Public Interest Litigation vide its judgment
            <lb />
            dated 22 nd February, 2012 in DB Civil Writ Petition
            <lb />
            No.13491/2009.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            Learned counsel further submitted that even as
            <lb />
            per Article 16(4B) of the Constitution of India, the
            <lb />
            reservation cannot be provided beyond 50 percent of the
            <lb />
            vacancies of a year, though while adhering ceiling of 50
            <lb />
            percent, unfilled vacancies of previous year are to be taken
            <lb />
            separately. The unfilled vacancies are considered to be those
            <lb />
            which could not be filled in the earlier years in accordance
            <lb />
            with the provisions for reservation. It may be due to non-
            <lb />
            availability of the reserve caste candidates to the extent of
            <lb />
            the vacancies reserved for them. The State Government
            <lb />
            cannot reserve vacancies of a year beyond 50 per cent. If the
            <lb />
            Act of 2015 is given effect, reservation would be beyond the
            <lb />
            ceiling of 50 per cent against the vacancies of a year.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            Learned counsel for the petitioners have given
            <lb />
            reference of several judgments of the Supreme Court and
            <lb />
            this Court to substantiate their arguments, which would be
            <lb />
            considered and discussed in the later part of the judgment.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            The petitioner Shrawan Singh Tanwer, appearing
            <lb />
            in person, has further assailed the report of the SBC
            <lb />
            Commission. Reference of various parts of the report has
            <lb />
            been given to show recommendation in violation and in
            <lb />
            ignorance of several judgments of the Supreme Court apart
            <lb />
            from the Constitution of India. The Commission was under an
            <lb />
            obligation to see various factors including adequacy of
            <lb />
            representation of various castes in services. If a caste is
            <lb />
            adequately represented in services, then to be excluded from
            <lb />
            reservation. It applies for admission in the educational
            <lb />
            institutions also.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            The statements referred in the report shows
            <lb />
            that many castes have been adequately represented in
            <lb />
            services, rather, major benefit of OBC reservation is taken
            <lb />
            by them, yet not excluded so as to pass on the benefit of the
            <lb />
            reservation to other castes. The table given in the report
            <lb />
            reveals percentage of representation of various castes in
            <lb />
            services. The Commission has considered the case of five
            <lb />
            castes only leaving others. It ignored the mandate and
            <lb />
            direction given earlier by the Division Bench in the Public
            <lb />
            Interest Litigation, decided vide order dated 22 nd February,
            <lb />
            2012.
            <lb />
            The Commission failed to get quantifiable data to
            <lb />
            recommend special reservation to backward classes by
            <lb />
            forming a special group for them. It is not that reservation to
            <lb />
            the five castes, included in the category of special backward
            <lb />
            classes, was not provided earlier. All the five castes were
            <lb />
            getting reservation meant for OBC, yet taken in the category
            <lb />
            of special backward classes. The Commission was required to
            <lb />
            address as to what are the extra ordinary reasons to provide
            <lb />
            a separate and special category of reservation and to cross
            <lb />
            the ceiling of 50 percent for them. The issues aforesaid have
            <lb />
            not been addressed by the Commission.
            <lb />
            The petitioner, present in person, and learned
            <lb />
            counsel appearing for the petitioners have made reference of
            <lb />
            various parts of the report of the Commission to show
            <lb />
            discrepancies therein apart from non-adherence of mandate
            <lb />
            of the judgment of Apex Court and the Constitution. It would
            <lb />
            be discussed by this Court appropriately after considering
            <lb />
            the arguments of learned counsel for the respondents.
            <lb />
            A reference of the object in bringing 81 st
            <lb />
            amendment in the Constitution has also been given. It is to
            <lb />
            reiterate ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation. It permits
            <lb />
            reservation beyond 50 per cent against backlog vacancies
            <lb />
            only. The backlog vacancies are to be taken separately so that
            <lb />
            it is not affected by ceiling of 50 per cent. The Act under
            <lb />
            challenge has been enacted in ignorance of the object in
            <lb />
            bringing 81 st amendment in the Constitution of India.
            <lb />
            The report of SBC Commission reveals its
            <lb />
            exercise only to the extent of recommendation in favour of
            <lb />
            five castes, whereas, 82 castes were identified for
            <lb />
            consideration. The Commission seems to have constituted to
            <lb />
            make recommendations only for five castes leaving the
            <lb />
            others. The way, recommendations have been made by the
            <lb />
            SBC Commission reveals nothing but to act as per the wishes
            <lb />
            of the State Government to provide reservation to few
            <lb />
            castes.
            <lb />
            A reference of the directions of Division Bench of
            <lb />
            this Court has been given in the report. The Commission was
            <lb />
            required to get a survey of all the 82 castes by a scientific
            <lb />
            method. The Commission has admitted that as per the
            <lb />
            settlement and otherwise, survey was to be conducted
            <lb />
            through a scientific method and while doing so, it was
            <lb />
            required to consider the directions of the High Court on
            <lb />
            various issues. The IDS was given task to conduct survey. The
            <lb />
            Commission found that the IDS has failed to conduct survey
            <lb />
            by scientific method on proportionate basis.
            <lb />
            The IDS further failed to make assessment of
            <lb />
            the backwardness of the caste by taking total population
            <lb />
            percentage to draw their proportionate representation, thus
            <lb />
            report was not found to be reliable. The Commission
            <lb />
            considered census of 1931 for ascertaining the proportionate
            <lb />
            population percentage of each caste in the State of
            <lb />
            Rajasthan, whereas, census of 1931 could not have been taken
            <lb />
            into consideration to draw quantifiable data. The recent data
            <lb />
            of each caste should have been taken into consideration with
            <lb />
            their backwardness in terms of the education and
            <lb />
            representation in services. The table given under chapter nine
            <lb />
            of the report for different castes has not been drawn on
            <lb />
            scientific basis. The recommendations are contrary to the
            <lb />
            details given in the said Chapter itself, thus report of SBC
            <lb />
            Commission has contradictory conclusions. The SBC
            <lb />
            Commission has failed to discharge its duties, as was
            <lb />
            expected and directed by the Apex Court and this High
            <lb />
            Court. Thus, report of SBC Commission should be rejected.
            <lb />
            The survey report of the IDS was discarded by
            <lb />
            the Commission, yet references of various factors taken into
            <lb />
            consideration by the IDS has been given in Chapter nine of
            <lb />
            the report. In the same manner, no report exists for 25
            <lb />
            castes. The Commission should have made survey for all the
            <lb />
            82 castes, but, it failed to do so.
            <lb />
            Learned counsel and the petitioner, present in
            <lb />
            person, have given reference of other parts of the report
            <lb />
            also to show not only discrepancies but an effort to make
            <lb />
            report to fulfill the wishes of the State Government.
            <lb />
            A reference of the 9 th report of the State
            <lb />
            Backward Class Commission has also been given apart from
            <lb />
            the reference of the report of Justice Jasraj Chopra
            <lb />
            Committee. It is to show variation in recommendations.
            <lb />
            Learned counsel as well as the petitioner in person
            <lb />
            have made elaborate arguments in reference to various
            <lb />
            judgments of the Apex Court and the recommendations of
            <lb />
            the SBC Commission, which would be considered while
            <lb />
            referring to the rival arguments of the parties.
            <lb />
            The locus of the petitioners in maintaining writ
            <lb />
            petitions has also been explained.
            <lb />
            The petitioners Captain Gurvinder Singh and
            <lb />
            others were litigant earlier also when not only Public Interest
            <lb />
            Litigation but other petitions were decided by the Division
            <lb />
            Bench of this Court. The Court, in its earlier judgment dated
            <lb />
            22 nd December, 2010 left all the issues open for its decision
            <lb />
            and gave liberty to the petitioners to raise it again, if so
            <lb />
            required. The petitioners were given liberty to represent and
            <lb />
            raise all the issues before the SBC Commission also. Their
            <lb />
            representations were allowed even by the SBC Commission,
            <lb />
            thus issue of locus has unnecessarily been raised by the
            <lb />
            private respondents. It is moreso when the petitioner Nos.2 &amp;
            <lb />
            3 in the case of Captain Gurvinder Singh &amp; Ors. are
            <lb />
            government employees and would be affected by the Act of
            <lb />
            2015, thus have locus to challenge it.
            <lb />
            The summary of the issues raised for challenge to
            <lb />
            the report of SBC Commission are as follows :-

            As per the report of Mandal Commission, there exists
            <lb />
            11 indicators of backwardness covering 22 points. The
            <lb />
            SBC Commission has excluded economic criteria
            <lb />
            altogether and, even for the special backwardness, only
            <lb />
            8 points have been considered. For educational

            backwardness, only two points have been referred,

            various castes in few services only. It was only for 24
            <lb />
            services out of 117. The State Government thus failed
            <lb />
            to provide proper data of representation of various
            <lb />
            castes in the services.

            The SBC Commission failed to consider that reservation
            <lb />
            to the OBC was provided in the year 1993 and few
            <lb />
            castes were added in the year 2000-2001, such as
            <lb />
            &quot;Jats&quot; etc. Their representation in services prior to
            <lb />

            per the Constitution and dictum of the Apex Court, the

            report should incorporate as to whether reservation

            would affect efficiency of administration. If the

            cannot be recommended.

            The SBC Commission has considered the case of around

            58 different courses of few colleges with few students,
            <lb />
            whereas, there are more than 4 lac students. The

            included in the list of special backward classes and no reason

            Learned Solicitor General Mr.Ranjeet Kumar has

            made a reference of settlement arrived between

            Gurjars/Gujjars and the Government of Rajasthan on 07 th
            <lb />
            June, 2007. As per the settlement, a High Powered
            <lb />
            Committee was constituted. Justice Jasraj Chopra (Retd.)
            <lb />
            was nominated as Chairman of the Committee. The State
            <lb />
            Government laid down the terms of the High Powered
            <lb />
            Committee. It was for inclusion of certain castes in the
            <lb />
            category of Schedule Tribes as per the criteria laid down by
            <lb />
            the Government of India.
            <lb />
            The Commission was to systematically examine the
            <lb />
            demand of the Gurjars/Gujjars by carefully studying
            <lb />
            different representations. The extensive survey was carried

            Justice Jasraj Chopra Committee submitted its
            <lb />
            report on 15 th December, 2007. The State Legislature
            <lb />
            brought an Act in the year 2008 to provide reservation to
            <lb />
            special backward classes and economically backward classes.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            68 per cent reservation in all was provided and, out of it, 5
            <lb />
            per cent was for Special Backward Classes and 14 per cent
            <lb />
            was to Economically Backward Classes. The State Government
            <lb />
            included four castes under Sections 3 &amp; 4 of the Act of
            <lb />
            2008.
            <lb />
            Three writ petitions were filed in the year 2009.
            <lb />
            The Division Bench of this Court, vide its order dated 12 th
            <lb />
            October, 2009, passed an interim order against the
            <lb />
            reservation in excess to 50 per cent. The State Government
            <lb />
            issued an order on 06 th May, 2010 to provide one percent
            <lb />
            reservation to the Special Backward Classes after taking into
            <lb />
            consideration the interim order passed by this Court.
            <lb />
            The writ petitions were thereupon decided vide
            <lb />
            order dated 22 nd December, 2010. It was found that High

            to enhance it more than stipulated prior

            beyond the percentage, which was

            existing prior to the Act of 2008, the

            State shall not give effect to the said

            quantifiable and comparative data of 82 different castes in
            <lb />

            Pursuant to the agreement, the IDS submitted its
            <lb />
            report on 31 st May 2011. The Government of Rajasthan
            <lb />
            thereupon constituted Rajasthan SBC Commission to make a
            <lb />
            report in consonance with the judgment of High Court dated
            <lb />
            22 nd December, 2010. The SBC Commission submitted its
            <lb />
            report in the month of November, 2012. Five castes were
            <lb />
            identified for providing 5 per cent reservation by taking them
            <lb />
            in Special Backward Class category.
            <lb />
            The State Government, thereupon, issued an order on
            <lb />
            30 th November, 2012 to provide five percent reservation to
            <lb />
            Special Backward Class in the educational institutions as well
            <lb />
            as in services under the State of Rajasthan. A challenge to
            <lb />
            the said order and the report submitted by IDS was made.
            <lb />
            The other writ petition was to challenge certain provisions of
            <lb />
            the Act of 2008. This Court passed an interim order on 29 th
            <lb />
            January, 2013, whereby, operation of the order as well as the
            <lb />
            Notification was stayed till disposal of the petition.
            <lb />
            The State Government filed an application for
            <lb />
            clarification as well as for modification of the interim order.
            <lb />
            The High Court was pleased to clarify its order for 01 per
            <lb />
            cent reservation in favour of the special backward class.

        <p>
            The State Government, thereupon, issued Notification
            <lb />
            to bring the Act of 2015 and is under challenge. The Act of
            <lb />
            2015 provides 5 per cent reservation to five castes in the
            <lb />
            category of special backward class. The Act was given effect
            <lb />
            from 16 th October, 2015.
            <lb />
            The challenge to the Notification as well as the Act of
            <lb />
            2015 apart from the report of the SBC Commission etc. has
            <lb />
            been made.
            <lb />
            The challenge to the Act of 2015 has been made on
            <lb />
            misconception of ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation. The
            <lb />
            reservation is permissible beyond 50 per cent under the
            <lb />
            Constitution and judgments of the Supreme Court. Learned
            <lb />
            counsel for petitioners have failed to take proper
            <lb />
            interpretation of the constitutional provisions as well as the
            <lb />
            judgments of the Apex Court while advancing the arguments
            <lb />
            for challenge to the Notification of 2015. Articles 15(4) and
            <lb />
            16(4) of the Constitution of India do not prescribe any
            <lb />
            numerical limit on reservation. In the case of Indra Sawhney
            <lb />
            (supra), the Apex Court held that reservation should not
            <lb />
            ordinarily exceed 50 per cent. The judgment of the Apex
            <lb />
            Court in the case of M.R.Balaji &amp; Ors. (supra) was clarified
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            29
            <lb />
            from binding rule of ceiling of 50 per cent to mere rule of
            <lb />
            prudence. The Apex Court, however, carved out exceptional
            <lb />
            circumstances to permit reservation beyond 50 per cent. It is
            <lb />
            in an extra ordinary situation. The ceiling of 50 per cent on
            <lb />
            reservation is an ordinary rule, excess to it is an exception,
            <lb />
            hence, ceiling of 50 per cent has not been put either by the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India or by the Apex Court.
            <lb />
            A reference of Article 16(4) of the Constitution of
            <lb />
            India has also been given. It does not preclude the State
            <lb />
            Government to provide reservation beyond 50 percent.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            81 st Constitutional Amendment in the year 2000 has not
            <lb />
            made any change in the law laid down by the Apex Court in the
            <lb />
            case of Indra Sawhney (supra). It was to clarify that for
            <lb />
            &quot;carry-forward vacancies&quot;, reservation can exceed to 50 per
            <lb />
            cent. The Parliament thus introduced Article 16(4B) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India for carry forward reserve vacancies and
            <lb />
            not to put ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation.
            <lb />
            The challenge to the Article 16(4A) and 16(4B) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India was decided by the Apex Court in the
            <lb />
            case of M.Nagaraj &amp; Ors. (supra). The petitioners have relied
            <lb />
            on certain paras of the judgment in the case of M.Nagaraj &amp;
            <lb />
            30
            <lb />
            Ors. (supra) to urge ceiling of 50 per cent as a strict rule.
            <lb />
            The Apex Court in the said case followed the judgment of
            <lb />
            Indra Sawhney (supra) on ceiling limit of 50 per cent. It is to
            <lb />
            be applied ordinarily but can exceed under extra ordinary
            <lb />
            situation, thus it is incorrect to submit ceiling of 50 per cent

            A further reference of the judgment in the case of
            <lb />
            S.V. Joshi &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka reported in
            <lb />
            (2012) 7 SCC 41 has been given. There, depending on the
            <lb />
            quantifiable data, reservation beyond 50 per cent has been
            <lb />
            made permissible.
            <lb />
            The petitioners have not considered Article 16 (4B) of
            <lb />
            the Constitution of India with the object, it was inserted.
            <lb />
            Article 16(4B) of the Constitution of India refers about
            <lb />
            ceiling of 50 per cent reservation for backlog vacancies. It
            <lb />
            has to be read in reference to the judgment of the Apex
            <lb />
            Court in the case of Indra Sawhney (supra). The ceiling of 50
            <lb />
            per cent on reservation is a general rule but exception has
            <lb />
            been allowed in para 810 of the said judgment. In view of the
            <lb />
            above, Article 16 (4B) of the Constitution of India does not
            <lb />
            propound theory of ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation. A

            <lb />
            also been given where challenge to the Act of 2008 was not
            <lb />
            accepted on the aforesaid ground. If the directions given
            <lb />
            therein are considered properly, it permits reservation
            <lb />
            beyond 50 percent but should be based on quantifiable data.
            <lb />
            The respondent State Government had revisited
            <lb />
            Sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 2008. The SBC Commission
            <lb />
            could collect quantifiable data before recommending
            <lb />
            reservation for special backward classes thus the challenge
            <lb />
            to the Notification and the Act of 2015 on the ground of
            <lb />
            ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation is not tenable.

            General Mr.Rajendra Prasad, appearing for the State of
            <lb />
            Rajasthan, further submitted that after the judgment of the
            <lb />
            Division Bench in the first bunch of writ petitions, the State
            <lb />
            Government entered into an agreement with the IDS for
            <lb />
            collection of quantifiable datas of 82 different castes
            <lb />
            included the category of other backward classes. The IDS is
            <lb />
            a reputed autonomous organisation in the field of social
            <lb />
            surveys. The report of the IDS has been indirectly endorsed

            <lb />
            by the Apex Court in the case of Ram Singh &amp; Ors. Vs.
            <lb />
            Union of India reported in (2015) 4 SCC 697. The IDS
            <lb />
            submitted its report in the month of June, 2012 based on
            <lb />
            quantifiable data. The said report was placed before the SBC
            <lb />
            Commission. The Commission thereafter gave its report. The
            <lb />
            legislative wisdom was invoked to provide 5 per cent
            <lb />
            reservation to special backward classes vide impugned
            <lb />
            Notification and the Act of 2015.
            <lb />
            A challenge to the report of the SBC Commission has
            <lb />
            been made in ignorance of the quantifiable data. It was in
            <lb />
            respect of all the issues, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of
            <lb />
            representation as well as effect on the efficiency of
            <lb />
            administration. The Commission as well as the State
            <lb />
            Government could make out an exceptional case to exceed to
            <lb />
            the ceiling of 50 per cent. The extra ordinary circumstances
            <lb />
            have been given to provide 5 percent special reservation to
            <lb />
            five castes.
            <lb />
            Para 810 of the judgment in the case of Indra Sawhney
            <lb />
            (supra) was referred specifically to reinforce the arguments
            <lb />
            on the ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation.
            <lb />
            The castes included in the category of special backward

            <lb />
            classes are &quot;Nomadic&quot;, resulting in severe backwardness. The
            <lb />
            historical background of those castes was also taken into
            <lb />
            consideration by the SBC Commission. A case of special
            <lb />
            reservation in their favour has thus made out.
            <lb />
            The data provided by the IDS were taken into
            <lb />
            consideration by the SBC Commission meticulously. It did not
            <lb />
            accept the data blindly, rather serious criticism to the
            <lb />
            methodology adopted by the IDS has been made. It shows
            <lb />
            independence of the Commission apart from the application of
            <lb />
            mind to draw proper conclusions for recommendations of
            <lb />
            special reservation in favour of five castes.
            <lb />
            The Commission had considered various historical
            <lb />
            documents, research papers, representation of different
            <lb />
            castes in services and data pertaining to admission in the
            <lb />
            educational institutions. In doing so, if some discrepancy had
            <lb />
            occurred, it deserves to be condoned as held by the Apex
            <lb />
            Court in the case of Ram Singh &amp; Ors. (supra). A small
            <lb />
            discrepancy should not be accepted to doubt the correctness
            <lb />
            of the report. The petitioners have given reference of various
            <lb />
            castes, which are having no representation or lessor
            <lb />
            representation in the services as well as in the educational

            courses as compared to the Gurjars/Gujjars and other four
            <lb />
            castes, which have been given special reservation. It is to
            <lb />
            show that despite no representation or lessor representation
            <lb />
            of other castes, recommendations in their favour have not
            <lb />
            been made. The aforesaid argument is based by misplaced
            <lb />
            understanding of law. As per the judgment of the Apex Court,
            <lb />
            issue relating to the backwardness, inadequacy of
            <lb />
            representation in service and educational institutions apart
            <lb />
            from effect on the efficiency in the administration is to be
            <lb />
            seen. In view of the above, the recommendations of the
            <lb />
            Commission may not be set aside.
            <lb />
            Learned Senior Advocate Mr.Ashok Gaur, appearing for
            <lb />
            the respondent No.4, raised objection about locus standi of
            <lb />
            the petitioner Captain Gurvinder Singh. It is submitted that
            <lb />
            no fundamental or legal rights of the petitioner have been
            <lb />
            infringed. To maintain the writ petition, the petitioner should
            <lb />
            fall in the definition of &quot;person aggrieved&quot;. The petitioner is
            <lb />
            not one who can be said to be &quot;person aggrieved&quot;. A reference
            <lb />

            <lb />
            It is further stated that report of the SBC Commission
            <lb />
            of the November, 2012 has not been challenged. In absence
            <lb />
            of challenge to the report of the SBC Commission,
            <lb />
            consequential Notification and enactment cannot be
            <lb />
            challenged. It is settled proposition of law that without
            <lb />
            challenging the basic order, consequential order or
            <lb />
            Notification cannot be challenged. The infirmity in the report
            <lb />
            can be shown only when it is challenged and not otherwise,
            <lb />
            thus the arguments for challenge to the report should not be
            <lb />
            accepted in absence of its challenge. To support the

            The interpretation of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India has not been taken correctly for
            <lb />
            assailing the Act of 2015. Both the provisions give power to
            <lb />
            provide reservation and ceiling of 50 per cent is not provided
            <lb />
            therein for appointment in services and admission in the
            <lb />
            educational institutions. After 81 st amendment in the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India, a challenge to it was made. The Apex
            <lb />
            Court upheld the constitutional amendment. It has permitted
            <lb />
            reservation beyond 50 per cent thus the argument of learned
            <lb />
            counsel for the petitioners about ceiling of 50 per cent on
            <lb />
            reservation in services is not tenable. The SBC Commission
            <lb />
            found extraordinary reasons to provide reservation beyond
            <lb />
            50 percent. It is based on quantifiable data collected through
            <lb />
            an agency deployed by the State of Rajasthan and also after
            <lb />

            Corporation Vs. Rajesh Kumar reported in 2012 (7) SCC 1,
            <lb />
            ceiling of 50 per cent has not been imposed on the
            <lb />
            reservation. The alleged limit of 50 per cent is not otherwise
            <lb />
            provided under Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India.
            <lb />
            The report submitted by the SBC Commission shows
            <lb />
            extraordinary reasons in favour of five castes. The
            <lb />
            quantifiable data collected shows social and educational
            <lb />
            backwardness of all the five castes. It is apart from the
            <lb />
            inadequacy of representation in government services so as in
            <lb />
            the educational courses. The reservation is not going to cause
            <lb />
            adverse effect on efficiency of administration, thus triple
            <lb />
            tests to justify special reservation in favour of five castes
            <lb />
            have been satisfied by the Commission. The Commission has
            <lb />
            38
            <lb />
            considered all the relevant issues and even the judgments of
            <lb />
            Apex Court, thus it has made compliance of the judgment of
            <lb />
            Division Bench of this Court.
            <lb />
            Learned counsel has further made a reference of the
            <lb />
            report of SBC Commission to show that a proper procedure
            <lb />
            was adopted to get relevant quantifiable data. Nine factors
            <lb />
            were
            <lb />
            taken
            <lb />
            into
            <lb />
            consideration
            <lb />
            before
            <lb />
            making
            <lb />
            recommendations. Chapter Six of the report talks about
            <lb />
            traditional and social background of five castes, whereas,
            <lb />
            Chapter nine makes analysis of quantifiable data.
            <lb />
            The reference of indicators adopted by the IDS has
            <lb />
            rightly been taken into consideration, though the report of
            <lb />
            IDS was earlier held to be not reliable. The details were still
            <lb />
            relevant, thus taken into consideration to show inadequate
            <lb />
            representation
            <lb />
            in
            <lb />

            <lb />
            Learned counsel Dr. Manish Singhvi, appearing for
            <lb />
            Gadiya Lohars, has also opposed the writ petitions. It is
            <lb />
            submitted that the argument of ceiling of 50 per cent
            <lb />
            advanced in the case of Indra Sahwney (supra) is no longer
            <lb />
            applicable after 81 st amendment in the Constitution of India.

            The object and reasons in bringing 81 st amendment in
            <lb />
            the Constitution of India was referred. A reference of
            <lb />
            judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Indra Sahwney
            <lb />
            (supra) has been given where ceiling of 50 per cent was taken
            <lb />
            as a general rule without exclusion of backlog vacancies. The
            <lb />
            purpose of Article 16(4B) of the Constitution of India is not
            <lb />
            to apply as ceiling of 50 per cent on backlog vacancies . It was
            <lb />
            to overcome from the judgment in the case of Indra Sahwney
            <lb />
            (supra). The ceiling of 50 per cent on the vacancies of a given
            <lb />
            year can be complied by carry forward of excess vacancies
            <lb />
            above 50 per cent. Even ceiling of 50 per cent emphasised by
            <lb />
            the Apex Court in the case of Indra Sahwney (supra) is with
            <lb />
            just exception. The Apex Court in the subsequent judgment
            <lb />
            has permitted reservation above 50 per cent, if
            <lb />
            extraordinary reasons exists thus reservation beyond 50 per
            <lb />
            cent is permissible.
            <lb />
            Learned counsel Dr.Manish Singhvi has made a
            <lb />
            reference of Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India, which
            <lb />
            provides reservation in educational institutions. The aforesaid
            <lb />
            provision is not subject to Article 16(4B) of the Constitution
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            40
            <lb />
            of India. Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India does not
            <lb />
            provide ceiling, as alleged to have been imposed under Article
            <lb />
            16(4B) of the Constitution of India, yet it has been
            <lb />
            challenged by the petitioners.
            <lb />
            In the case of M.Nagaraj &amp; Ors. (supra), the Apex
            <lb />
            Court has taken cognizance of excessive reservation. The
            <lb />
            extent of reservation has been left open and to be decided on
            <lb />
            the facts of each case. The aforesaid judgment was
            <lb />
            subsequent to the constitutional amendment thus applies to
            <lb />
            the present case. The judgment in the case of S.V. Joshi
            <lb />
            (supra) permits reservation beyond 50 percent if quantifiable
            <lb />
            data exists. In the case of Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra), the
            <lb />
            State Authorities failed to supply quantifiable data to
            <lb />
            support reservation beyond 50 percent thus judgment
            <lb />
            aforesaid was given on its own facts.
            <lb />
            A reference of judgment of Division Bench of this
            <lb />
            Court in Special Appeal No.13491/2009 dated 22 nd February,
            <lb />
            2010 has also been given to show that reservation beyond 50
            <lb />
            percent is permitted if quantifiable data are available. In the
            <lb />
            background aforesaid, neither the Constitution of India nor
            <lb />
            the Apex Court and even this Court have put a cap of 50 per
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            41
            <lb />
            cent on reservation for admission in the institutions and
            <lb />
            service.
            <lb />
            The argument on the scope of judicial review of the
            <lb />
            report of the SBC Commission has also been made. In the
            <lb />
            case of Ram Singh (supra), it is held that recommendation of
            <lb />
            the expert committee is ordinarily binding on the State
            <lb />
            Government. In the present case, the SBC Commission has
            <lb />
            given a detailed report by making out an exceptional case for
            <lb />
            5 per cent reservation to special backward classes. The
            <lb />
            report was accepted by the Government to provide
            <lb />
            reservation thus the Court should be slow to interfere in the
            <lb />
            recommendations made by the SBC Commission being an
            <lb />
            expert body. The judicial review of the report is not
            <lb />
            permissible. The petitioners have made reference of those
            <lb />
            judgments where the Court interfered in the reservation
            <lb />
            because quantifiable data were not collected by the State
            <lb />
            Government prior to reservation in services.
            <lb />
            In case of Himachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribes
            <lb />
            Employees Federation &amp; Anr. Vs. Himachal Pradesh
            <lb />
            Samanaya Varg Karamchari Kalyan Mahasandh &amp; Ors.
            <lb />
            reported in (2013) 10 SCC 308, the Supreme Court
            <lb />
            42
            <lb />
            permitted reservation once the quantifiable datas are made
            <lb />
            available, which is the case herein also. In the case of Sardar
            <lb />
            Inder Singh Vs. State of Rajasthan reported in 1957 SCR
            <lb />
            605, it is held that matters, exclusively in the domain of
            <lb />
            legislature, are not open for determination by the Court.
            <lb />
            Learned counsel has shown element of &quot;public interest&quot;
            <lb />
            for special reservation to Gadiya Lohars looking to their
            <lb />
            historical background and other elements. The Constitution of
            <lb />
            India is required to be taken into consideration apart from
            <lb />
            the recommendations of the Justice Venkatachaliah
            <lb />
            Commission on working of Indian Constitution.
            <lb />
            A reference of judgment of the Apex Court in the case
            <lb />
            of Workmen Vs. Meenakshi Mills Ltd. reported in (1992) 3
            <lb />
            SCC 336 has also been given. The judgment in the case of
            <lb />
            Indra Sahwney (supra) also permits reservation beyond 50
            <lb />
            per cent. The Gadiya Lohar is a &quot;Nomadic&quot; community thus
            <lb />
            needs special treatment for their advancement. A reference
            <lb />
            of recommendations of Justice Lokur Committee to justify
            <lb />
            the report of the SBC Commission so as the Notification
            <lb />
            under challenge has been given. The National Commission has
            <lb />
            also stated Gadiya Lohars of Eastern Rajasthan to be
            <lb />
            43
            <lb />
            &quot;Nomadic&quot;.
            <lb />
            Justice Jasraj Chopra Committee and Kaka Kelkar
            <lb />
            Committee have also highlighted and recommended for special
            <lb />
            treatment to Gadiya Lohars. The plight of the community has
            <lb />
            been considered by the SBC Commission in its report to
            <lb />
            provide special reservation to them.
            <lb />
            It is also urged that even if there are deficiencies in
            <lb />
            the SBC Commission report, it may be ignored as they are not
            <lb />
            significant. The Gadiya Lohars are socially as well as
            <lb />
            educationally backward having inadequate representation in
            <lb />
            services and in the educational institutions.
            <lb />
            The clarification about reservation in OBC and SBC
            <lb />
            categories to five castes has also been made. It is submitted
            <lb />
            that after 5 per cent special reservation to five castes, they
            <lb />
            would not be entitled to the reservation meant for OBC and
            <lb />
            one percent surviving under the Act of 2008. The five castes
            <lb />
            would be entitled to the reservation only in their own
            <lb />
            category created in pursuance of the Act of 2015 thus
            <lb />
            confusion created by the petitioners is without any basis and
            <lb />
            otherwise to be clarified by this Court. Looking to the
            <lb />
            aforesaid, the writ petitions deserve to be dismissed.

            The bunch of writ petitions have been filed to challenge

            the Notification dated 16 th October, 2015 and the Act of
            <lb />
            2015. The writ petitions also challenge the order dated 06 th
            <lb />
            May, 2010 to provide one percent reservation in favour of
            <lb />
            special backward classes and also the report dated 15 th
            <lb />
            December, 2007 given by Justice Jasraj Chopra (retired)

            A challenge to the OBC Commission report of
            <lb />
            November, 2012 has also been made in one writ petition with
            <lb />
            further prayer to constitute a permanent statutory body as
            <lb />
            per directions of the Apex Court in the case of Indra
            <lb />
            Sawhney (supra).
            <lb />
            The challenge to the aforesaid is made on various
            <lb />
            grounds, however, before considering the issues raised by the
            <lb />
            petitioners, it would be proper to give facts of the case.

        <p>
            (1) Resume of the facts :-
            <lb />
            An agitation was made by the Gurjars/Gujjars in the
            <lb />
            State of Rajasthan to include them in the category of
            <lb />
            45
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes. It affected law and order in the State. It
            <lb />
            even affected Railways as well as road transport. An
            <lb />
            agreement was entered between Gurjars/Gujjars and the
            <lb />
            State of Rajasthan and, thereupon, a Notification dated 07 th
            <lb />
            June, 2007 was issued to constitute High Powered
            <lb />
            Committee. Justice Jasraj Chopra (retired) was nominated as
            <lb />
            Chairperson of the Committee. The State Government, vide
            <lb />
            Notification dated 12 th June, 2007, laid down the term of

            category of Scheduled Tribes, this Committee
            <lb />
            would systematically examine the demand of
            <lb />
            Gujjars caste by carefully studying different
            <lb />
            representations and opinion in this regard
            <lb />
            received by it and as per the report to the

            The High Powered Committee submitted its
            <lb />
            report on 15 th December, 2007. The State Government
            <lb />
            considered the said report and, thereupon, the Rajasthan

            reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes
            <lb />
            and Backward Classes was maintained to the extent of 16, 12
            <lb />

            <lb />
            provided for special backward class, whereas, 14 per cent for
            <lb />
            economically backward classes. The State Government,
            <lb />

            <lb />
            above 50 per cent.
            <lb />
            The writ petition bearing No.13491/2009 and

            this Court found that High Powered Committee headed by
            <lb />
            Justice Jasraj Chopra (retired) did not provide adequate
            <lb />
            data. The writ petition was disposed of with the following
            <lb />
            directions, which are summarised hereunder :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            (i) The Government shall revisit Sections 3 &amp; 4 of the

            Act of 2008 in the light of the relevant judgments of
            <lb />

            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (ii) The State Government should also consider the
            <lb />

            <lb />
            Committee and of the SBC Commission. It is not only in
            <lb />
            reference to constitutional provisions but the judgments of
            <lb />
            the Apex Court. The objections to the maintainability of the
            <lb />
            writ petition/s have been raised.

            It is alleged that the writ petition has been filed
            <lb />
            52
            <lb />
            without showing infringement of fundamental or legal rights.
            <lb />
            The petitioner Captain Gurvinder Singh and others do not fall
            <lb />
            in the definition of &quot;person aggrieved&quot;, thus they have no
            <lb />
            locus to challenge the Notification as well as the Act of 2015.
            <lb />
            The petitioners have neither applied for admission in the
            <lb />
            educational courses nor are in service. The petitioners are
            <lb />
            thus busy bodies and, otherwise, it is not a Public Interest
            <lb />
            Litigation, which can be maintained other than by the &quot;person
            <lb />
            aggrieved&quot;.
            <lb />
            Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that
            <lb />
            objection has been taken for the sake of it. Captain Gurvinder
            <lb />
            Singh and others were the petitioners in Writ Petition
            <lb />
            No.13491/2009 as well as in subsequent Writ Petition
            <lb />
            No.1862/2013. The writ petition No.13491/2009 was decided
            <lb />
            vide judgment dated 22 nd December, 2010 with a direction to
            <lb />
            revisit certain provisions and matter to be sent to the
            <lb />
            Commission. The issues raised therein were kept open by the
            <lb />
            Court with liberty to raise it again, if so required. The
            <lb />
            petitioners were given opportunities before the SBC
            <lb />
            Commission. They participated in the proceedings before the
            <lb />
            SBC Commission and nobody raised an objection to their
            <lb />
            53
            <lb />
            locus standi. Two other petitioners are in government
            <lb />
            services, thus are &quot;person aggrieved&quot;. The petitioner, in
            <lb />
            person, Mr.Shrawan Singh Tanwar has even challenged the
            <lb />
            SBC Commission report, being aggrieved by it. The petitioner
            <lb />
            No.4 in the case of Captain Gurvinder Singh &amp; Ors. is a
            <lb />
            registered society. The object of the society is to work for
            <lb />
            equality amongst the citizens. It is to oppose casteism,
            <lb />
            religionism, communalism, etc., thus has maintained the writ
            <lb />
            petition to challenge the Notification dated 16 th October,
            <lb />
            2015 and the Act of 2015, which infringes Articles 15(4) and
            <lb />
            16(4B) of the Constitution of India.
            <lb />
            Captain Gurvinder Singh and others were the
            <lb />
            petitioners in Writ Petition No.13491/2009 decided by this

            Court vide its order dated 22 nd December, 2010 along with

            two other writ petitions. The said writ petition was not
            <lb />
            dismissed on the ground of locus standi of the petitioners,
            <lb />
            rather, perusal of operative portion of the order dated 22 nd
            <lb />
            December, 2010 shows a direction to provide an opportunity
            <lb />

            <lb />
            before SBC Commission. The operative portion of the order

            petitions were rendered infructuous in view of the
            <lb />
            Notification and the Act under challenge but after noticing
            <lb />
            pendency of the present writ petition. The petitioners were
            <lb />
            given liberty to raise all the issues in the present writ
            <lb />
            petition.
            <lb />
            The directions given in both the judgments were not
            <lb />
            assailed by any of the parties, thus became final. In the light
            <lb />
            of the aforesaid, Captain Gurvinder Singh and others cannot
            <lb />
            be non-suited on the ground of their locus. It is moreso when
            <lb />
            petitioner No.4 is a registered society, which is created with
            <lb />
            the object to claim equality amongst the citizens thus it
            <lb />
            cannot be said that petitioners do not fall in the definition of
            <lb />
            &quot;person aggrieved&quot;.
            <lb />
            The respondent No.4 has given reference of the
            <lb />
            judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Calcutta Gas
            <lb />
            Company Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and also in the case of Ayaabkhan
            <lb />
            Noorkhan Pathan (supra) to support his arguments. The
            <lb />
            judgment aforesaid has no application to the facts of this
            <lb />
            case.
            <lb />
            In the case of Ayaabkhan Noorkhan Pathan (supra), the
            <lb />
            challenge was to a caste certificate of an individual in the
            <lb />
            hands of a stranger. The Apex Court held that stranger
            <lb />
            should not be permitted to meddle in the proceedings against
            <lb />
            an individual unless he falls in the category of aggrieved
            <lb />
            person. The legal right of the petitioners herein has been
            <lb />
            canvassed. The petitioner Nos. 2 &amp; 3 in the petition of
            <lb />
            Captain Gurvinder Singh &amp; Ors. are in service, thus affected
            <lb />
            by reservation to special backward classes and the petitioner
            <lb />
            No.4 is a registered society to espouse the cause for equality.
            <lb />
            Their legal rights have been earlier recognised, thus not only
            <lb />
            this Court but the SBC Commission has given opportunity of
            <lb />
            hearing to them, hence, the objection regarding
            <lb />
            maintainability of the writ petition on the ground of locus
            <lb />
            standi of the petitioners cannot be accepted. Accordingly,
            <lb />
            the objection regarding maintainability of the writ petition
            <lb />
            on the ground of locus standi is decided against the private
            <lb />
            respondents.
            <lb />
            The second objection is in regard to maintainability of
            <lb />
            the writ petition in absence of challenge to the report of SBC
            <lb />
            Commission.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (3) In absence of challenge to the report of SBC
            <lb />
            Commission, the consequential Notification and the Act of
            <lb />
            2015 cannot be challenged :-
            <lb />
            Learned counsel for the private respondents submitted
            <lb />
            that in absence of challenge to the report of the SBC
            <lb />
            Commission, the Notification dated 16 th October, 2015 and
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            58
            <lb />
            the Act of 2015 cannot be challenged. When the enactment is
            <lb />
            on the basis of recommendation of the SBC Commission, it
            <lb />
            was necessary for the petitioners to first challenge the
            <lb />
            report of the SBC Commission and then to challenge the
            <lb />
            Notification and the Act of 2015. A reference of the
            <lb />
            judgment in the case of Edukanti Kistamma (Dead) through
            <lb />
            LRs. (supra) has been given.
            <lb />
            Learned counsel for the petitioners have contested the
            <lb />
            issue in reference to the earlier litigation where the report
            <lb />
            of the SBC Commission was also challenged and, while
            <lb />
            disposing the said writ petition, bearing No.1862/2013, a
            <lb />
            liberty was given to the petitioners to raise all the issues in
            <lb />
            the present writ petition.
            <lb />
            We have considered second objection and find that in
            <lb />
            the writ petition preferred by Captain Gurvinder Singh and
            <lb />
            others, a challenge to the report of SBC Commission has not
            <lb />
            been made though the grounds have been raised. In the case
            <lb />
            of Shrawan Singh Tanwar, a challenge to the report of the
            <lb />
            SBC Commission has also been made. The bunch of the
            <lb />
            petitions has been taken together for hearing with the
            <lb />
            consent of learned counsel for the parties. In view of the
            <lb />
            59
            <lb />
            challenge to the report of the SBC Commission in one writ
            <lb />
            petition heard along with connected writ petitions, second
            <lb />
            objection is of no substance. Accordingly, the judgment in the
            <lb />
            case of Edukanti Kistamma (Dead) through LRs (supra) has no
            <lb />
            application to the facts of this case.
            <lb />
            It is necessary to observe that Notification dated 16 th
            <lb />
            October, 2015 and the Act of 2015 have been challenged not
            <lb />
            only in reference to the report of the SBC Commission but
            <lb />
            also in reference to Articles 15(4) and 16(4B) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India. It is even in reference to the
            <lb />
            judgments of the Apex Court. The scrutiny of legal issues in
            <lb />
            reference to the constitutional provisions and the judgments
            <lb />
            of the Apex Court needs to be made thus writ petitions are
            <lb />
            otherwise maintainable. It cannot be accepted that unless the
            <lb />
            SBC Commission report is challenged, the Act of 2015 cannot
            <lb />
            be assailed even on legal grounds and, otherwise, the report
            <lb />
            of the SBC Commission has been challenged in one writ
            <lb />
            petition.
            <lb />
            In the light of the aforesaid, second objection
            <lb />
            regarding maintainability of the writ petitions is also
            <lb />
            rejected.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            The State of Rajasthan has not raised objection
            <lb />
            regarding maintainability of the writ petitions. It seems to be
            <lb />
            for the reasons given above.
            <lb />
            All the issues raised by the petitioners and
            <lb />
            defended by the respondents need elaborate discussion. This
            <lb />
            Court has formulated following issues for its consideration :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            (I) (A)
            <lb />
            Whether ceiling of 50 per
            <lb />
            cent exists on reservation in public
            <lb />
            employment as well as for admission in
            <lb />
            the educational institutions in view of
            <lb />
            the judgment of the Apex Court?
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (B) Whether reservation can be based
            <lb />
            on caste?
        </item>
        <lb />
        <p>
            The petitioners have challenged the Notification
            <lb />
            dated 16 th October, 2015 and the Act of 2015 apart from the
            <lb />
            report of the SBC Commission providing reservation beyond
            <lb />
            50 per cent in educational institutions as well as in public
            <lb />
            employment.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            A reference of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India have been given apart from the
            <lb />
            amendment made thereunder from time to time. The
            <lb />
            judgments of the Apex Court as well as this Court apart from
            <lb />
            other High Courts have been cited to substantiate the
            <lb />
            arguments. The respondents have countered it by giving
            <lb />
            interpretation to the provisions of the Constitution of India
            <lb />
            and relied the judgments of the Apex Court.
            <lb />
            The issue aforesaid needs elaborate discussion
            <lb />
            not only in reference to the judgments of the Apex Court but
            <lb />
            the amendment made in the Constitution of India. It is, more
            <lb />
            specifically, 81 st amendment in the Constitution of India after
            <lb />
            the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Indra
            <lb />
            Sawheny (supra). For ready reference, Articles 15 and 16 of

            the State in favour of the Scheduled
            <lb />
            Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which,
            <lb />
            in the opinion of the State, are not

            adequately represented in the services

            (4B) Nothing in this article shall prevent
            <lb />
            the State from considering any unfilled
            <lb />
            vacancies of a year which are reserved
            <lb />
            for being filled up in that year in
            <lb />
            accordance with any provision for
            <lb />
            reservation made under clause (4) or
            <lb />
            clause (4A) as a separate class of
            <lb />
            vacancies to be filled up in any
            <lb />
            succeeding year or years and such class
            <lb />
            of vacancies shall not be considered
            <lb />
            together with the vacancies of the year
            <lb />
            in which they are being filled up for
            <lb />
            determining the ceiling of fifty per cent.
            <lb />
            Reservation on total number of
            <lb />
            vacancies of that year.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (5) Nothing in this article shall affect
            <lb />
            the operation of any law which
            <lb />
            provides that the incumbent of an
            <lb />
            office in connection with the affairs
            <lb />
            of any religious or denominational
            <lb />
            institution or any member of the
            <lb />
            governing body thereof shall be a
            <lb />
            person professing a particular religion
            <lb />
            or
            <lb />
            belonging
            <lb />
            to
            <lb />
            a
            <lb />
            particular
            <lb />
            denomination.&quot;
            <lb />
            Article 15 of the Constitution prohibits
            <lb />
            discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or
            <lb />
            place of birth etc. Clause (3) of Article 15, however, permits
            <lb />
            the Government to make special provision for women and
            <lb />
            children. Clause (4) of Article 15 permits the State
            <lb />
            Government to make special provision for advancement of
            <lb />
            socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for
            <lb />
            the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The word
            <lb />
            &quot;socially and educationally backward classes of citizens&quot; has
            <lb />
            been used and not the socially and educationally backward
            <lb />
            &quot;caste&quot; so as to avoid discrimination on the ground of religion
            <lb />
            or caste. We find that the word &quot;classes of citizens&quot; has
            <lb />
            been made interchangeable with the word &quot;caste&quot; to identify
            <lb />
            socially and economically backward classes. The practice to
            <lb />
            identify the caste for the &quot;classes of citizens&quot; has been
            <lb />
            adopted from the beginning. It is in ignorance of the
            <lb />
            constitutional mandate. The framers of the Constitution
            <lb />
            66
            <lb />
            never thought to divide society by caste or religion thus
            <lb />
            specific prohibition for it was provided in Articles 15 and 16
            <lb />
            of the Constitution.
            <lb />
            The caste system is prevalent from the beginning
            <lb />
            and was even in the knowledge of the framers of the
            <lb />
            Constitution thus only Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution
            <lb />
            put a bar on discrimination based on caste and religion to
            <lb />
            avoid division of country by caste. While making amendment in
            <lb />
            Article 15 to bring Article 15(4) of the Constitution,
            <lb />
            Parliament was cautious in using the word &quot;classes of
            <lb />
            citizens&quot;. Clause (4) of Article 15 of the Constitution was
            <lb />
            brought to see advancement of socially and educationally
            <lb />
            backward classes of citizens. The time has come to adhere to
            <lb />
            the provisions of the Constitution in strict terms without
            <lb />
            substitution of the word &quot;classes of citizens&quot; by &quot;caste of
            <lb />
            citizens&quot;.
            <lb />
            The reservation in educational courses as well as
            <lb />
            public employment is prevalent for more than last six decades
            <lb />
            and there is no exclusion of any caste, rather, there exists
            <lb />
            inclusion of certain castes.
            <lb />
            It is expected of the Central as well as the State
            <lb />
            67
            <lb />
            Governments to revisit the system of reservation so that
            <lb />
            socially and educationally backward classes of citizens can be
            <lb />
            uplifted within time frame. It is by framing a proper policy.
            <lb />
            The issue aforesaid was discussed by the Apex Court in the
            <lb />
            case of M.R. Balaji &amp; Ors. (supra). It is by providing financial
            <lb />
            and other assistance to attract classes, who are socially or
            <lb />
            educationally backward. The advancement of those categories
            <lb />
            of citizens may not be only by way of reservation but by
            <lb />
            evolving other methods as well. The financial assistance for
            <lb />
            education would be for upliftment of the citizens with overall
            <lb />
            development and, in doing so, they would not require any
            <lb />
            reservation in due course of time resulting in overall
            <lb />
            development of the country itself.
            <lb />
            The reservation should not be provided to achieve
            <lb />
            political goals as it results in caste based agitation to bargain
            <lb />
            with the Government. It was recently seen in the State of
            <lb />
            Haryana where agitators disrupted normal life of the
            <lb />
            citizens.
            <lb />
            It is time to review the policy by the legislature
            <lb />
            with an aim to achieve the objects, for which, Constitution
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            68
            <lb />
            was framed and, while doing so, Preamble of the Constitution
            <lb />
            should be kept in mind. The Preamble refers to sovereign,
            <lb />
            socialist, secular, democratic republic with equality of status
            <lb />
            and liberty. The equality of status has been reflected in
            <lb />
            Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The issue
            <lb />
            raised by the petitioners in reference to Articles 15(4) or
            <lb />
            16(4B) of the Constitution is to be viewed after keeping in
            <lb />
            mind the Preamble of the Constitution of India. It is apart
            <lb />
            from the judgments of the Apex Court on the issue.
            <lb />
            The judgment in the case of M.R. Balaji &amp; Ors.
            <lb />
            (supra) is in reference to Article 15(4) of the Constitution of
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            India. In the said case, the State of Mysore was endeavoring
            <lb />
            since 1958 to make special reservation for advancement of
            <lb />
            socially and educationally backward classes of citizens. The
            <lb />
            orders and Notifications for it were always challenged before
            <lb />
            the Court, since then. The Apex Court found that the
            <lb />
            Commission therein should have taken into consideration not
            <lb />
            only traditional apathy but poverty and lack of education in
            <lb />
            rural areas apart from many other issues to find out socially
            <lb />
            and educationally backwardness of classes of citizens. It was
            <lb />
            found that the Nagana Gowda Committee, constituted by the
            <lb />
            69
            <lb />
            State Government, had taken &quot;caste&quot; to be sole basis for
            <lb />
            determination of socially and educationally backwardness of
            <lb />
            the classes of citizens. It has also reiterated requirement of
            <lb />
            both, socially and educationally backwardness, to attract
            <lb />
            Article 15(4) of the Constitution of India. In paras 21 to 29
            <lb />
            of the judgment in the case of M.R. Balaji &amp; Ors. (supra), the
            <lb />
            issue of reservation, solely based on caste, has been
            <lb />
            criticised and thereupon paras 30 to 34 deal with the extent
            <lb />
            of reservation. Paras 21 to 23, 25, 29, 34, 35, 37 of the said
            <lb />
            judgment are quoted hereunder for ready reference :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>&quot;</p>

        <p>
            21. In considering the scope and extent of the
            <lb />
            expression &quot;backward classes&quot; under Art. 15(4),
            <lb />
            it is necessary to remember that the concept of
            <lb />
            backwardness is not intended to be relative in
            <lb />
            the sense that any classes who are backward in
            <lb />
            relation to the most advanced classes of the
            <lb />
            society should be included in it. In such relative
            <lb />
            tests were to be applied by reason of the most
            <lb />
            advanced classes, there would be several layers
            <lb />
            or strata of backward classes and each one of
            <lb />
            them may claim to be included under Art.15(4).
            <lb />
            This position is not disputed before us by the
            <lb />
            learned Advocate-General for the State. The
            <lb />
            backwardness under Art.15(4) must be social
            <lb />
            and educational. It is not either social or
            <lb />
            educational, but it is both social and educational;
            <lb />
            70
            <lb />
            and that takes us to the question as to how
            <lb />
            social and educational backwardness has to be
            <lb />
            determined.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            22. Let us take the question of social
            <lb />
            backwardness first. By what test should it
            <lb />
            be decided whether a particular class is
            <lb />
            socially backward or not ? The group of
            <lb />
            citizens to whom Article 15(4) applies are
            <lb />
            described as &apos;classes of citizens&apos;, not as
            <lb />
            castes of citizens. A class, according to
            <lb />
            the dictionary meaning, shows division of
            <lb />
            society according to status, rank or caste.
            <lb />
            In the Hindu social structure, caste
            <lb />
            unfortunately plays an important part in
            <lb />
            determining the status of the citizen.
            <lb />
            Though according to sociologists and Vedic
            <lb />
            scholars, the caste system may have
            <lb />
            originally begun on occupational or
            <lb />
            functional basis, in course of time, it
            <lb />
            became rigid and inflexible. The history of
            <lb />
            the growth of caste system shows that its
            <lb />
            original functional and occupational basis
            <lb />
            was
            <lb />
            later
            <lb />
            over-burdened
            <lb />
            with
            <lb />
            considerations of purity based on ritual
            <lb />
            concepts, and that led to its ramifications
            <lb />
            which introduced inflexibility and rigidity.
            <lb />
            This artificial growth inevitably tended to
            <lb />
            create a feeling of superiority and
            <lb />
            inferiority and to foster narrow caste
            <lb />
            71
            <lb />
            loyalties. Therefore, in dealing with the
            <lb />
            question as to whether any class of
            <lb />
            citizens is socially backward or not, it may
            <lb />
            not be irrelevant to consider the caste of
            <lb />
            the said group of citizens. In this
            <lb />
            connection, it is, however, necessary to
            <lb />
            bear in mind that the special provision is
            <lb />
            contemplated for classes of citizens and
            <lb />
            not for individual citizens as such, and so,
            <lb />
            though the caste of the group of citizens
            <lb />
            may be relevant, its importance should not
            <lb />
            be exaggerated. If the classification of
            <lb />
            backward classes of citizens was based
            <lb />
            solely on the caste of the citizen, it may
            <lb />
            not always be logical and may perhaps
            <lb />
            contain the vice of perpetuating the caste
            <lb />
            themselves.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            23. Besides, if the caste of the group of
            <lb />
            citizens was made the sole basis for
            <lb />
            determining the social backwardness of
            <lb />
            the said group, that test would inevitably
            <lb />
            break down in relation to many sections of
            <lb />
            Indian society which do not recognise
            <lb />
            castes in the conventional sense known to
            <lb />
            Hindu society. How is one going to decide
            <lb />
            whether Muslims, Christians or Jains, or
            <lb />
            even Lingayats are socially backward or
            <lb />
            not ? The test of castes would be
            <lb />
            inapplicable to those groups, but that
            <lb />
            72
            <lb />
            would hardly justify the exclusion of
            <lb />
            these group in toto from the operation of
            <lb />
            Art. 15(4). It is not unlikely that in some
            <lb />
            States some Muslims or Christians or
            <lb />
            Jains forming groups may be socially
            <lb />
            backward. That is why we think that
            <lb />
            though castes in relation to Hindus may
            <lb />
            be a relevant factor to consider in
            <lb />
            determining the social backwardness of
            <lb />
            groups or classes of citizens, it cannot be
            <lb />
            made the sole or the dominant test in
            <lb />
            that behalf. Social backwardness is on the
            <lb />
            ultimate analysis the result of poverty, to
            <lb />
            a very large extent. The classes of
            <lb />
            citizens who are deplorably poor
            <lb />
            automatically become socially backward.
            <lb />
            They do not enjoy a status in society and
            <lb />
            have, therefore, to be content to take a
            <lb />
            backward seat. It is true that social
            <lb />
            backwardness which results from poverty
            <lb />
            is
            <lb />
            likely
            <lb />
            to
            <lb />
            be
            <lb />
            aggravated
            <lb />
            by
            <lb />
            considerations of caste to which the poor
            <lb />
            citizens may belong, but that only shows
            <lb />
            the relevance of both caste and poverty
            <lb />
            in determining the backwardness of
            <lb />
            citizens.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            25.
            <lb />
            What then is the test applied by the
            <lb />
            State in passing the impugned order ? We
            <lb />
            have already seen that the Nagan Gowda
            <lb />
            73
            <lb />
            Committee appointed by the State was
            <lb />
            inclined to treat the caste as almost the
            <lb />
            sole basis in determining the question
            <lb />
            about the social backwardness of any
            <lb />
            community. The Committee has no doubt
            <lb />
            incidentally referred to the general
            <lb />
            economic condition of the community as a
            <lb />
            contributory factor; but the manner in
            <lb />
            which it has enumerated the backward
            <lb />
            and more backward classes leaves no room
            <lb />
            for doubt that the predominant, if not
            <lb />
            the sole, test that weighted in their minds
            <lb />
            was the test of caste. When we consider
            <lb />
            the impugned order itself, the position
            <lb />
            becomes absolutely clear. The impugned
            <lb />
            order has adopted the earlier order of
            <lb />
            July 10, 1961, with some changes as to the
            <lb />
            quantum of reservation, and so, it is
            <lb />
            necessary to examine the earlier order in
            <lb />
            order to see what test was applied by the
            <lb />
            State in classifying the backward Classes.
            <lb />
            In its preamble, the order of July 10,
            <lb />
            1961, clearly and unambiguously states
            <lb />
            that the Committee had come to the
            <lb />
            conclusion
            <lb />
            that
            <lb />
            in
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            present
            <lb />
            circumstances, the only practicable
            <lb />
            method of classifying the Backward
            <lb />
            Classes in the State is on the basis of
            <lb />
            castes and communities and the State
            <lb />
            Government accepts this test. In other
            <lb />
            74
            <lb />
            words, on the order as it stands there can
            <lb />
            be no room for doubt that the
            <lb />
            classification of backward and more
            <lb />
            backward classes was made by the State
            <lb />
            Government only on the basis of their
            <lb />
            castes which basis was regarded as a
            <lb />
            practicable method. It is true that in
            <lb />
            support of the inclusion of the Lingayats
            <lb />
            amongst the Backward Classes the order
            <lb />
            refers to some other factors, but neither
            <lb />
            the Report of the Nagan Gowda
            <lb />
            Committee, nor the orders passed by the
            <lb />
            State Government on July 10, 1961, and
            <lb />
            July 31, 1962, afford any indication as to
            <lb />
            how any test other than that the caste
            <lb />
            was applied in deciding the question. The
            <lb />
            learned Advocate-General has contended
            <lb />
            that the statement in the preamble of the
            <lb />
            order of July 10, 1961 should not be
            <lb />
            literally construed and he has argued that
            <lb />
            the words used in the relevant portion are
            <lb />
            inartistic and he has suggested that the
            <lb />
            order is not based on the sole basis of
            <lb />
            castes. We are not impressed by this
            <lb />
            argument. We have considered both the
            <lb />
            orders in the light of the Report and the
            <lb />
            recommendations made by the Nagan
            <lb />
            Gowda Committee and we are satisfied
            <lb />
            that the classification of the socially
            <lb />
            backward classes of citizens made by the
            <lb />
            75
            <lb />
            State proceeds on the only consideration
            <lb />
            of their castes without regard to the
            <lb />
            other factors which are undoubtedly
            <lb />
            relevant. If that be so, the social
            <lb />
            backwardness of the communities to
            <lb />
            whom the impugned order applies has been
            <lb />
            determined in a manner which is not
            <lb />
            permissible under Art. 15(4) and that
            <lb />
            itself would introduce an infirmity which
            <lb />
            is fatal to the validity of the said
            <lb />
            classification.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            29.
            <lb />
            In this connection, it is necessary to add
            <lb />
            that the sub-classification made by order
            <lb />
            between Backward Classes and More
            <lb />
            Backward Classes does not appear to be
            <lb />
            justified
            <lb />
            under
            <lb />
            Art. 15(4).
            <lb />
            Art. 15(4) authorises special provision
            <lb />
            being made for the really backward
            <lb />
            classes. In introducing two categories of
            <lb />
            Backward Classes, what the impugned
            <lb />
            order, in substance, purports to do is to
            <lb />
            devise measures for the benefit of all the
            <lb />
            classes of citizens who are less advanced,
            <lb />
            compared to the most advanced classes in
            <lb />
            the State, and that, in our opinion, is not
            <lb />
            the scope of Art. 15(4). The result of the
            <lb />
            method adopted by the impugned order is
            <lb />
            that nearly 90% of the population of the
            <lb />
            State is treated as backward, and that
            <lb />
            illustrates how the order in fact divides
            <lb />
            76
            <lb />
            the population of the State into most
            <lb />
            advanced and the rest, and puts the
            <lb />
            latter into two categories of Backward
            <lb />
            and More Backward. The classification of
            <lb />
            the two categories, therefore, is not
            <lb />
            warranted by Art. 15(4).

            34.
            <lb />
            The
            <lb />
            learned Advocate-General
            <lb />
            has
            <lb />
            suggested that reservation of a large
            <lb />
            number of seats for the weaker sections
            <lb />
            of the society would not affect either
            <lb />
            the death or efficiency of scholarship at
            <lb />
            all, and in support of this argument, he
            <lb />
            has relied on the observations made by
            <lb />
            the Backward Classes Commission that it
            <lb />
            found no complaint in the States of
            <lb />
            Madras, Andhra, Travancore-Cochin and
            <lb />
            Mysore where the system of recruiting
            <lb />
            candidates from other Backward Classes
            <lb />
            to the reserve quota has been in vogue
            <lb />
            for several decades. The Committee
            <lb />
            further
            <lb />
            observed
            <lb />
            that
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            representatives of the upper classes did
            <lb />
            not complain about any lack of efficiency
            <lb />
            in the offices recruited by reservation (p.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            135). This opinion, however, is plainly
            <lb />
            inconsistent with what is bound to be the
            <lb />
            inevitable consequence of reservation in
            <lb />
            higher university education. If admission
            <lb />
            to professional and technical colleges is
            <lb />
            77
            <lb />
            unduly liberalised it would be idle to
            <lb />
            contend that the quality of our graduates
            <lb />
            will not suffer. That is not to say that
            <lb />
            reservation should not be adopted;
            <lb />
            reservation should and must be adopted
            <lb />
            to advance the prospects of the weaker
            <lb />
            sections of society, but in providing for
            <lb />
            special measures in that behalf care
            <lb />
            should be taken not to exclude admission
            <lb />
            to higher educational centers to
            <lb />
            deserving and qualified candidates of
            <lb />
            other communities. A special provision
            <lb />
            contemplated
            <lb />
            by
            <lb />
            Art. 15(4) like
            <lb />
            reservation of posts and appointments
            <lb />
            contemplated by Art. 16(4) must be
            <lb />
            within reasonable limits. The interests of
            <lb />
            weaker sections of society which are a
            <lb />
            first charge on the states and the
            <lb />
            centers have to be adjusted with the
            <lb />
            interests of the community as a whole.
            <lb />
            The adjustment of these competing
            <lb />
            claims is undoubtedly a difficult matter,
            <lb />
            but if under the guise of making a special
            <lb />
            provision, a State reserves practically all
            <lb />
            the seats available in all the colleges, that
            <lb />
            clearly would be subverting the object of
            <lb />
            Art. 15(4). In this matter again, we are
            <lb />
            reluctant to say definitely what would be
            <lb />
            a proper provision to make. Speaking
            <lb />
            generally and in a broad way, a special
            <lb />
            78
            <lb />
            provision should be less than 50%; how
            <lb />
            much less than 50% would depend upon
            <lb />
            the relevant prevailing circumstances in
            <lb />
            each case. In this particular case it is
            <lb />
            remarkable that when the State issued
            <lb />
            its order on July 10, 1961, it emphatically
            <lb />
            expressed its opinion that the reservation
            <lb />
            of 68% recommended by the Nagan
            <lb />
            Gowda Committee would not be larger
            <lb />
            interests of the State. What happened
            <lb />
            between July 10, 1961, and July 31, 1962,
            <lb />
            does not appear on the record. But the
            <lb />
            State changed its mind and adopted the
            <lb />
            recommendation of the
            <lb />
            Committee
            <lb />
            ignoring its earlier decision that the said
            <lb />
            recommendation was contrary to the
            <lb />
            larger interests of the State. In our
            <lb />
            opinion, when the State makes a special
            <lb />
            provision for the advancement of the
            <lb />
            weaker sections of society specified in
            <lb />
            Art. 15(4), it has to approach its task
            <lb />
            objectively and in a rational manner.
            <lb />
            Undoubtedly, it has to take reasonable
            <lb />
            and even generous steps to help the
            <lb />
            advancement of weaker elements; the
            <lb />
            extent of the problem must be weighted,
            <lb />
            the requirements of the community at
            <lb />
            large must be borne in mind and a formula
            <lb />
            must be evolved which would strike a
            <lb />
            reasonable balance between the several
            <lb />
            79
            <lb />
            relevant considerations. Therefore, we
            <lb />
            are satisfied that the reservation of 68%
            <lb />
            directed by the impugned order is plainly
            <lb />
            inconsistent with Art. 15(4).
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            35.
            <lb />
            The petitioners contend that having regard to
            <lb />
            the infirmities in the impugned order, action of
            <lb />
            the State in issuing the said order amounts to a
            <lb />
            fraud on the Constitutional power conferred on
            <lb />
            the State by Art. 15(4). This argument is well-
            <lb />
            founded, and must be upheld. When it is said
            <lb />
            about an executive action that it is a fraud on
            <lb />
            the Constitution, it does not necessarily mean
            <lb />
            that the action is actuated by malafides. An
            <lb />
            executive action which is patently and plainly
            <lb />
            outside the limits of the constitutional authority
            <lb />
            conferred on the State in that behalf is struck
            <lb />
            down as being ultra vires the State&apos;s authority.
            <lb />
            If, on the other hand, the executive action does
            <lb />
            not patently or overtly transgress the authority
            <lb />
            conferred on it by the Constitution, but the
            <lb />
            transgression is covert or latent, the said action
            <lb />
            is struck down as being a fraud on the relevant
            <lb />
            constitutional power. It is in this connection that
            <lb />
            courts often consider the substance of the
            <lb />
            matter and not its form and in ascertaining the
            <lb />
            substance of the matter, the appearance or the
            <lb />
            cloak, or the veil of the executive action is
            <lb />
            carefully scrutinized and if it appears that
            <lb />
            notwithstanding the appearance, the cloak or the
            <lb />
            veil of the executive action, in substance and in
            <lb />
            80
            <lb />
            truth the constitutional power has been
            <lb />
            transgressed, the impugned action is struck down
            <lb />
            as a fraud on the Constitution. We have already
            <lb />
            noticed that the impugned order in the present
            <lb />
            case has categorised the Backward Classes on
            <lb />
            the sole basis of caste which, in our opinion, is
            <lb />
            not permitted by Art. 15(4); and we have also
            <lb />
            held that the reservation of 68% made by the
            <lb />
            impugned order is plainly inconsistent with the
            <lb />
            concept of the special provision authorised by
            <lb />
            Art. 15(4). Therefore, it follows that the
            <lb />
            impugned order is a fraud on the Constitutional
            <lb />
            power conferred on the State by Art. 15(4).
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            37.
            <lb />
            Whilst we are dealing with this question,
            <lb />
            it would be relevant to add to that the
            <lb />
            provisions of Art. 15(4) are similar to
            <lb />
            those of Art. 16(4) which fell to be
            <lb />
            considered in the case of The General
            <lb />
            Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari
            <lb />
            (1970)IILLJ289SC In that case, the
            <lb />
            majority decision of this Court held that
            <lb />
            the power of reservation which is
            <lb />
            conferred
            <lb />
            on
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            State
            <lb />
            under
            <lb />
            Art. 16(4) can be exercised by the State
            <lb />
            in a proper case not only by providing for
            <lb />
            reservation of appointments, but also by
            <lb />
            providing for reservation of selection
            <lb />
            posts. This conclusion was reached on the
            <lb />
            basis that it served to give effect to the
            <lb />
            81
            <lb />
            intention of the Constitutional-makers to
            <lb />
            make adequate safeguards for the
            <lb />
            advancement of Backward Classes and to
            <lb />
            secure their adequate representation in
            <lb />
            the Services. The judgment shows that
            <lb />
            the only point which was raised for
            <lb />
            decision of this Court in that case was
            <lb />
            whether the reservation made was
            <lb />
            outside Art. 16(4) and that posed the
            <lb />
            bare question about the construction of
            <lb />
            Art. 16(4).
            <lb />
            The
            <lb />
            propriety,
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            reasonableness or the wisdom of the
            <lb />
            impugned order was not questioned
            <lb />
            because it was not the respondent&apos;s case
            <lb />
            that if the order was justified under
            <lb />
            Art. 16(4), it was a fraud on the
            <lb />
            Constitution. Even so, it was pointed out in
            <lb />
            the judgment that the efficiency of
            <lb />
            administration is of such a paramount
            <lb />
            importance that it would be unwise and
            <lb />
            impermissible to make any reservation at
            <lb />
            the cost of efficiency of administration;
            <lb />
            that, it was stated, was undoubtedly the
            <lb />
            effect of Art. 335. Therefore, what is
            <lb />
            true in regard to Art. 15(4) is equally true
            <lb />
            in regard to Art. 16(4). There can be no
            <lb />
            doubt that the Constitution-makers
            <lb />
            assumed, as they were entitled to, that
            <lb />
            while making adequate reservation under
            <lb />
            Art. 16(4), care would be taken not to
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            82
            <lb />
            provide for unreasonable, excessive or
            <lb />
            extravagant reservation, for that would,
            <lb />
            by eliminating general competition in a
            <lb />
            large field and by creating wide-spread
            <lb />
            dissatisfaction amongst the employees,
            <lb />
            materially affect efficiency. Therefore,
            <lb />
            like the special provision improperly made
            <lb />
            under Art. 15(4), reservation made under
            <lb />
            Art. 16(4) beyond the permissible and
            <lb />
            legitimate limits would be liable to be
            <lb />
            challenged as a fraud on the Constitution.
            <lb />
            In this connection it is necessary to
            <lb />
            emphasis that Art. 15(4) is an enabling
            <lb />
            provision; it does not impose an obligation,
            <lb />
            but merely leaves it to the discretion of
            <lb />
            the appropriate government to take
            <lb />
            suitable action, if necessary.&quot;
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            The Apex Court has not accepted caste to be the
            <lb />
            sole basis to determine classes of citizens. It is not only in
            <lb />
            Hindu religion but backwardness may exist in other religions,
            <lb />
            like, Muslims, Christians, Jains and even Lingayats. They
            <lb />
            cannot be provided benefit of reservation based on caste.
            <lb />
            The extent of reservation has also been discussed
            <lb />
            elaborately in paras 34 &amp; 35 of the judgment, referred
            <lb />
            above.
            <lb />
            A balance is required to be maintained between
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            83
            <lb />
            two sets of citizens while applying Article 15(4) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution. The reservation therein was provided to the
            <lb />
            extent of 68 percent in the educational institutions, which
            <lb />
            was not approved by the Apex Court. It was held to be
            <lb />
            excessive, affecting other citizens. The Court was reluctant
            <lb />
            to speak generally but, in a broad way, observed that
            <lb />
            reservation should be less than 50 per cent. How much less
            <lb />
            than 50 per cent would depend upon prevailing circumstances
            <lb />
            of each State. The reservation to the extent of 68 per cent
            <lb />
            was taken to be in violation of the constitutional powers
            <lb />
            conferred on the State under Article 15(4) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution. The Notification was struck down finding it to
            <lb />
            be a fraud on the constitutional powers.
            <lb />
            In para 35, the Court observed about reservation
            <lb />
            based on caste and to the extent of 68 per cent in few lines,
            <lb />
            which are; w e have already noticed that the impugned order in the
            <lb />
            present case has categorised the Backward Classes on the sole basis of
            <lb />
            caste which, in our opinion, is not permitted by Article 15(4) and we have
            <lb />
            also held that the reservation of 68% made by the impugned order is
            <lb />
            plainly inconsistent with the concept of the special provision authorised
            <lb />
            by Article 15(4). Therefore, it follows that the impugned order is a
            <lb />
            fraud on the Constitutional power conferred on the State by Article
            <lb />
            The Apex Court has considered the issue of
            <lb />
            extent of reservation from time to time. The judgment in the
            <lb />
            case of Indra Sawhney (supra) has been referred by learned
            <lb />
            Solicitor General of India to show that reservation beyond 50
            <lb />
            per cent to be permissible.
            <lb />
            To appreciate the argument, we may now refer
            <lb />
            the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Indra
            <lb />
            Sawhney (supra). The question No.6 was framed to decide
            <lb />
            extent of reservation. The discussion on the issue has been
            <lb />
            made in paras 804 to 810 and they are quoted thus :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            &quot;804. In Balaji, a Constitution Bench of this
            <lb />
            Court rejected the argument that in the
            <lb />
            absence of a limitation contained in Article
            <lb />
            15(4), no limitation can be prescribed by the
            <lb />
            court on the extent of reservation. It
            <lb />
            observed that a provision under Article 15(4)
            <lb />
            being a &quot;special provision&quot; must be within
            <lb />
            reasonable limits. It may be appropriate to
            <lb />
            quote the relevant holding from the judgment:
            <lb />
            When Article 15(4) refers to the special
            <lb />
            provision for the advancement of certain
            <lb />
            classes
            <lb />
            or
            <lb />
            Scheduled
            <lb />
            Castes
            <lb />
            or
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes, it must not be ignored
            <lb />
            85
            <lb />
            that the provision which is authorised to
            <lb />
            be made is a special provision; it is not a
            <lb />
            provision which is
            <lb />
            exhaustive in
            <lb />
            character, so that in looking after the
            <lb />
            advancement of those classes, the State
            <lb />
            would be justified in ignoring altogether
            <lb />
            the advancement of the rest of the
            <lb />
            society. It is because the interests of
            <lb />
            the society at large would be served by
            <lb />
            promoting the advancement of the
            <lb />
            weaker elements in the society that
            <lb />
            Article 15(4) authorises special provision
            <lb />
            to be made. But if a provision which is in
            <lb />
            the nature of an exception completely
            <lb />
            excludes the rest of the society, that
            <lb />
            clearly is outside the scope of
            <lb />
            Article 15(4). It would be extremely
            <lb />
            unreasonable to assume that in enacting
            <lb />
            Article 15(4) the Parliament intended to
            <lb />
            provide that where the advancement of
            <lb />
            the Backward Classes or the Scheduled
            <lb />
            Castes and Tribes was concerned, the
            <lb />
            fundamental rights of the citizens
            <lb />
            constituting the rest of the society were
            <lb />
            to be completely and absolutely
            <lb />
            ignored....A
            <lb />
            Special
            <lb />
            provision
            <lb />
            contemplated
            <lb />
            by
            <lb />
            Article 15(4) like
            <lb />
            reservation for posts and appointments
            <lb />
            86
            <lb />
            contemplated by Article 16(4) must be
            <lb />
            within reasonable limits. The interests of
            <lb />
            weaker sections of society which are a
            <lb />
            first charge on the State and the center
            <lb />
            have to be adjusted with the interests
            <lb />
            of the community as a whole. The
            <lb />
            adjustment of these competing claims is
            <lb />
            undoubtedly a difficult matter, but if
            <lb />
            under the guise of making a special
            <lb />
            provision, a State reserves practically all
            <lb />
            the seats available in all the colleges,
            <lb />
            that clearly would be adverting the
            <lb />
            object of Article 15(4). In this matter
            <lb />
            again, we are reluctant to say definitely
            <lb />
            what would be a proper provision to
            <lb />
            make. Speaking generally and in a broad
            <lb />
            way a special provision should be less
            <lb />
            than 50%; how much less than 50% would
            <lb />
            depend upon the relevant prevailing
            <lb />
            circumstances in each case.
            <lb />
            In Devadasan this rule of 50% was applied to a
            <lb />
            case arising under Article 16(4) and on that
            <lb />
            basis the carry-forward rule was struck down.
            <lb />
            In Thomas, however the correctness of this
            <lb />
            principle was questioned. Fazal Ali, J.
            <lb />
            observed:
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            87
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            This means that the reservation should
            <lb />
            be within the permissible limits and
            <lb />
            should not be a cloak to fill all the posts
            <lb />
            belonging to a particular class of citizens
            <lb />
            and thus violate Article 16(1) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution indirectly. At the same time
            <lb />
            Clause (4) of Article 16 does not fix any
            <lb />
            limit on the power of the government to
            <lb />
            make reservation. Since Clause (4) is a
            <lb />
            part of Article 16 of the Constitution it
            <lb />
            is manifest that the State cannot be
            <lb />
            allowed
            <lb />
            to
            <lb />
            indulge
            <lb />
            in
            <lb />
            excessive
            <lb />
            reservation so as to defeat the policy
            <lb />
            contained in Article 16(1). As to what
            <lb />
            would be a suitable reservation within
            <lb />
            permissible limits will depend upon the
            <lb />
            facts and circumstances of each case
            <lb />
            and no hard and fast rule can be laid
            <lb />
            down, nor can this matter be reduced to
            <lb />
            a mathematical formula so as to be
            <lb />
            adhered to in all cases. Decided cases of
            <lb />
            this Court have no doubt laid down that
            <lb />
            the percentage of reservation should not
            <lb />
            exceed 50%. As I read the authorities,
            <lb />
            this is however, a rule of caution and
            <lb />
            does not exhaust all categories. Suppose
            <lb />
            for instance a State has a large number
            <lb />
            of backward class of citizens which
            <lb />
            88
            <lb />
            constitute 80% of the population and the
            <lb />
            Government, in order to give them proper
            <lb />
            representation, reserves 80% of the
            <lb />
            jobs for them can it be said that the
            <lb />
            percentage of reservation is bad and
            <lb />
            violates the permissible limits of Clause
            <lb />
            (4) of Article 16? The answer must
            <lb />
            necessarily be in the negative. The
            <lb />
            dominant object to this provision is to
            <lb />
            take
            <lb />
            steps
            <lb />
            to
            <lb />
            make
            <lb />
            inadequate
            <lb />
            representation adequate.
            <lb />
            Krishna Iyer, J. agreed with the view taken by
            <lb />
            Fazal Ali, J. in the following words:
            <lb />
            I agree with my learned brother Fazal
            <lb />
            Ali, J. in the view that the arithmatical
            <lb />
            limit of 50% in any one year set by some
            <lb />
            earlier rulings cannot perhaps be
            <lb />
            pressed too far. Overall representation
            <lb />
            in a department does not depend on
            <lb />
            recruitment in a particular year, but the
            <lb />
            total strength of a cadre. I agree with
            <lb />
            his construction of Article 16(4) and his
            <lb />
            view about the carry forward&apos; rule.
            <lb />
            Mathew, J. did not specifically deal with
            <lb />
            this aspect but from the principles of
            <lb />
            &apos;proportional equality&apos; and &apos;equality of
            <lb />
            results&apos; espoused by the learned Judge, it
            <lb />
            89
            <lb />
            is argued that he did not accept the 50%
            <lb />
            rule. Beg, J. also did not refer to this rule
            <lb />
            but the following sentence occurs in his
            <lb />
            judgment at pages 962 and 963:
            <lb />
            If a reservation of posts under
            <lb />
            Article 16(4) for employees of backward
            <lb />
            classes
            <lb />
            could
            <lb />
            include
            <lb />
            complete
            <lb />
            reservation of higher posts to which
            <lb />
            they could be promoted, about which
            <lb />
            there could be no doubt now, I fail to
            <lb />
            see why it cannot be partial or for a
            <lb />
            part of the duration of service and
            <lb />
            hedged round with the condition that a
            <lb />
            temporary promotion would operate as a
            <lb />
            complete and confirmed promotion only
            <lb />
            if the temporary promotee satisfies
            <lb />
            some tests within a given time.
            <lb />
            Ray, C.J., did not dispute the
            <lb />
            correctness of the 50% rule but at the
            <lb />
            same time he pointed out that this
            <lb />
            percentage should be applied to the
            <lb />
            entire service as a whole.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            805. After the decision in Thomas,
            <lb />
            controversy arose whether the 50% rule
            <lb />
            enunciated in Balaji stands overruled by
            <lb />
            Thomas or does it continue to be valid. In
            <lb />
            90
            <lb />
            Vasant Kumar, two learned judges came to
            <lb />
            precisely opposite conclusions on this question.
            <lb />
            Chinnappa Reddy, J. held that Thomas has the
            <lb />
            effect of undoing the 50% rule in Balaji
            <lb />
            whereas Venkataramiah, J. held that it does
            <lb />
            not.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            806. It is argued before us that the
            <lb />
            observations on the said question in Thomas
            <lb />
            were obiter and do not constitute a decision so
            <lb />
            as to have the effect of overruling Balaji.
            <lb />
            Reliance is also placed upon the speech of Dr.
            <lb />
            Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly, where
            <lb />
            he said that reservation must be confined to a
            <lb />
            minority of seats (See para 28). It is also
            <lb />
            pointed out that Krishna Iyer, J. who agreed
            <lb />
            with Fazal Ali, J. in Thomas on this aspect,
            <lb />
            came back to, and affirmed, the 50% rule in
            <lb />
            Karamchari Sangh (at pp. 241 and 242). On the
            <lb />
            other hand, it is argued for the respondents
            <lb />
            that when the population of the other
            <lb />
            backward classes is more than 50% of the
            <lb />
            total population, the reservation in their
            <lb />
            favour (excluding Scheduled Castes and
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes) can also be 50%.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            807. We must, however, point out that Clause
            <lb />
            (4) speaks of adequate representation and not
            <lb />
            proportionate
            <lb />
            representation.
            <lb />
            Adequate
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            91
            <lb />
            representation
            <lb />
            cannot
            <lb />
            be
            <lb />
            read
            <lb />
            as
            <lb />
            proportionate representation. Principle of
            <lb />
            proportionate representation is accepted only
            <lb />
            in Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution
            <lb />
            and that too for a limited period. These
            <lb />
            articles speak of reservation of seats in Lok
            <lb />
            Sabha and the State Legislatures in favour of
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes
            <lb />
            proportionate to their population, but they are
            <lb />
            only temporary and special provisions. It is
            <lb />
            therefore not possible to accept the theory
            <lb />
            of proportionate representation though the
            <lb />
            proportion of population of backward classes
            <lb />
            to the total population would certainly be
            <lb />
            relevant. Just as every power must be
            <lb />
            exercised reasonably and fairly, the power
            <lb />
            conferred by Clause (4) of Article 16 should
            <lb />
            also be exercised in a fair manner and within
            <lb />
            reasonably limits -and what is more
            <lb />
            reasonable than to say that reservation under
            <lb />
            Clause (4) shall not exceed 50% of the
            <lb />
            appointments or posts, barring certain extra-
            <lb />
            ordinary situations as explained hereinafter.
            <lb />
            From this point of view, the 27% reservation
            <lb />
            provided by the impugned Memorandums in
            <lb />
            favour of backward classes is well within the
            <lb />
            reasonable limits. Together with reservation in
            <lb />
            favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
            <lb />
            92
            <lb />
            Tribes, it comes to a total of 49.5%. In this
            <lb />
            connection, reference may be had to the Full
            <lb />
            Bench decision of the Andhra Pradesh High
            <lb />
            Court in Narayan Rao v. State 1987 A.P. 53,
            <lb />
            striking down the enhancement of reservation
            <lb />
            from 25% to 44% for O.B.Cs. The said
            <lb />
            enhancement had the effect of taking the
            <lb />
            total reservation under Article16(4) to 65%.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            808. It needs no emphasis to say that the
            <lb />
            principle aim of Article 14 and 16 is equality
            <lb />
            and equality of opportunity and that Clause (4)
            <lb />
            of Article 16 is but a means of achieving the
            <lb />
            very same objective. Clause (4) is a special
            <lb />
            provision -though not an exception to Clause
            <lb />
            (1). Both the provisions have to be harmonised
            <lb />
            keeping in mind the fact that both are but the
            <lb />
            restatements of the principle of equality
            <lb />
            enshrined in Article 14. The provision under
            <lb />
            Article 16(4) -conceived in the interest of
            <lb />
            certain sections of society -should be
            <lb />
            balanced against the guarantee of equality
            <lb />
            enshrined in Clause (1) of Article 16 which is a
            <lb />
            guarantee held out to every citizen and to the
            <lb />
            entire society. It is relevant to point out that
            <lb />
            Dr.
            <lb />
            Ambedkar
            <lb />
            himself
            <lb />
            contemplated
            <lb />
            reservation being &quot;confined to a minority of
            <lb />
            seats&quot; (See his speech in Constituent
            <lb />
            Assembly, set out in para 28). No other
            <lb />

            <lb />
            member of the Constituent Assembly
            <lb />
            suggested otherwise. It is, thus clear that
            <lb />
            reservation of a majority of seats was never
            <lb />
            envisaged by the founding fathers. Nor are we
            <lb />
            satisfied that the present context requires us
            <lb />
            to depart from that concept.

            809. From the above discussion, the
            <lb />
            irresistible conclusion that follows is that the
            <lb />
            reservations contemplated in Clause (4) of
            <lb />
            Article 16 should not exceed 50%.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            810. While 50% shall be the rule, it is
            <lb />
            necessary not to put out of consideration
            <lb />
            certain extraordinary situations inherent in
            <lb />
            the great diversity of this country and the
            <lb />
            people. It might happen that in far-flung and
            <lb />
            remote areas the population inhabiting those
            <lb />
            areas might, on account of their being out of
            <lb />
            the main stream of national life and in view of
            <lb />
            conditions peculiar to and characteristical to
            <lb />
            them, need to be treated in a different way,
            <lb />
            some relaxation in this strict rule may become
            <lb />
            imperative. In doing so, extreme caution is to
            <lb />
            be exercised and a special case made out.&quot;
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            Para 809, quoted above, shows irresistible
            <lb />
            conclusion that reservations contemplated in Clause (4) of
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />

            94
            <lb />
            Article 16 should not exceed 50 per cent. In para 810 of the
            <lb />
            said judgment, ceiling of 50 per cent reservation was taken as
            <lb />
            a rule, however, exception was carved out in extra ordinary
            <lb />
            situations inherent in the great diversity of the country and
            <lb />
            the people. The relaxation in strict rule of 50 per cent is to
            <lb />
            be applied with extreme caution and if special case is made
            <lb />
            out. The Apex Court therein considered the judgment of
            <lb />
            Constitutional Bench in the case of M.R.Balaji &amp; Ors. (supra)
            <lb />

            <lb />
            conclude ceiling of 50 per cent as a rule with exception in

            being out of the main-stream of national
            <lb />
            life and in view of the conditions peculiar to
            <lb />
            and characteristic of them need to be
            <lb />
            treated in a different way, some relaxation
            <lb />
            in this strict rule may become imperative.
            <lb />
            In doing so, extreme caution is to be
            <lb />
            exercised and a special case made out.
            <lb />
            For applying this rule, the reservations should
            <lb />
            not exceed 50% of the appointments in a
            <lb />
            grade, cadre or service in any given year.
            <lb />
            Reservation can be made in a service or
            <lb />
            category only when the State is satisfied that
            <lb />
            representation of backward class of citizens
            <lb />
            therein is not adequate.
            <lb />
            To the extent, Devadasan is inconsistent
            <lb />
            herewith, it is over-ruled.&quot;
            <lb />
            In the light of the judgment of the Constitutional
            <lb />
            Bench of the Apex Court in the case of Indra Sawhney
            <lb />
            96
            <lb />
            (supra), it can conveniently be concluded that ceiling of 50
            <lb />
            per cent on reservation is to be taken as a rule but, in extra
            <lb />
            ordinary situation, it would be permissible to exceed the
            <lb />
            ceiling. While applying the relaxation to the general rule of
            <lb />
            50 per cent, an extreme caution has to be taken. It is only
            <lb />
            when special case is made out or there exists extra ordinary
            <lb />
            situation.
            <lb />
            The Apex Court in the said judgment further
            <lb />
            emphasised requirement of permanent body for entertaining,
            <lb />
            examining, recommending for inclusion and exclusion of caste
            <lb />
            in the list of other backward classes of citizens. The
            <lb />
            permanent body was to be constituted within the period of
            <lb />
            four months. The exclusion was also emphasised.
            <lb />
            The Apex Court in the case of Indra Sawhney
            <lb />
            (supra) further considered the judgment in the case of

        <p>
            T.Devadason Vs. Union of India &amp; Anr. reported in AIR
            <lb />
            1964 SC 179. The issue therein was in regard to carry
            <lb />
            forward of vacancies in case it remained unfilled from
            <lb />
            reserve category. It was held that ceiling of 50 per cent
            <lb />
            should be applied as a rule and it would be even to carry
            <lb />
            forward vacancies. The conclusion thereby was that even if
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            97
            <lb />
            there are carry forward of vacancies, ceiling of 50 per cent
            <lb />
            would be applied. When the vacancies are advertised, it may
            <lb />
            include even backlog of vacancies, yet ceiling of 50 per cent
            <lb />
            would be applicable thus no exception to ceiling was allowed
            <lb />
            even for the backlog vacancies. The Apex Court has given an
            <lb />
            illustration for it in para 817 of its judgment and conclusions
            <lb />
            have been drawn in para 818. Both the paras are relevant thus
            <lb />
            quoted hereunder for ready reference because subsequently
            <lb />
            81 st amendment in the Constitution of India was made in the
            <lb />
            light of the observations made therein :-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            &quot;817. We are of the respectful opinion that on
            <lb />
            its own reasoning, the decision in so far as it
            <lb />
            strikes down the Rule is not sustainable. The
            <lb />
            most that could have been done in that case
            <lb />
            was to quash the appointments in excess of
            <lb />
            50%, inasmuch as, as a matter of fact, more
            <lb />
            than 50% of the vacancies for the year 1960
            <lb />
            came to be reserved by virtue of the said Rule.
            <lb />
            But it would not be correct to presume that
            <lb />
            that is the necessary and the only consequence
            <lb />
            of that rule. Let us take the very illustration
            <lb />
            given at pp. 691-2, -namely 100 vacancies
            <lb />
            arising in three successive years and 18% being
            <lb />
            the reservation quota -and examine. Take a
            <lb />
            case, where in the first year, out of 18
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            98
            <lb />
            reserved vacancies 9 are filled up and 9 are
            <lb />
            carried forward. Similarly, in the second year
            <lb />
            again, 9 are filled up and another 9 are carried
            <lb />
            forward. Result would be that in the third
            <lb />
            year, 9 + 9 + 18 = 36 (out of a total of 100)
            <lb />
            would be reserved which would be far less than
            <lb />
            50%; the rule in Balaji is not violated. But by
            <lb />
            striking down the Rule itself, carrying forward
            <lb />
            of vacancies even in such a situation has
            <lb />
            become impermissible, which appears to us
            <lb />
            indefensible in principle. We may also point out
            <lb />
            that the premise made in Balaji and reiterated
            <lb />
            in Devadasan, to the effect that Clause (4) is
            <lb />
            an exception to Clause (1) is no longer
            <lb />
            acceptable, having been given up in Thomas. It
            <lb />
            is for this reason that in Karamchari Sangh,
            <lb />
            Krishna Iyer, J. explained Devadasan in the
            <lb />
            following words:
            <lb />
            In Devadasan&apos;s case the court went into
            <lb />
            the actuals, not into the hypotheticals.
            <lb />
            This is most important. The Court
            <lb />
            actually
            <lb />
            verified
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            degree
            <lb />

            <lb />
            right....
            <lb />
            .... What is striking is that the Court did
            <lb />
            not take an academic view or make a
            <lb />
            notional evaluation but checked up to

            the selection of appointments of SC&amp;ST
            <lb />
            candidates considerably in excess of
            <lb />
            50% we uphold Annexure I.
            <lb />
            We are in respectful agreement with the
            <lb />
            above statement of law. Accordingly, we
            <lb />
            over-rule the decision in Devadasan. We
            <lb />
            have already discussed and explained the
            <lb />
            50% rule in paras 93 to 96. The same
            <lb />
            position would apply in the case of carry
            <lb />
            forward rule as well. We, however, agree
            <lb />
            that an year should be taken as the unit or
            <lb />
            100
            <lb />
            basis, as the case may be, for applying the
            <lb />
            rule of 50% and not the entire cadre
            <lb />
            strength.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            818. We may reiterate that a carry forward
            <lb />
            rule need not necessarily be in the same terms
            <lb />
            as the one found in Devadasan. A given rule
            <lb />
            may say that the unfilled reserved vacancies
            <lb />
            shall not be filled by unreserved category
            <lb />
            candidates but shall be carried forward as
            <lb />
            such for a period of three years. In such a
            <lb />
            case, a contention may be raised that reserved
            <lb />
            posts remain a separate category altogether.
            <lb />
            In our opinion, however, the result of
            <lb />
            application of carry forward rule, in whatever
            <lb />
            manner it is operated, should not result in
            <lb />
            breach of 50% rule.
            <lb />
            81 st amendment in the Constitution was brought on
            <lb />
            09 th June, 2000 and is relevant and to be seen in seriatim of
            <lb />
            the events.
            <lb />
            The reference of objects and reasons in bringing
            <lb />
            81 st amendment in the Constitution has been given by learned
            <lb />
            counsel Dr. Manish Singhvi. It is to nullify the effect of the
            <lb />
            judgment putting ceiling of 50 per cent on backlog vacancies.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            101
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            The plain reading of Clause (4B) of Article 16 of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India, however, reveals that reference of
            <lb />
            ceiling of 50 per cent has been given and is to be applied on
            <lb />
            the vacancies of the year in which they are to be filled.
            <lb />
            The issue of reservation based on caste has been
            <lb />
            elaborately discussed by the Apex Court in the case of
            <lb />
            Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra), Indra Sawhney (supra) and
            <lb />
            M.R.Balaji (supra). It is with a direction of exclusion of caste
            <lb />
            from Backward Class otherwise to be considered failure of
            <lb />
            the system. The issue of period was also discussed. Para 666
            <lb />
            in the case of Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra) is quoted
            <lb />
            hereunder to sum up the issue :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            &quot;666. Caste has divided this country for
            <lb />
            ages. It has hampered its growth. To have a
            <lb />
            casteless society will be realization of a
            <lb />
            noble dream. To start with, the effect of
            <lb />
            reservation may appear to perpetuate caste.
            <lb />
            The immediate effect of caste based
            <lb />
            reservation has been rather unfortunate. In
            <lb />
            the pre-reservation era people wanted to
            <lb />
            get rid of the backward tag --either social
            <lb />
            or economical. But post reservation, there is
            <lb />
            a tendency even among those who are
            <lb />
            considered as &apos;forward&apos;, to seek &apos;backward&apos;
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            102
            <lb />
            tag, in the hope of enjoying the benefits of
            <lb />
            reservations. When more and more people
            <lb />
            aspire for &apos;backwardness&apos; instead of
            <lb />
            &apos;forwardness&apos; the country itself stagnates.
            <lb />
            Be that as it may. Reservation as an
            <lb />
            affirmative action is required only for a
            <lb />
            limited period to bring forward the socially
            <lb />
            and educationally backward classes by giving
            <lb />
            them a gentle supportive push. But if there
            <lb />
            is no review after a reasonable period and if
            <lb />
            reservation is continued, the country will
            <lb />
            become a caste divided society permanently.
            <lb />
            Instead of developing an united society with
            <lb />
            diversity, we will end up as a fractured
            <lb />
            society for ever suspicious of each other.
            <lb />
            While affirmative discrimination is a road to
            <lb />
            equality, care should be taken that the road
            <lb />
            does not become a rut in which the vehicle
            <lb />
            of progress gets entrenched and stuck. Any
            <lb />
            provision for reservation is a temporary
            <lb />
            crutch. Such crutch by unnecessary
            <lb />
            prolonged use, should not become a
            <lb />
            permanent liability. It is significant that
            <lb />
            Constitution does not specifically prescribe a
            <lb />
            casteless society nor tries to abolish caste.
            <lb />
            But by barring discrimination in the name of
            <lb />
            caste and by providing for affirmative caste.
            <lb />
            When the differences in status among
            <lb />
            103
            <lb />
            castes are removed, all castes will become
            <lb />
            equal. That will be a beginning for a
            <lb />
            casteless egalitarian society.&quot;
            <lb />
            In view of the judgment of the Apex Court,
            <lb />
            referred to above, ceiling of 50 per cent is to be taken as a
            <lb />
            rule and exception can be in the extra ordinary situation when
            <lb />
            a special case is made out. It is also that reservation should
            <lb />
            not be made solely based on caste. The answer of the first
            <lb />
            question is given accordingly. The finding aforesaid is not to
            <lb />
            affect next issue in reference to Article 16(4B) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (ii) whether Clause (4B) of Article
            <lb />
            16 of the Constitution of India
            <lb />
            can
            <lb />
            be
            <lb />
            construed
            <lb />
            to
            <lb />
            be
            <lb />
            constitutional
            <lb />
            amendment
            <lb />
            to
            <lb />
            provide ceiling of 50 per cent on
            <lb />
            the vacancy of a year?
            <lb />
            To make a proper interpretation of Clause (4B) of
            <lb />
            Article 16 of the Constitution, it has to be divided in two
            <lb />
            parts.
            <lb />
            The first part is for backlog vacancies not to be
            <lb />
            included in total vacancies of the year for ceiling of 50 per
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            104
            <lb />
            cent.
            <lb />
            The second part makes a reference of vacancy of
            <lb />
            the year in which it is to be filled for determination of ceiling
            <lb />
            of 50 per cent reservation.
            <lb />
            The ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation would
            <lb />
            accordingly be applicable on the vacancy of the year only in
            <lb />
            which it is to be filled and not on the backlog vacancies. The
            <lb />
            amendment does not relax ceiling of 50 per cent on the
            <lb />
            vacancies of the year, in which, it is to be filled. Clause (4B)
            <lb />
            of Article 16 of the Constitution of India has to be read
            <lb />
            without inclusion or exclusion of words used therein.
            <lb />
            It is, however, argued on behalf of the State that
            <lb />
            even if Article 16(4B) of the Constitution of India imposes
            <lb />
            ceiling of 50 per cent, it is only for the vacancies which are
            <lb />
            to be filled in that year. The provision can be enforced even
            <lb />
            with 54 per cent reservation. While restricting the
            <lb />
            reservation to the extent of 50 per cent on the vacancy of a
            <lb />
            year, excess to be carried forward in the next year. By
            <lb />
            undertaking the said exercise, Article 16(4B) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India would not be violated.
            <lb />
            We have given due consideration to the arguments
            <lb />
            105
            <lb />
            aforesaid. In this regard, the meaning of &quot;unfilled or backlog
            <lb />
            vacancies&quot; needs to be considered. The &quot;backlog vacancies&quot;,
            <lb />
            referred as &quot;unfilled vacancies&quot; are those which are reserved
            <lb />
            for being filled in the year in accordance with Clause (4) or
            <lb />
            Clause (4A) of Article 16 of the Constitution but remains
            <lb />
            unfilled. It is to be taken as separate class of vacancies. It
            <lb />
            may be due to non-availability of adequate number of reserve
            <lb />
            category candidates or their failure to obtain required marks
            <lb />
            in the selection, if provided.
            <lb />
            If it is assumed that 4 per cent vacancies are to
            <lb />
            be considered as unfilled or backlog vacancies every year
            <lb />
            then with carry forward of those vacancies every year, it
            <lb />
            would accumulate and become more than 100 per cent after
            <lb />
            few years leaving no vacancy for general category.
            <lb />
            The interpretation of Article 16(4B) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India, given above, needs further
            <lb />
            consideration in the light of the judgments of the Apex Court
            <lb />
            and this Court subsequent to the constitutional amendment.
            <lb />
            The judgment in the case of M.Nagaraj &amp; Ors.
            <lb />
            (supra) has been referred by learned counsel for respective
            <lb />
            parties. The Apex Court has considered various issues in
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS

            reference to Article 16(4), (4A) and (4B) of the Constitution
            <lb />
            of India apart from Articles 14, 15, 335, 368 and the
            <lb />
            Preamble of the Constitution of India. It was in the matter of
            <lb />
            promotion but general principles have been laid down by the
            <lb />
            Constitutional Bench of the Apex Court in the case supra
            <lb />
            after amendment in Article 16 of the Constitution of India.
            <lb />
            The reference of paras 55 to 57, 85, 88, 89, 95,
            <lb />
            112, 116, 117, 119, 121 and 123 have been given by the
            <lb />
            respondents, whereas, learned counsel for the petitioners
            <lb />
            have given reference of paras 46, 51, 100, 102 of the said
            <lb />
            judgment, however, this Court would refer the relevant paras
            <lb />
            of the said judgment for proper evolution of the issue.
            <lb />
            In para 49 of the said judgment, the Apex Court
            <lb />
            held that reservation is necessary for transcending caste and
            <lb />
            not for perpetuating it. The reservation has to be used in a
            <lb />
            limited sense otherwise it will perpetuate casteism in the
            <lb />
            country. The observation regarding perpetuation of casteism
            <lb />
            is of relevance and to be taken into consideration in
            <lb />
            reference to passage of time, after independence. The State
            <lb />
            as well as the Central Government are required to consider as
            <lb />
            to whether continuance of reservation based on caste would
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS

            107
            <lb />
            be in the interest of the country or it would perpetuate the
            <lb />
            casteism. It may divide the country based on caste and would
            <lb />
            be opposed to the idea of framers of the Constitution to
            <lb />
            keep the nation one with equality between the citizens.
            <lb />
            In para 53 of the said judgment, the issue of
            <lb />
            extent of reservation has been framed and, thereupon,
            <lb />
            discussion was made in subsequent paras. Para Nos.53 to 59,
            <lb />
            82, 83, 85, 88, 89 and 95 of the judgment in the case of

            <lb />
            involves two questions:
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            1. Whether there is any upper limit
            <lb />
            beyond which reservation is not
            <lb />
            permissible?
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            2. Whether there is any limit to which
            <lb />
            seats can be reserved in a particular
            <lb />
            year; in other words the issue is
            <lb />
            whether the percentage limit applies
            <lb />
            only on the total number of posts in the
            <lb />
            cadre or to the percentage of posts
            <lb />
            advertised every year as well?
            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            54.The question of extent of reservation is
            <lb />
            closely linked to the issue whether Article
            <lb />
            16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1) or is
            <lb />
            Article 16(4) an application of Article 16(1). If
            <lb />
            Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1)
            <lb />
            then it needs to be given a limited application
            <lb />
            so as not to eclipse the general rule in
            <lb />
            Article16(1). But if Article 16(4) is taken as an
            <lb />
            application of Article 16(1) then the two
            <lb />
            articles have to be harmonized keeping in view
            <lb />
            the interests of certain sections of the
            <lb />
            society as against the interest of the
            <lb />
            individual citizens of the society.

        <p>
            55. Word of caution against excess
            <lb />
            reservation was first pointed out in The
            <lb />
            General Manager, Southern Railway and
            <lb />
            Anr. v. Rangachari Gajendragadkar, J. giving
            <lb />
            the majority judgment said that reservation
            <lb />
            under Article 16(4)is intended merely to give
            <lb />
            adequate
            <lb />
            representation
            <lb />
            to
            <lb />
            backward
            <lb />
            communities. It cannot be used for creating
            <lb />
            monopolies or for unduly or illegitimately
            <lb />
            disturbing the legitimate interests of other
            <lb />
            employees. A reasonable balance must be
            <lb />
            struck between the claims of backward classes
            <lb />

            109
            <lb />
            and claims of other employees as well as the
            <lb />
            requirement of efficiency of administration.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            56. However, the question of extent of
            <lb />
            reservation was not directly involved in
            <lb />
            Rangachari. It was directly involved in M.R.
            <lb />
            Balaji and Ors. v. The State of Mysore
            <lb />
            and Ors. with reference to Article 15(4). In
            <lb />
            this case, 60% reservations under Article
            <lb />
            15(4) was struck down as excessive and
            <lb />
            unconstitutional.
            <lb />
            Gajendragadkar,
            <lb />
            J.
            <lb />
            observed that special provision should be
            <lb />
            less than 50 per cent, how much less would
            <lb />
            depend
            <lb />
            on
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            relevant
            <lb />
            prevailing
            <lb />
            circumstances of each case.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            57. But in State of Kerala and Anr. v. N.M.
            <lb />
            Thomas and Ors. (1976)ILLJ376SC Krishna
            <lb />
            Iyer, J. expressed his concurrence to the
            <lb />
            views of Fazal Ali, J. who said that although
            <lb />
            reservation cannot be so excessive as to
            <lb />
            destroy the principle of equality of
            <lb />
            opportunity under Clause (1) of Article 16, yet
            <lb />
            it should be noted that the Constitution itself
            <lb />
            does not put any bar on the power of the
            <lb />
            Government under Article 16(4). If a State
            <lb />
            has 80% population which is backward then it
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            110
            <lb />
            would be meaningless to say that reservation
            <lb />
            should not cross 50%.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            58.
            <lb />
            However, in Indra Sawhney the majority
            <lb />
            held that the rule of 50% laid down in
            <lb />
            Balaji was a binding rule and not a mere
            <lb />
            rule of prudence.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            59. Giving the judgment of the Court in Indra
            <lb />
            Sawhney, Reddy, J. stated that Article 16(4)
            <lb />
            speaks of adequate representation not
            <lb />
            proportionate
            <lb />
            representation
            <lb />
            although
            <lb />
            proportion of population of backward classes
            <lb />
            to the total population would certainly be
            <lb />
            relevant. He further pointed out that Article
            <lb />
            16(4) which protects interests of certain
            <lb />
            sections of society has to be balanced against
            <lb />
            Article 16(1) which protects the interests of
            <lb />
            every citizen of the entire society. They
            <lb />
            should be harmonised because they are
            <lb />
            restatements of principle of equality under
            <lb />
            Article14. (emphasis added).
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            82. Before dealing with the scope of the
            <lb />
            constitutional amendments we need to recap
            <lb />
            the judgments in Indra Sawhney and R.K.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            Sabharwal . In the former case the majority
            <lb />
            held that 50% rule should be applied to each
            <lb />
            year otherwise it may happen that the open
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            111
            <lb />
            competition channel may get choked if the
            <lb />
            entire cadre strength is taken as a unit.
            <lb />
            However in R.K. Sabharwal, this Court stated
            <lb />
            that the entire cadre strength should be
            <lb />
            taken into account to determine whether the
            <lb />
            reservation up to the quota-limit has been
            <lb />
            reached. It was clarified that the judgment in
            <lb />
            Indra Sawhney was confined to initial
            <lb />
            appointments and not to promotions. The
            <lb />
            operation of the roster for filling the cadre
            <lb />
            strength, by itself, ensure that the
            <lb />
            reservation remains within the ceiling-limit of
            <lb />
            50%.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            83. In our view, appropriate Government has
            <lb />
            to apply the cadre strength as a unit in the
            <lb />
            operation of the roster in order to ascertain
            <lb />
            whether a given class/group is adequately
            <lb />
            represented in the service. The cadre
            <lb />
            strength as a unit also ensures that upper
            <lb />
            ceiling-limit of 50% is not violated. Further,
            <lb />
            roster has to be post-specific and not
            <lb />
            vacancy based.
            <lb />
        </p>

            85. The Supreme Court in its judgment dated
            <lb />
            16.11.92 in Indra Sawhney stated that
            <lb />
            reservation of appointments or posts under
            <lb />
            Article 16(4) is confined to initial appointment
            <lb />

            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            112
            <lb />
            and cannot extend to reservation in the
            <lb />
            matter of promotion. Prior to the judgment in
            <lb />
            Indra Sawhney reservation in promotion
            <lb />
            existed. The Government felt that the
            <lb />
            judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney
            <lb />
            adversely affected the interests of SCs and
            <lb />
            STs in services, as they have not reached the
            <lb />
            required level. Therefore, the Government
            <lb />
            felt that it was necessary to continue the
            <lb />
            existing policy of providing reservation in
            <lb />
            promotion confined to SCs and STs alone. We

            REASONS.-The Scheduled Castes and the
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes have been enjoying the
            <lb />
            facility of reservation in promotion since
            <lb />
            1955. The Supreme Court in its judgment
            <lb />
            dated 16th November, 1992 in the case of
            <lb />
            Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, however,
            <lb />
            observed that reservation of appointments
            <lb />
            or posts under Article 16(4) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution
            <lb />
            is

            to

            to
            <lb />
            reservation in the matter of promotion.
            <lb />
            This ruling of the Supreme Court will
            <lb />
            adversely affect the interests of the
            <lb />
            Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
            <lb />
            Tribes. Since the representation of the
            <lb />
            Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
            <lb />
            in services in the States have not reached
            <lb />
            the required level, it is necessary to
            <lb />
            continue the existing dispensation of
            <lb />
            providing reservation in promotion in the
            <lb />
            case of the Scheduled Castes and the
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes. In view of the
            <lb />
            commitment of the Government to protect
            <lb />
            the interests of the Scheduled Castes and
            <lb />
            the Scheduled Tribes, the Government have
            <lb />
            decided to continue the existing policy of
            <lb />
            reservation in promotion for the Scheduled
            <lb />
            Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. To carry
            <lb />
            out this, it is necessary to amend Article 16
            <lb />
            of the Constitution by inserting a new
            <lb />
            Clause (4A) in the said Article to provide

            for reservation in promotion for the

            belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the

        <p>
            2. The Government has reviewed the
            <lb />
            position in the light of views received from
            <lb />
            various quarters and in order to protect

            the interest of the Government servants

            belonging to the Scheduled Castes and

            negate the effect of O.M. dated 30th
            <lb />
            January

            benefits to such Government servants will
            <lb />
            also be necessary. This will require

            <lb />
            Constitution to provide for consequential

            STATEMENT
            <lb />
            OF

            <lb />
            AND
            <lb />
            REASONS.-Prior to August 29, 1997, the
            <lb />
            vacancies reserved for the Scheduled
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            119
            <lb />
            Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, which
            <lb />
            could not be filled up by direct recruitment
            <lb />
            on account of non-availability of the
            <lb />
            candidates belonging to the Scheduled
            <lb />
            Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, were
            <lb />
            treated as &quot;Backlog Vacancies&quot;. These
            <lb />
            vacancies were treated as a distinct group
            <lb />
            and were excluded from the ceiling of fifty
            <lb />
            per cent reservation. The Supreme Court
            <lb />
            of India in its judgment in the Indra
            <lb />
            Sawhney v. Union of India held that the
            <lb />
            number of vacancies to be filled up on the
            <lb />
            basis of reservations in a year including
            <lb />
            carried forward reservations should in no
            <lb />
            case exceed the limit of fifty per cent. As
            <lb />
            total reservations in a year for the
            <lb />
            Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes
            <lb />
            and the other Backward Classes combined
            <lb />
            together had already reached forty-nine
            <lb />
            and a half per cent and the total number of
            <lb />
            vacancies to be filled up in a year could not
            <lb />
            exceed fifty per cent, it became difficult
            <lb />
            to fill the &quot;Backlog Vacancies&quot; and to hold
            <lb />
            Special Recruitment Drives. Therefore, to
            <lb />
            implement the judgment of the Supreme
            <lb />
            Court, an Official Memorandum dated
            <lb />
            August 29, 1997 was issued to provide that
            <lb />
            the fifty per cent limit shall apply to
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016

            current as well as &quot;Backlog Vacancies&quot; and

        <p>
            2. Due to the adverse effect of the
            <lb />
            aforesaid order dated August 29, 1997,
            <lb />
            various
            <lb />
            organisations
            <lb />
            including
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            Members of Parliament represented to the
            <lb />
            central Government for protecting the
            <lb />
            interest of the Scheduled castes and the
            <lb />
            Scheduled Tribes. The Government, after
            <lb />
            considering
            <lb />
            various
            <lb />
            representations,
            <lb />
            reviewed the position and has decided to
            <lb />
            make amendment in the constitution so
            <lb />
            that the unfilled vacancies of a year, which
            <lb />
            are reserved for being filled up in that
            <lb />
            year in accordance with any provision for
            <lb />
            reservation made under Clause (4) or
            <lb />
            Clause (4A) of Article 16 of the
            <lb />
            Constitution, shall be considered as a
            <lb />
            separate class of vacancies to be filled up
            <lb />
            in any succeeding year or years and such
            <lb />
            class of vacancies shall not be considered

            together with the vacancies of the year in
            <lb />
            which they are being filled up for
            <lb />
            determining the ceiling of fifty percent,
            <lb />
            reservation on total number of vacancies of
            <lb />
            that year. This amendment in the
            <lb />
            Constitution would enable the State to
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016

            <lb />
            before august 29, 1997.

            3. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid
            <lb />
            object.
            <lb />
            An Act further to amend the Constitution
            <lb />
            of India.
            <lb />
            Be it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-
            <lb />
            first Year of the Republic of India as
            <lb />
            follows:
            <lb />
            1. Short title: This Act may be called the
            <lb />
            Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment)
            <lb />
            Act, 2000.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            2. Amendment of Article 16: In Article 16
            <lb />
            of the Constitution, after Clause (4A), the
            <lb />
            following Clause shall be inserted, namely: -
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (4B) Nothing in this Article shall
            <lb />
            prevent the State from considering
            <lb />
            any unfilled vacancies of a year which
            <lb />
            are reserved for being filled up in that
            <lb />
            year in accordance with any provision
            <lb />
            for reservation made under Clause (4)
            <lb />
            or Clause (4A) as a separate class of
            <lb />
            vacancies to be filled up in any
            <lb />
            succeeding year or years and such
            <lb />
            class of vacancies shall not be
            <lb />
            considered
            <lb />
            together
            <lb />
            with
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            122
            <lb />
            vacancies of the year in which they are
            <lb />
            being filled up for determining the
            <lb />
            ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on
            <lb />
            total number of vacancies of that
            <lb />
            year.&quot;
            <lb />
            The conclusions drawn by the Apex Court make a
            <lb />
            reference of ceiling of 50 per cent reservation apart from
            <lb />
            the concept of creamy-layer. The administrative efficiency is
            <lb />
            a constitutional requirement to maintain structure of equality
            <lb />
            of opportunity in public employment.
            <lb />
            Para No.100 of the judgment in the case of
            <lb />
            M.Nagaraj &amp; Ors. (supra) concludes with following finding : As
            <lb />
            stated above, Article 16(4B) lifts the 50% cap on carry-over
            <lb />
            vacancies (backlog vacancies). The ceiling-limit of 50% on current
            <lb />
            vacancies continues to remain.
            <lb />
            Para 123 of the judgment is also relevant where
            <lb />
            following conclusion was drawn : It is made clear that even if the
            <lb />
            State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will have
            <lb />
            to see that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness
            <lb />
            so as to breach the ceiling-limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy
            <lb />
            layer or extend the reservation indefinitely. The ceiling of 50 per
            <lb />
            cent is thus reiterated therein while upholding the
            <lb />
            amendment in Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B).
            <lb />

            <lb />
            123
            <lb />
            In the case of Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra),
            <lb />
            various issues were considered again, which includes, as to
            <lb />
            whether identification of backward classes can be based on
            <lb />
            &quot;caste&quot;. After considering various judgments of the Apex
            <lb />
            Court, it was held that &quot;caste&quot; cannot be the sole basis for
            <lb />
            identification of backward classes and if it is determined
            <lb />
            based on caste alone, it would violate Article 15(1) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India. The caste was, however, permitted to
            <lb />
            be starting point to find out as to whether the &quot;caste&quot; as a
            <lb />
            whole can be classified as a backward class. In view of the
            <lb />
            aforesaid, the &quot;caste&quot; can be taken into consideration to find
            <lb />
            out backwardness but it cannot be the sole basis, otherwise,
            <lb />
            it will hit Articles 15(1) and 16 of the Constitution of India.
            <lb />
            In the case of Anil Chandra &amp; Ors. Vs. Radha
            <lb />
            Krishna Gaur &amp; Ors. reported in 2009 (9) SCC 454 same
            <lb />
            issue was decided. Para Nos.17 &amp; 18 of the said judgment are
            <lb />
            quoted hereunder for ready reference :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>&quot;</p>

        <p>
            17. In the present case and in the facts and
            <lb />
            circumstances stated herein earlier, we are of
            <lb />
            the view that it was the constitutional
            <lb />
            obligation of the State, at the time of
            <lb />
            providing reservation in the matter of
            <lb />
            124
            <lb />
            promotion to identify the class or classes of
            <lb />
            posts in the service for which reservation is
            <lb />
            required, however, neither any effort has been
            <lb />
            made to identify the class or classes of posts
            <lb />
            for which reservation is to be provided in
            <lb />
            promotion nor any exercise has been done to
            <lb />
            quantify the extent of reservation. Adequate
            <lb />
            reservation does not mean proportional
            <lb />
            representation. Rule 8(A) has been inserted
            <lb />
            mechanically without taking into consideration
            <lb />
            the prerequisites for making such a provision
            <lb />
            as required under Article 16(4A) of the
            <lb />
            Constitution of India. The ceiling-limit of
            <lb />
            50%, the concept of creamy layer and the
            <lb />
            compelling reasons, namely, backwardness,
            <lb />
            inadequacy of representation and overall
            <lb />
            administrative efficiency are all constitutional
            <lb />
            requirements without which, the structure of
            <lb />
            equality of opportunity in Article 16 would
            <lb />
            collapse. However, in this case, as stated, the
            <lb />
            main issue concerns the &quot;extent of
            <lb />
            reservation&quot; and in this regard, the State
            <lb />
            should have shown the existence of the
            <lb />
            compelling reasons, namely, backwardness,
            <lb />
            inadequacy of representation and overall
            <lb />
            administrative efficiency before making
            <lb />
            provision for reservation.

            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            18. As observed in M. Nagaraj and Ors. v.
            <lb />
            Union of India and Ors.(SCCP. 278, PARA
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            123) , it has been held that :
            <lb />
            &quot;123............The State is not bound to
            <lb />
            make reservation for SC/ST in matter
            <lb />
            of promotions. However, if they wish to
            <lb />
            exercise their discretion and make such
            <lb />
            provision, the State has to collect
            <lb />
            quantifiable data showing backwardness
            <lb />
            of the class and inadequacy of
            <lb />
            representation of that class in public
            <lb />
            employment in addition to compliance of
            <lb />
            Article 335of the Constitution. It is
            <lb />
            clear that even if the State has
            <lb />
            compelling reasons, as stated above, the
            <lb />
            State will have to see that its
            <lb />
            reservation provision does not lead to
            <lb />
            excessiveness so as to breach the
            <lb />
            ceiling-limit of 50% or obliterate the
            <lb />
            creamy layer or extend the reservation
            <lb />
            indefinitely.&quot;
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            The paras, quoted above, show the extent of
            <lb />
            reservation. The judgment in the case of M.Nagaraj &amp; Ors.
            <lb />
            (supra) has been referred to show ceiling of 50 per cent
            <lb />
            under Article 16(4B) of the Constitution on vacancy of the
            <lb />
            year. It is also held that reservation cannot be provided on
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            126
            <lb />
            proportional representation.
            <lb />
            The judgment in the case of Suraj Bhan Meena
            <lb />
            (supra) has also been referred by learned counsel for the
            <lb />
            petitioners to support their arguments. The Apex Court in
            <lb />
            the said judgment held that quantifiable data is a condition
            <lb />
            precedent to show inadequate representation of members of
            <lb />
            Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The reservation
            <lb />
            without quantifiable data would be illegal.
            <lb />
            The other judgment referred by learned counsel
            <lb />
            for the petitioners is in the case of UP Power Corporation
            <lb />
            (supra). Para No.81 of the said judgment is quoted hereunder
            <lb />
            where conclusion on the various issues has been drawn by the
            <lb />
            Apex Court :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            &quot;81. From the aforesaid decision in M. Nagaraj
            <lb />
            Case and the paragraphs we have quoted
            <lb />
            hereinabove, the following principles can be
            <lb />
            carved out:
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (i) Vesting of the power by an enabling
            <lb />
            provision may be constitutionally valid
            <lb />
            and yet &apos;exercise of power&apos; by the
            <lb />
            State in a given case may be arbitrary,
            <lb />
            particularly, if the State fails to
            <lb />
            127
            <lb />
            identify and measure backwardness and
            <lb />
            inadequacy keeping in mind the
            <lb />
            efficiency of service as required under
            <lb />
            Article 335.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (ii) Article 16(4) which protects the
            <lb />
            interests of certain sections of the
            <lb />
            society has to be balanced against
            <lb />
            Article 16(1) which protects the
            <lb />
            interests of every citizen of the entire
            <lb />
            society. They should be harmonized
            <lb />
            because they are restatements of the
            <lb />
            principle of equality under Article 14.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (iii) Each post gets marked for the
            <lb />
            particular category of candidates to be
            <lb />
            appointed against it and any subsequent
            <lb />
            vacancy has to be filled by that
            <lb />
            category candidate.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (iv) The appropriate Government has to
            <lb />
            apply the cadre strength as a unit in the
            <lb />
            operation of the roster in order to
            <lb />
            ascertain whether a given class/group is
            <lb />
            adequately represented in the service.
            <lb />
            The cadre strength as a unit also
            <lb />
            ensures that the upper ceiling-limit of
            <lb />
            50% is not violated. Further roster has
            <lb />

            <lb />
            128
            <lb />
            to be post-specific and not vacancy
            <lb />
            based.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (v) The State has to form its opinion on
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            quantifiable
            <lb />
            data
            <lb />
            regarding
            <lb />
            adequacy of representation. Clause (4A)
            <lb />
            of Article 16 is an enabling provision. It
            <lb />
            gives freedom to the State to provide
            <lb />
            for
            <lb />
            reservation
            <lb />
            in
            <lb />
            matters
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            promotion. Clause (4A) of Article16
            <lb />
            applies only to SCs and STs. The said
            <lb />
            clause is carved out of Article 16(4A).
            <lb />
            Therefore, Clause (4A) will be governed
            <lb />
            by the two compelling reasons -
            <lb />
            &quot;backwardness&quot; and &quot;inadequacy of
            <lb />
            representation&quot;, as mentioned in Article
            <lb />
            16(4). If the said two reasons do not
            <lb />
            exist, then the enabling provision
            <lb />
            cannot be enforced.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (vi) If the ceiling-limit on the carry-
            <lb />
            over of unfilled vacancies is removed,
            <lb />
            the other alternative time-factor
            <lb />
            comes in and in that event, the time-
            <lb />
            scale has to be imposed in the interest
            <lb />
            of efficiency in administration as
            <lb />
            mandated by Article 335. If the time-
            <lb />
            scale is not kept, then posts will
            <lb />
            continue to remain vacant for years
            <lb />
            129
            <lb />
            which would be detrimental to the
            <lb />
            administration. Therefore, in each case,
            <lb />
            the appropriate Government will now
            <lb />
            have to introduce the duration
            <lb />
            depending upon the fact-situation.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (vii) If the appropriate Government
            <lb />
            enacts a law providing for reservation
            <lb />
            without keeping in mind the parameters
            <lb />
            in Article16(4) and Article 335, then
            <lb />
            this Court will certainly set aside and
            <lb />
            strike down such legislation.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (viii) The constitutional limitation under
            <lb />
            Article 335 is relaxed and not
            <lb />
            obliterated. As stated above, be it
            <lb />
            reservation or evaluation, excessiveness
            <lb />
            in either would result in violation of the
            <lb />
            constitutional mandate. This exercise,
            <lb />
            however, will depend on the facts of
            <lb />
            each case.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (ix) The concepts of efficiency,
            <lb />
            backwardness
            <lb />
            and
            <lb />
            inadequacy
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            representation are required to be
            <lb />
            identified and measured. That exercise
            <lb />
            depends on the availability of data. That
            <lb />
            exercise depends on numerous factors.
            <lb />
            It is for this reason that the enabling
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            130
            <lb />
            provisions are required to be made
            <lb />
            because each competing claim seeks to
            <lb />
            achieve certain goals. How best one
            <lb />
            should optimize these conflicting claims
            <lb />
            can only be done by the administration
            <lb />
            in the context of local prevailing
            <lb />
            conditions in public employment.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (x) Article 16(4), therefore, creates a
            <lb />
            field which enables a State to
            <lb />
            provide for reservation provided
            <lb />
            there exists backwardness of a
            <lb />
            class
            <lb />
            and
            <lb />
            inadequacy
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            representation in employment.
            <lb />
            These are compelling reasons.
            <lb />
            They do not exist in Article 16(1).
            <lb />
            It is only when these reasons are
            <lb />
            satisfied that a State gets the
            <lb />
            power to provide for reservation
            <lb />
            in the matter of employment.
            <lb />
            The summary of the conclusions shows as to how
            <lb />
            and up to what extent reservation can be provided.
            <lb />
            The judgment in the case of S.V.Joshi &amp; ors.
            <lb />

        <p>
            (supra) has been relied by learned Solicitor General of India
            <lb />
            so as the private respondents. The reservation can exceed
            <lb />

            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS

            (supra) and Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra) apart from other
            <lb />
            judgments has been given in para 13 of judgment in the case
            <lb />
            of S.V. Joshi &amp; Ors. (supra), which is quoted hereunder for
            <lb />

            &quot;13. Further, after the filing of the writ
            <lb />
            petition, various pronouncements have
            <lb />
            been made by the judgments of the
            <lb />
            Constitution Benches of this Court in
            <lb />
            M.Nagaraj v. Union of India and Ashoka

            <lb />
            the said decisions, which have been

            rendered in the light of the Constitution

            Amendment) Act, 2005, reservation
            <lb />
            exceeding fifty per cent could be made
            <lb />
            only on the basis of quantifiable data
            <lb />
            before the Government. It appears that
            <lb />
            till today, this exercise has not been
            <lb />
            undertaken and the State Government
            <lb />
            has not collected the quantifiable data.

            It has not presented such data before

            the Court.&quot;
            <lb />
            The writ petition therein was filed before
            <lb />
            pronouncement of the judgment by the Constitutional Bench
            <lb />
            of the Supreme Court in the case of M.Nagaraj &amp; Ors. (supra)
            <lb />
            and Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra). The reference of those
            <lb />
            judgments has been given in the para quoted above. Learned
            <lb />
            counsel appeared therein did not make a reference of Article
            <lb />
            16(4B) of the Constitution of India though, reference of the
            <lb />
            constitutional amendment has been made. Para 10 of the
            <lb />
            judgment in the case of S.V.Joshi &amp; Ors. (supra) is quoted
            <lb />
            hereunder, which clarify that State action should be subject
            <lb />
            to the subsequent judgment of the Apex Court in the cases
            <lb />
            referred above thus the judgment aforesaid has to be read in

            reference to the aforesaid :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            &quot;10. We may state that, subsequent to
            <lb />
            the filing of this writ petition in 1994,
            <lb />
            Article 15 and 16 of the Constitution
            <lb />
            have been amended vide the Constitution
            <lb />

            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            Constitution
            <lb />
            (Eighty-first
            <lb />
            Amendment) Act, 2000, respectively.
            <lb />
            Moreover, subsequent decisions in
            <lb />
            M.Nagaraj v. Union of India and Ashoka
            <lb />
            Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, are also
            <lb />
            required to be kept in mind by the State
            <lb />
            Government, if at all, it seeks to pass any
            <lb />
            other order in near future.&quot;
            <lb />
            The judgment of the Apex Court in the case of M.
            <lb />
            Nagaraj (supra) held ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation in
            <lb />
            reference to Article 16(4B) of the Constitution (see para 100,
            <lb />
            110 and 121 to 124).
            <lb />
            The judgment in the case of B.Archana Reddy &amp;
            <lb />
            Ors. (supra) has also been relied. Para Nos. 191 &amp; 192 of the
            <lb />
            said judgment are quoted hereunder for ready reference :
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            &quot;191. This point requires consideration of two
            <lb />
            aspects. Accepting the recommendation of B.C.
            <lb />
            Commission, the impugned Ordinance provides
            <lb />
            5% reservation for Muslims over and above the
            <lb />
            existing 46% reservation. With this, 51 % of
            <lb />
            the positions in educational institutions and
            <lb />
            public employment would become reserved.
            <lb />
            According to the learned Counsel, reservation
            <lb />
            of 51 % is unreasonable and violates Articles
            <lb />
            15(4) and 16(4) as well as Balaji principle
            <lb />
            approved by Indra Sawhney I. Per contra, two
            <lb />
            134
            <lb />
            submissions are made on behalf of the
            <lb />
            respondents. The learned Advocate General
            <lb />
            for the State would contend that provision of
            <lb />
            reservations for Muslims by declaring them as
            <lb />
            backward is valid. The same cannot be
            <lb />
            defeated by the quantum of reservation
            <lb />
            provided, in which event, the Court can always
            <lb />
            approve the reservations in favour of Muslims
            <lb />
            and leave it to the State to work out the
            <lb />
            percentage of reservation in the manner
            <lb />
            construed by the Court. So to say as an
            <lb />
            alternate submission he would urge to consider
            <lb />
            retaining Section 3 and severing Sections 4
            <lb />
            and 5of the Ordinance which provides 5%
            <lb />
            reservation. The other learned Counsel
            <lb />
            supporting the Ordinance are emphatic that
            <lb />
            provision of 51% reservation including 5% for
            <lb />
            Muslims does not in any manner impinge the law
            <lb />
            declared by the Supreme Court. According to
            <lb />
            the learned Counsel, the extra 1% is saved by
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            prevalent
            <lb />
            &quot;extraordinary
            <lb />
            situation&quot;
            <lb />
            referred to by the Supreme Court in
            <lb />
            paragraph 810 of Indra Sawhney I. Sri R.K.
            <lb />
            Dhawan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
            <lb />
            one of the interveners in W.P.No. 13832 of
            <lb />
            2005 would urge that the excess over 50%
            <lb />
            being only 1% is &apos;de minimis&apos; (&apos;De minimis&apos;
            <lb />
            means &quot;the Law does not care for or take
            <lb />
            135
            <lb />
            notice of very small or triffling matters&quot;, (see
            <lb />
            Black&apos;s Law Dictionary; 1990 edn. p.431)), that
            <lb />
            Muslim population being 9.25%, provision of 5%
            <lb />
            reservation to them cannot be said unjustified
            <lb />
            and that percentages are to be reviewed on
            <lb />
            periodical basis and therefore, would not
            <lb />
            furnish the valid ground for invalidation of the
            <lb />
            Ordinance. We may mention that doctrine of
            <lb />
            &apos;de minimis&apos; has no application when the
            <lb />
            constitutional guarantee to equality and equal
            <lb />
            protection of laws is flouted with impunity,
            <lb />
            without any justification. If 1 % excess
            <lb />
            reservation cannot be sustained on any such

            192. In Balaji, the Supreme Court adverted to
            <lb />
            question of reasonableness of reservation
            <lb />
            exceeding 50%. On the premise that Clause (4)
            <lb />
            of Article 15 and Clause (4) of Article 16(4)
            <lb />
            being in the nature of exception, it was held
            <lb />
            that a special provision contemplated under
            <lb />
            these clauses must be within reasonable limits.
            <lb />
            The Court then observed that, &quot;speaking
            <lb />
            generally and in a broad way, a special provision
            <lb />
            should be less than 50%; how much less than
            <lb />
            50% would depend upon the relevant prevailing

            <lb />
            enabling provision in two articles is an
            <lb />
            exception was not accepted in Thomas. But,
            <lb />
            rule of 50% reservation survived in Thomas,

            Vasanth Kumar and Indra Sawhney I. In the
            <lb />
            last cited decision, majority explained this rule
            <lb />
            as under.
            <lb />
            While 50% shall be the rule, it is
            <lb />
            necessary not to put out of diversity of
            <lb />
            this country and the people. It might
            <lb />
            happen that in farflung and remote
            <lb />
            areas the population inhabiting those
            <lb />
            areas might, on account of their being
            <lb />

            given. In the said case also, width of reservation was
            <lb />
            considered. The reservation was provided to the extent of 73
            <lb />
            per cent. The Bombay High Court framed the question about
            <lb />
            cap of 50 per cent reservation. The summary of all the
            <lb />
            judgments of the Apex Court has been given in para Nos.12 to

            In the case of M. Nagaraj &amp; Ors. (supra), the
            <lb />
            Supreme Court directed the concerned State to show
            <lb />
            compelling reasons in the form of quantifiable data showing
            <lb />
            backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation
            <lb />
            of that class in public employment, in addition to compliance
            <lb />
            of Article 335 of the Constitution of India for maintaining
            <lb />
            administrative efficiency. Thus, the direction in the case of
            <lb />
            M.Nagaraj (supra) was for collection of quantifiable data to
            <lb />
            show backwardness of the class and inadequacy of
            <lb />
            representation of that class in public employment for the
            <lb />
            purpose of justifying the extent of reservations in favour of
            <lb />
            that class even within 50 per cent ceiling limit of
            <lb />
            reservations.
            <lb />
            Moreover, as recently as on 15 July 2014 in
            <lb />
            Rohtas Bhankhar vs. Union of India reported in 2014(8)
            <lb />
            SCC 872 , another Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court
            <lb />
            has reiterated the conclusions recorded in the case of M.
            <lb />
            Nagaraj &amp; Ors. (supra).
            <lb />
            For the aforesaid reasons, prima facie, we are of
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            view
            <lb />

            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            reservation
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            appointments/posts in public services, after the constitutional
            <lb />
            amendments in the year 2000, the Supreme Court has laid
            <lb />
            down a constitutional mandate that &quot;the State will have to see
            <lb />
            that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness
            <lb />
            so as to breach the ceiling limit of 50 per cent. In view of the
            <lb />
            law laid down by the Supreme Court in such emphatic terms,
            <lb />
            no exceptions are permitted.
            <lb />
            The order of the Bombay High Court in the case
            <lb />
            of Sanjeet Shukla (supra) was not interfered by the Apex
            <lb />
            Court on its challenge. The observation about ceiling limit of
            <lb />
            50 per cent given under Article 16(4B) of the Constitution of
            <lb />
            India has been endorsed without exception. Therein, the
            <lb />
            judgment in the case of Rohtas Bhankhar (supra) has also
            <lb />
            been referred.

            The judgment in the case of Ram Singh &amp; Ors.
            <lb />
            (supra) was on the reservation to &quot;Jaats&quot; and has been struck
            <lb />
            down by the Apex Court. It includes reservation to Jaats of
            <lb />
            Dholpur and Bharatpur in OBC category in the State of
            <lb />
            Rajasthan also.
            <lb />
            The summary of the judgments, referred above,
            <lb />
            reveals that ceiling of 50 per cent on reservation is a rule,
            <lb />
            excess to it can be in extra ordinary situation, which should
            <lb />
            be based on quantifiable data.
            <lb />
            The constitutional amendment thereupon in
            <lb />
            Article 16 (4B) of the Constitution, however, does not show
            <lb />
            permissibility of reservation above 50 per cent for the
            <lb />
            vacancies of the year. The exception is for backlog vacancies.
            <lb />
            If true meaning of the constitutional provisions is taken,
            <lb />
            ceiling of 50 per cent for the vacancies of the year, in which,
            <lb />
            it is to be filled, exists. The State cannot provide reservation
            <lb />
            beyond 50 per cent of the vacancies of the year, in which, it
            <lb />
            is to be filled. The judgment on the constitutional amendment
            <lb />
            shows permission to cross the ceiling of 50 per cent in a given
            <lb />
            case but learned counsel, appearing in those cases, did not
            <lb />
            refer to basic structure of the amended provisions of Article
            <lb />

            <lb />
            16(4B) of the Constitution of India and, in any case, ceiling of
            <lb />
            50 per cent of the reservation needs to be applied as a rule
            <lb />
            on the vacancies of the year, in which, it is to be filled.
            <lb />
            Article 16(4B) of the Constitution puts a cap of 50 per cent
            <lb />
            on reservation on the vacancies of the year. To consider, para
            <lb />
            Nos.100, 110 and 121 to 124 in the case of M. Nagaraj &amp; Ors.
            <lb />
            (supra) are quoted hereunder and is an answer to the
            <lb />
            question:
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            &quot;100. As stated above, Article 16(4B) lifts the
            <lb />
            50% cap on carry-over vacancies (backlog
            <lb />
            vacancies). The ceiling-limit of 50% on
            <lb />
            current vacancies continues to remain. In
            <lb />
            working-out the carry-forward rule, two
            <lb />
            factors are required to be kept in mind,
            <lb />
            namely, unfilled vacancies and the time
            <lb />
            factor. This position needs to be explained.
            <lb />
            On one hand of the spectrum, we have
            <lb />
            unfilled vacancies; on the other hand, we have
            <lb />
            a time-spread over number of years over
            <lb />
            which unfilled vacancies are sought to be
            <lb />
            carried-over. These two are alternating
            <lb />
            factors and, therefore, if the ceiling-limit on
            <lb />
            the carry-over of unfilled vacancies is
            <lb />
            removed, the other alternative time-factor
            <lb />
            comes in and in that event, the time-scale has
            <lb />
            141
            <lb />
            to be imposed in the interest of efficiency in
            <lb />
            administration as mandated by Article 335. If
            <lb />
            the time-scale is not kept then posts will
            <lb />
            continue to remain vacant for years, which
            <lb />
            would be detrimental to the administration.
            <lb />
            Therefore, in each case, the appropriate
            <lb />
            Government will now have to introduce the
            <lb />
            time-cap depending upon the fact-situation.
            <lb />
            What is stated hereinabove is borne out by
            <lb />
            Service Rules in some of the States where
            <lb />
            the carry-over rule does not extend beyond
            <lb />
            three years.

            110. As stated above, the boundaries of the
            <lb />
            width of the power, namely, the ceiling-limit
            <lb />
            of 50% (the numerical benchmark), the
            <lb />
            principle of creamy layer, the compelling
            <lb />
            reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            representation
            <lb />
            and
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            overall
            <lb />
            administrative
            <lb />
            efficiency
            <lb />
            are
            <lb />
            not
            <lb />
            obliterated by the impugned amendments.
            <lb />
            At the appropriate time, we have to consider
            <lb />
            the law as enacted by various States
            <lb />
            providing for reservation if challenged. At
            <lb />
            that time we have to see whether limitations
            <lb />
            on the exercise of power are violated. The
            <lb />
            State is free to exercise its discretion of
            <lb />
            providing for reservation subject to
            <lb />
            142
            <lb />
            limitation, namely, that there must exist
            <lb />
            compelling
            <lb />
            reasons
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            backwardness,
            <lb />
            inadequacy of representation in a class of
            <lb />
            post(s) keeping in mind the overall
            <lb />
            administrative efficiency. It is made clear
            <lb />
            that even if the State has reasons to make
            <lb />
            reservation, as stated above, if the
            <lb />
            impugned law violates any of the above
            <lb />
            substantive limits on the width of the power
            <lb />
            the same would be liable to be set aside.

            <lb />
            State
            <lb />
            administration under Article 335. These
            <lb />
            impugned amendments are confined only to
            <lb />
            SCs and STs. They do not obliterate any of
            <lb />
            the constitutional requirements, namely,
            <lb />
            ceiling-limit
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            50%
            <lb />
            (quantitative
            <lb />
            limitation), the concept of creamy layer
            <lb />
            143
            <lb />
            (qualitative
            <lb />
            exclusion),
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            sub-
            <lb />
            classification between OBC on one hand and
            <lb />
            SCs and STs on the other hand as held in
            <lb />
            Indra Sawhney, the concept of post-based
            <lb />
            Roster with in-built concept of replacement
            <lb />
            as held in R.K. Sabharwal.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            122. We reiterate that the ceiling-limit of
            <lb />
            50%, the concept of creamy layer and the
            <lb />
            compelling reasons, namely, backwardness,
            <lb />
            inadequacy of representation and overall
            <lb />
            administrative
            <lb />
            efficiency
            <lb />
            are
            <lb />
            all
            <lb />
            constitutional requirements without which
            <lb />
            the structure of equality of opportunity in
            <lb />
            Article 16 would collapse.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            123. However, in this case, as stated, the
            <lb />
            main issue concerns the &quot;extent of
            <lb />
            reservation&quot;. In this regard the concerned
            <lb />
            State will have to show in each case the
            <lb />
            existence of the compelling reasons,
            <lb />
            namely, backwardness, inadequacy of
            <lb />
            representation and overall administrative
            <lb />
            efficiency before making provision for
            <lb />
            reservation. As stated above, the impugned
            <lb />
            provision is an enabling provision. The State
            <lb />
            is not bound to make reservation for SC/ST
            <lb />
            in matter of promotions. However if they
            <lb />
            wish to exercise their discretion and make
            <lb />
            such provision, the State has to collect
            <lb />
            quantifiable data showing backwardness of
            <lb />
            the class and inadequacy of representation
            <lb />
            of that class in public employment in
            <lb />
            addition to compliance of Article335. It is
            <lb />
            made clear that even if the State has
            <lb />
            compelling reasons, as stated above, the
            <lb />
            State will have to see that its reservation
            <lb />
            provision does not lead to excessiveness so
            <lb />
            as to breach the ceiling-limit of 50% or
            <lb />
            obliterate the creamy layer or extend the
            <lb />
            reservation indefinitely.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            124. Subject to above, we uphold the
            <lb />
            constitutional validity of the Constitution
            <lb />
            (Seventy-Seventh Amendment) Act, 1995,
            <lb />
            the Constitution (Eighty-First Amendment)
            <lb />
            Act, 2000, the Constitution (Eighty-Second
            <lb />
            Amendment) Act, 2000 and the Constitution
            <lb />
            (Eighty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 2001.&quot;
            <lb />
            In the light of the discussion made above, we hold
            <lb />
            that as per Article 16(4B) of the Constitution of India, ceiling
            <lb />
            of 50 per cent on reservation on the vacancies of the year, in
            <lb />
            which they are to be filled, exists. The exception is for the
            <lb />
            backlog or unfilled post/s of previous year/years.
            <lb />
            Extent of Judicial Review :
            <lb />
            It is urged on behalf of the State and the
            <lb />
            protagonists of the Act of 2015 that this Court does not sit
            <lb />
            in appeal over the expert analysis by the Commission or the
            <lb />
            subjective satisfaction of the State with regard to
            <lb />
            backwardness of five castes. All these areas are consecrated
            <lb />
            to the realm of the policy choices of the State and no
            <lb />
            interference is called for.
            <lb />
            In Indra Sahwney&apos;s case, after tracing the
            <lb />
            meandering course of review standard applications by the
            <lb />
            U.S. Supreme Court, from De Funis v. Charles Odegaard 416
            <lb />
            US 312 (1974) to Metro Broadcasting Inc v. Federal
            <lb />
            Communications Commission, 497 US 547 (1990), no single,
            <lb />
            uniform pattern of thought can be discerned from these
            <lb />
            decisions and the ideas appear to be still in the process of
            <lb />
            evolution. (Indra Sahwney, para 732). Dealing with the
            <lb />
            question as to the extent of judicial review in issues of
            <lb />
            identification of Backward Classes and the percentage of
            <lb />
            reservations made for such classes, it was observed that
            <lb />
            there is no particular or special standard of judicial scrutiny
            <lb />
            in matters arising under Articles 15(4) and 16(4). The extent
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            146
            <lb />
            and scope of judicial scrutiny depends upon the nature of the
            <lb />
            subject-matter, the nature of the right affected, the
            <lb />
            character of the legal and constitutional provisions applicable
            <lb />
            and so on.
            <lb />
            It was considered whether the policy of the
            <lb />
            Government could be subject to judicial review. Referring to
            <lb />
            catena of Supreme Court judgments on the extent of judicial
            <lb />
            review of the policy choices of Government, the Apex Court in
            <lb />
            the case of Indra Sahwney (supra) held that the action of the
            <lb />
            Government making a provision for reservation in favour of
            <lb />
            any Backward Class of citizens is a matter of policy of the
            <lb />
            Government; what is best for the Backward Classes and in
            <lb />
            what manner the policy should be formulated and implemented
            <lb />
            bearing in mind the object to be achieved by such
            <lb />
            reservations is a matter for decision exclusively within the
            <lb />
            province of the Government and such matters do not
            <lb />
            ordinarily attract the power of judicial review, except on
            <lb />
            settled grounds( perversity and the like).
            <lb />
            Sawant, J. reiterated the decision adopted by
            <lb />
            Jeevan Reddy. J and concluded that there are no special
            <lb />
            principles of judicial review nor does the scope of judicial
            <lb />
            147
            <lb />
            review expand when the identification of Backward Class and
            <lb />
            the percentage of reservations kept for them is called in
            <lb />
            question. So long as the correct criterion for the
            <lb />
            identification of Backward Class is applied, the result arrived
            <lb />
            at cannot be questioned on the ground that other valid
            <lb />
            criteria was also available for such identification. The result
            <lb />
            arrived at even if marginally defective would not violate the
            <lb />
            exercise; No method is perfect when sociological findings are
            <lb />
            in issue. It was, however, emphasised that when the criterion
            <lb />
            applied for identifying Backward Class is either perverse or
            <lb />
            per se defective or unrelated to such identification and even
            <lb />
            if, it is not calculated to give the result or is calculated to
            <lb />
            give, by the very nature of the criterion, a contrary or
            <lb />
            unintended result, the criterion is open for judicial
            <lb />
            examination.
            <lb />
            It is the State which has to form an opinion
            <lb />
            whether the conditions postulated for reservations are
            <lb />
            satisfied, however, the satisfaction on the basis of which an
            <lb />
            opinion is formed by the State must be rationally supported
            <lb />
            by objective criteria; considering all relevant matters and
            <lb />
            eschewing all irrelevant matters; after a proper assessment
            <lb />
            148
            <lb />
            of the competing claims of classes of citizens. It should
            <lb />
            evaluate relative backwardness before the conclusion that
            <lb />
            particular classes of citizens are so backward and so
            <lb />
            inadequately represented in the public services as to be
            <lb />
            worthy of special protection by means of reservation. It was
            <lb />
            held that State action, whether legislative or executive, is
            <lb />
            open to challenge if in conflict with the Constitution, the
            <lb />
            governing Act or the general principles of the land or is so
            <lb />
            arbitrary and unreasonable that no fair-minded authority
            <lb />
            would ever have made it.
            <lb />
            After a brief survey of the standards of judicial
            <lb />
            review and scrutiny applied to test suspect classifications by
            <lb />
            the U.S. decisions, held that though the State has substantial
            <lb />
            latitude in determination of either backwardness or the
            <lb />
            inadequacy of representation, if the principles for
            <lb />
            identification are invalid, the classification violates
            <lb />
            constitutional limits, if the analysis is illegal and invalid or the
            <lb />
            policy is adopted for extraneous considerations, the Court
            <lb />
            could apply the corrective. The legality must be weighed
            <lb />
            alongside the guaranteed rights to citizens and the Court may
            <lb />
            &quot;smoke out&quot; any illegitimate use or transgression of the
            <lb />
            constitutional limits.
            <lb />
            From an analysis of the several opinions in the
            <lb />
            case of Indra Sahwney (supra), as to the appropriate
            <lb />
            standards of judicial review in matters pertaining to
            <lb />
            affirmative action, it appears to us that the area is broadly
            <lb />
            left open. What is clear however is that the extent and level
            <lb />
            of scrutiny is relative to the legal or constitutional right and
            <lb />
            interest involved in a specific claim, presented before the
            <lb />
            Court.

            When a reservation policy of the State is
            <lb />
            challenged, several issues fall into consideration. These are;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (a) The constitutional limits within which State action may be
            <lb />
            pursued, such as the explicit or clearly implied constitutional
            <lb />
            prohibitions as to classificatory parameters;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (b) The relevance or rationality of the criteria adopted by
            <lb />
            the State or an expert body accredited by the State to
            <lb />
            perform the exercise.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (c) The adequacy (in legal terms) of the data considered in
            <lb />
            the exercise;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (d) The rationality of the synthesis between the evolved
            <lb />
            criteria and the collected data, for analysis; and
            <lb />

            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            (e) The rationality of the conclusions arrived at by the expert
            <lb />
            body and the decision of the State.
            <lb />
            In our considered view, identification of an
            <lb />
            appropriate standard of review, relevant to the examination
            <lb />
            of the several steps and aspects involved in the State
            <lb />
            exercise of declaration of a Special Backward Class, lends
            <lb />
            clarity to the task of judicial review and advances coherence
            <lb />
            and consistency to litigative outcomes. In view of the above,
            <lb />
            judicial review is not barred but jurisdiction would be limited
            <lb />
            to the issues given above.
            <lb />
            On the Report of SBC Commission :
            <lb />
            The SBC Commission was reconstituted by the
            <lb />
            order dated 07 th /08 th June, 2012 and the Commission
            <lb />
            submitted its report in the month of November, 2012, i.e.,
            <lb />
            after four months of its constitution. The report is divided in
            <lb />
            ten chapters to deal with different heads.
            <lb />
            The procedure adopted by the SBC Commission is
            <lb />
            given in Chapter three. A reference of the report submitted
            <lb />
            by the IDS apart from primary and secondary data collected
            <lb />
            in relation to Backward/Special Backward Classes has given

            given. The State Government was requested to supply
            <lb />
            151
            <lb />
            comparative caste-wise data to find out representation of 82

            by Captain Gurvinder Singh and Samta Andolan Samiti, etc.
            <lb />
            has been given.
            <lb />
            Chapter Four refers to the memorandums for
            <lb />
            reservation of Special Backward Classes. The Commission has
            <lb />
            dealt with the representation of (i) Gujjar/Gurjars caste
            <lb />
            followed by (ii) Raika, Raibari (Debasi) caste, (iii) Banjara,
            <lb />
            Baladia, Labana caste, (iv) Gadia Lohar, Gadolia caste and (v)
            <lb />
            Gadaria (Gadari), Gayri caste.
            <lb />
            In Chapter Five, the objections and arguments of
            <lb />
            the petitioners and others have been referred.
            <lb />
            Chapter Six speaks about traditional and social
            <lb />
            background of castes referred above. In the said Chapter,
            <lb />
            consideration is mainly as to whether those castes fall in the
            <lb />
            category of Nomadic/Pastrolist. The perusal of the report
            <lb />
            shows reference of old record and literature to hold them to
            <lb />
            be Nomadic. It is not making reference of the present status
            <lb />
            of all the five castes or even of last ten years. The SBC
            <lb />
            Commission has drawn its conclusions based on the old
            <lb />
            material, which may not be so relevant for the status of those
            <lb />
            152
            <lb />
            castes at present. The literature taken into consideration is
            <lb />
            of &quot;Rajputane ka Itihas&quot; written by Gouri Shanker Heera
            <lb />
            Chand Ojha, Vikram Samvat 1993, which comes to the year
            <lb />
            1928 or 1929.
            <lb />
            A reference of &quot;Ramayan Era&quot; has also been given
            <lb />
            by the Commission without realising that they are not to write
            <lb />
            history of different castes. The Commission was expected to
            <lb />
            see status of the castes in relevant era. It may be of past ten
            <lb />
            years from the year 2012 or may be of 20 years. A reference
            <lb />
            of census of 1931 has also been given, though, the Apex Court
            <lb />
            has directed to re-consider the status of the castes every
            <lb />
            ten years. The Commission thus failed to make consideration
            <lb />
            in reference to the judgment of the Apex Court. It is when
            <lb />
            all the five castes are getting benefit of reservation for last
            <lb />
            few decades.
            <lb />
            Chapter Seven refers to the reports given by
            <lb />
            various Commissions and Committees. The indicators used by
            <lb />
            the Mandal Commission have also been referred. The basis to
            <lb />
            include Gurjar/Gujjar, Banjara, Raibari, Gadia Lohar, etc. in
            <lb />
            the category of special backward class has been taken into
            <lb />
            consideration.

            <lb />
            153
            <lb />
            A further reference of the report of Justice
            <lb />
            Jasraj Chopra Committee has been given for inclusion of
            <lb />
            Gurjar/Gujjar community in Scheduled Tribes apart from the
            <lb />
            report of Justice Shashikant Sharma Committee.
            <lb />
            In Chapter Eight, analysis of the judgments of
            <lb />
            the Apex Court has been made. The consideration of
            <lb />
            quantifiable data given by the State Government for
            <lb />
            reservation to five castes in Special Backward Class has been
            <lb />
            considered in Chapter Nine. Chapter Ten draws conclusion and
            <lb />
            makes recommendations. Therein, the report submitted by
            <lb />
            IDS has been discussed thoroughly.
            <lb />
            The IDS was directed to make assessment of 82
            <lb />
            castes and to submit report within six months. A survey was
            <lb />
            to be made by applying scientific method but, according to
            <lb />
            the report of SBC Commission, the IDS failed to apply
            <lb />
            scientific method, while making survey. The relevant part of
            <lb />
            the said report is quoted hereunder for ready reference :

            The SBC Commission considered various survey
            <lb />
            reports submitted by IDS. It was found to be contrary or
            <lb />
            against the public opinion in reference to various castes. The
            <lb />
            SBC Commission thus asked the IDS to clarify various issues,
            <lb />
            which were replied by IDS on 26 th October, 2012. Relevant

            The State Government supplied statements
            <lb />
            showing representation of various castes in the services from
            <lb />
            the year 2007 to 2012 but it is not for all the departments.
            <lb />
            The representation of various castes in the educational
            <lb />
            institutions has also been given. The SBC Commission
            <lb />
            164
            <lb />
            thereupon considered even the report of IDS, though, earlier
            <lb />
            said to be not based on proper survey.
            <lb />
            The State Government requested for six months
            <lb />
            time for survey of all the castes, but the Commission directed
            <lb />
            to collect data of last five years only, that too, in pursuance
            <lb />
            of the selection made by the RPSC. The report by the State
            <lb />
            Government is based on selection in Class I and Class II
            <lb />
            services only. This itself makes recommendation of the
            <lb />
            Commission to be defective and not in consonance to the
            <lb />
            judgment of the Apex Court. The Commission was required to
            <lb />
            get complete data of representation of 82 castes in all the
            <lb />
            departments and not of few and two classes of services. It
            <lb />
            even ignored the selection made by the departments at their
            <lb />
            own. This itself made their survey incomplete.
            <lb />
            If the report of IDS or the State Government
            <lb />
            for representation of various castes in the services is also
            <lb />
            taken into consideration, it shows &quot;zero&quot; representation of
            <lb />
            many castes, yet they were not taken into consideration while
            <lb />
            making recommendations.
            <lb />
            It seems that Commission was to make
            <lb />
            recommendations only for five castes, which were earlier
            <lb />
            165
            <lb />
            given special reservation leaving other castes though it
            <lb />
            should have made proper survey of all the 82 castes.
            <lb />
            The statement submitted by the State
            <lb />
            Government showing representation of various castes in
            <lb />
            services from the year 2007 to 2012 is reproduced
            <lb />
            hereunder to show that many castes are having &quot;zero&quot;
            <lb />
            representation in services, whereas, few castes are having
            <lb />
            proportionately
            <lb />
            excessive
            <lb />
            representation,
            <lb />
            yet
            <lb />
            not
            <lb />
            recommended for exclusion. It is moreso when the Apex
            <lb />
            Court has directed for exclusion of the caste, if adequately
            <lb />
            represented. The Commission has failed to discharge its
            <lb />
            obligation properly while making the report :

            The data aforesaid show no representation in
            <lb />
            services of few castes, whereas, adequate representation of
            <lb />
            other castes, yet it has been ignored by the Commission.
            <lb />
            Learned Solicitor General Mr.Ranjeet Kumar has
            <lb />
            referred the Notification dated 31 st July, 2009 to show extra
            <lb />
            ordinary situation in the State so as to bring the Act of 2008
            <lb />
            for making a new category of &quot;special backward class&quot;. A
            <lb />
            reference of Section 2H of the Act of 2008 has been given
            <lb />
            to show definition of &quot;Special Backward Class&quot;. Section 4
            <lb />
            provides reservation to various categories, which includes,
            <lb />
            Special Backward Class.
            <lb />
            Five castes brought under the umbrella of special
            <lb />
            backward classes were earlier also getting benefit of
            <lb />
            reservation for last many years. No extra ordinary situation
            <lb />
            could be given by the SBC Commission and the State
            <lb />
            Government to create a new category for five castes. The
            <lb />
            extra ordinary circumstances have been shown for sake of it
            <lb />
            and otherwise based on incomplete data. If the extra
            <lb />
            ordinary situation is due to less or negligible representation
            <lb />
            of five castes in the services as well as in educational courses,
            <lb />
            the status of other castes was not seen which are having no
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
            <lb />
            181
            <lb />
            representation. It seems that the SBC Commission was to
            <lb />
            make recommendation only for five castes out of 82, without
            <lb />
            proper justification. It is moreso when the IDS was asked to
            <lb />
            submit report for 82 castes and even the reference by the
            <lb />
            State Government was for all those castes. Why the report
            <lb />
            was submitted without complete survey, could not be
            <lb />
            explained.
            <lb />
            It was also urged by learned Solicitor General
            <lb />
            that once a decision has been taken by the Government to
            <lb />
            provide reservation to special backward classes, it should not
            <lb />
            be interfered unless shown to be with ulterior motive or
            <lb />
            enactment is unconstitutional, otherwise, wisdom of
            <lb />
            Legislature should prevail.
            <lb />
            The aforesaid has been taken into consideration
            <lb />
            by this Court.
            <lb />
            We find that reservation has been provided
            <lb />
            beyond 50 per cent having no extra ordinary situation. All the
            <lb />
            five castes were getting reservation in OBC category and it is
            <lb />
            not that the Gujjars/Gurjars and others were having no
            <lb />
            representation either for admission in the educational
            <lb />
            institutions or in services. The data has not been collected to
            <lb />
            182
            <lb />
            the extent it was required. In those circumstances,
            <lb />
            recommendation of the SBC Commission can be said to be
            <lb />
            perverse. It is otherwise without consideration for exclusion
            <lb />
            of few castes when adequate representation exists. It was
            <lb />
            expected that if one or two castes has taken major part of
            <lb />
            the reservation and, for that, other caste could not get
            <lb />
            adequate representation, then to exclude castes taken major
            <lb />
            part of reservation, so that remaining castes may get due
            <lb />
            benefit.
            <lb />
            This Court has made its observation on the report
            <lb />
            of SBC Commission on few issues, otherwise, entire report is
            <lb />
            such, on which, confidence cannot be deposed. The
            <lb />
            Commission has given reference of Kaka Kalelkar Committee
            <lb />
            report apart from many other committees in ignorance of the
            <lb />
            direction of the Apex Court to review the list every ten
            <lb />
            years. The purpose to review is not only to include but exclude
            <lb />
            those, who could get adequate representation in the services
            <lb />
            as well as educational institutions. The statement has even
            <lb />
            been prepared after taking into consideration the ratio on the
            <lb />
            total population though not permissible and otherwise, in
            <lb />
            reference to the year 1931. In view of the above, the SBC
            <lb />
            183
            <lb />
            Commission and the State Government have failed to
            <lb />
            discharge their obligation as per the directions of the Apex
            <lb />
            Court to collect quantifiable data.
            <lb />
            It has been admitted that IDS had conducted
            <lb />
            survey in urban as well as rural areas. In a district, only five
            <lb />
            villages under Panchayat Samitis were chosen and, for urban
            <lb />
            area, 13 cities and towns were selected. We need not to make
            <lb />
            further comment on it because the SBC Commission itself has
            <lb />
            made serious comments on the report of the IDS. The
            <lb />
            scientific method to conduct survey has not been adopted,
            <lb />
            though the SBC Commission thereupon relied on the report of
            <lb />
            IDS while drawing its conclusions in Chapter Ten, which
            <lb />
            remains in contradiction to their own comments on the report.
            <lb />
            Learned Solicitor General Mr.Ranjeet Kumar was
            <lb />
            fair to admit that the SBC Commission did not accept the
            <lb />
            report of IDS as it was without adopting scientific method
            <lb />
            and proportional formula. The State Government was thus
            <lb />
            asked to submit data of various castes in regard to admission
            <lb />
            in the educational institutions and appointment in the
            <lb />
            services. It was submitted thereupon but in a haste. It was
            <lb />
            for appointment in class I and II services leaving others, that
            <lb />
            184
            <lb />
            too, selection by the Rajasthan Public Service Commission
            <lb />
            though selections were conducted by many Departments itself
            <lb />
            followed by appointments but those were not taken into
            <lb />
            consideration.
            <lb />
            It is further admitted by learned counsel
            <lb />
            appearing for the State Government that IDS had shown
            <lb />
            various practical difficulties in survey. All those facts have
            <lb />
            been reflected in the reply of IDS to the Commission and has
            <lb />
            been referred by this Court in the previous paras. No survey
            <lb />
            was conducted by the SBC Commission.
            <lb />
            The backwardness of the castes has been
            <lb />
            assessed only by IDS and not by the State Government and if
            <lb />
            said assessment has been relied by the SBC Commission then
            <lb />
            it cannot be said to be proper when it was not based on
            <lb />
            scientific and proportionate basis, as commented by the
            <lb />
            Commission itself. The State Government has not conducted
            <lb />
            survey or supplied any data for percentage of backwardness
            <lb />
            of each caste.
            <lb />
            The survey regarding admission in the educational
            <lb />
            institutions and appointment in services conducted by the
            <lb />
            State Government is largely for five years, i.e., from the year
            <lb />
            CWP -1645/2016
            <lb />
            ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS

            185
            <lb />
            2007 to 2012, though the Commissioner-cum-Secretary to
            <lb />
            the Social Justice and Welfare Department had furnished
            <lb />
            figures from the year 2001 till 2012. The conclusions of the
            <lb />
            SBC Commission should have been in reference to the said
            <lb />
            period for all the castes. The consolidated table referred by
            <lb />

        The statement aforesaid reveals reservation of
        <lb />
        9613 posts for OBC and, as against aforesaid, 15278 OBC
        <lb />
        candidates could get appointment, i.e., exceeding to reserve
        <lb />
        posts meant for them. If it is taken against 49275 posts, so
        <lb />
        advertised, then OBC candidates could occupy nearly 30 per
        <lb />
        cent posts. The aforesaid fact has also been ignored by the
        <lb />
        SBC Commission while considering the statement referred to
        <lb />
        above. It seems that ignoring the adequate representation of
        <lb />
        few castes, recommendation to create a new category of
        <lb />
        &quot;special backward classes&quot; has been given to satisfy the
        <lb />
        desire of the State Government. The way, recommendations
        <lb />
        have been made, cannot be said to be based on cogent
        <lb />
        reasons.
        <lb />
        In all, 49275 appointments were made in various
        <lb />
        services since 01 st January, 2001 till 30 th September, 2012
        <lb />
        189
        <lb />
        and, out of it, 15278 posts were filled from OBC candidates,
        <lb />
        which comes to nearly 30 per cent of the total posts,
        <lb />
        whereas, reservation to the OBC category is 21 per cent. Out
        <lb />
        of 15278 appointments, 836 were of Gujjar/Gurjar caste,
        <lb />
        whereas, Jaats could get 4544 posts. The figures aforesaid
        <lb />
        shows that around 30 per cent posts have been occupied by
        <lb />
        Jaat candidates.
        <lb />
        A caste occupied around 30 per cent of the total
        <lb />
        posts of OBC category has not been considered for their
        <lb />
        exclusion so that remaining castes may get adequate share on
        <lb />
        its exclusion. If the total posts filled from four castes
        <lb />
        namely, Jaat, (4544), Ahir (Yadav) (933), Kumhar or Kumawat
        <lb />
        (Prajapati, Kumawat/Suara) (1267) and Mali/Saini/Bagwan
        <lb />
        (1669) are considered, then around 60 per cent of the posts
        <lb />
        came in their share leaving 40 per cent for all other castes in
        <lb />
        OBC category. In view of the judgment of the Apex Court,
        <lb />
        the SBC Commission was required to consider and make
        <lb />
        recommendations not only for inclusion of certain castes but
        <lb />
        should have been even for exclusion thereof. The new
        <lb />
        category has been created without extra ordinary situation
        <lb />
        because it is for those castes, which were otherwise getting
        <lb />
        CWP -1645/2016
        <lb />
        ALONG WITH OTHER PETITIONS
        <lb />
        190
        <lb />
        reservation for last many years.
        <lb />
        It is urged that the Apex Court in the case of SV
        <lb />
        Joshi (supra) held that contradiction or other irregularity in
        <lb />
        the report of the Commission should not be taken as basis to
        <lb />
        discard or annul the legislation. It is, no doubt, true that
        <lb />
        while making detailed and lengthy report, some discrepancies
        <lb />
        may occur but reference of the facts given above reveals
        <lb />
        major discrepancies and report of the SBC Commission shows
        <lb />
        contradiction and perversity. The report is not based on
        <lb />
        scientific method or quantifiable data. The Court cannot be
        <lb />
        silent spectator for the aforesaid, rather, if the
        <lb />
        discrepancies of the nature spelled out by this Court are
        <lb />
        allowed to stand then recommendations by the SBC
        <lb />
        Commission would be an empty formality only.
        <lb />
        Many parts of the report reflect comment on the
        <lb />
        survey conducted by the IDS and are reproduced hereunder
        <lb />
        to show observations of the Commission itself that in what
        <lb />
        manner, data have been collected :
        <lb />


        <p>
            &quot;In MOU it was made clear that sample
            <lb />
            survey technique would be adopted and
            <lb />
            conclusion would be drawn by applying
            <lb />
            scientific method as adopted by the
            <lb />
            191
            <lb />
            Institution. Survey would be conducted
            <lb />
            keeping in view the directions given by
            <lb />
            Hon&apos;ble Rajasthan High Court in which
            <lb />
            social
            <lb />
            backwardness,
            <lb />
            educational
            <lb />
            backwardness
            <lb />
            and
            <lb />
            inadequate
            <lb />
            representation in government services
            <lb />
            would be included. A bare perusal of the
            <lb />
            report submitted by the Institution
            <lb />
            reveals that sample of castes/classes of
            <lb />
            villages and cities was lacking scientific
            <lb />
            method and proportional formula. For
            <lb />
            sample of a caste, index of population
            <lb />
            percentage in the State was not taken
            <lb />
            into consideration. Proportional formula
            <lb />
            in village sample and urban city sample
            <lb />
            was also not taken into consideration.
            <lb />
            The institution collected primary data by
            <lb />
            conducting survey on various factors in
            <lb />
            the form of questioner. The questioner
            <lb />
            prepared by the institution is Appendix-

            <lb />
            Quantifiable data on various factor
            <lb />
            should have been collected by applying
            <lb />
            random survey method, which is
            <lb />
            scientific but in various circumstances
            <lb />
            the data have not been collected applying
            <lb />
            full random survey method but data has
            <lb />
            been collected applying purposive sample
            <lb />
            method. The result was otherwise
            <lb />
            affected.
            <lb />
            From the analysis of above study, the
            <lb />
            commission has come to the conclusion
            <lb />
            that on the basis of survey of few houses
            <lb />
            it will not be justifiable to reach at
            <lb />
            correct
            <lb />
            conclusion.

            Out
            <lb />
            of

            81
            <lb />
            castes/classes, 13 castes are those in
            <lb />
            whose matter not a single house was
            <lb />
            surveyed in city areas and 4 are those in
            <lb />
            whose matter not a single house was
            <lb />
            surveyed in village areas. 27 castes are
            <lb />
            such in whose matter only 1-10 houses
            <lb />
            have been surveyed. Out of above 27
            <lb />
            castes 16 are those in whose matter only
            <lb />
            1-10 houses have been survey in city
            <lb />
            areas and 11 castes are those in whose
            <lb />
            matter only 1-10 houses have been
            <lb />
            surveyed in village areas. 12 castes are
            <lb />
            such in whose matter only 11-20 houses
            <lb />
            have been surveyed. Out of above 12
            <lb />
            castes 8 are those in whose matter only
            <lb />
            11-20 houses have been surveyed in city
            <lb />
            areas and 4 castes are those in whose
            <lb />
            matter only 11-20 houses have been
            <lb />
            surveyed in village areas. One of the
            <lb />
            parameters adopted in survey was that
            <lb />
            193
            <lb />
            information furnished by the individual
            <lb />
            was accepted as it was without any
            <lb />
            confirmation/satisfaction. One more
            <lb />
            lacuna left was that after entering into
            <lb />
            government service the villagers who
            <lb />
            migrated to cities were neither surveyed
            <lb />
            in cities nor in villages. Correct
            <lb />
            assessment
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            representation
            <lb />
            of
            <lb />
            inhabitants of that area in government
            <lb />
            employment cannot be determined.
            <lb />
            The Commission has taken decision to call
            <lb />
            caste wise data of employees working in
            <lb />
            Government services belonging to all 81
            <lb />
            castes of Backward Classes. Member
            <lb />
            Secretary of the Commission requested
            <lb />
            to the Chief Secretary and Principal
            <lb />
            Secretary, Department of Personnel to
            <lb />
            provide
            <lb />
            data.
            <lb />
            Principal
            <lb />
            Secretary,
            <lb />
            Department of Personnel has informed
            <lb />
            the Commission that in select list only
            <lb />
            OBC is mentioned and that caste wise
            <lb />
            select list is not prepared. He informed
            <lb />
            that it was very difficult to collect
            <lb />
            caste-wise data of employees. He
            <lb />
            further informed that if efforts were
            <lb />
            being made it would take at least 6
            <lb />
            months to collect the information from
            <lb />
            194
            <lb />
            all departments of all districts. The
            <lb />
            Commission considered that aspect also
            <lb />
            decided to call caste wise and number
            <lb />
            wise data from main departments of last
            <lb />
            five years (2007-2012), such as total
            <lb />
            vacancies, vacancies reserved for OBC,
            <lb />
            selection of OBC candidates against
            <lb />
            general category candidates, total
            <lb />
            selection of OBC, information of caste of
            <lb />
            selected candidates on the basis of caste
            <lb />
            certificate submitted with application

            form or entry of caste in service book
            <lb />
            because the selection done by Rajasthan
            <lb />
            Public Service Commission during that
            <lb />
            period was on first and second class
            <lb />

            circumstances, the report of the SBC Commission cannot be

            accepted. The survey should have been conducted in the

            manner required and otherwise directed by the Apex Court in
            <lb />
            various judgments. It was expected of the Commission not to
            <lb />
            rely on the old data which are not relevant at present. The
            <lb />
            deficiencies and the perversity in the report can be

            of

            only in Class I and II services leaving others, that too,
            <lb />
            for few services out of 170 thus, data aforesaid should
            <lb />
            not have been relied in absence of complete survey and
            <lb />
            report thereupon.

            The SBC Commission has commented on the report of
            <lb />
            the IDS that survey has not been conducted in a
            <lb />
            scientific method yet, in later part, survey report has
            <lb />
            been relied.

            (iv)
            <lb />
            The SBC Commission has failed to consider that
            <lb />
            197
            <lb />
            economic criteria could not have been excluded
            <lb />
            altogether and it otherwise relied on only 8 points out
            <lb />
            of 24 given in 11 Indicators as per the report of the
            <lb />
            Mandal Commission. For the educational backwardness,
            <lb />
            only 2 points have been referred thus survey and the
            <lb />
            report does not refer to all the indicators and points
            <lb />
            before making the report.

            (v)
            <lb />
            The SBC Commission had considered 58 different
            <lb />
            courses of few colleges and few students, whereas,
            <lb />
            there are more than four lac students thus even survey
            <lb />
            for educational institutions was not properly
            <lb />
            undertaken.

            (vi)
            <lb />
            The issue of &quot;Nomadic&quot; status is again based on the old
            <lb />
            literature and papers and not based on the survey by
            <lb />
            the SBC Commission at their own.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (vii) The SBC Commission further failed to consider the
            <lb />
            effect of the reservation on efficiency of
            <lb />
            administration, though, a direction for consideration of
            <lb />
            the aforesaid issue was also given. The Commission has
            <lb />
            made comment about various castes and their
            <lb />

            198
            <lb />
            representation for which no survey exists. It is for 25
            <lb />
            castes yet report was given and seems to be in haste to
            <lb />
            fulfill the wishes, though, the Commission was expected
            <lb />
            to be independent and to draw conclusions after
            <lb />
            conducting survey of all the castes, that too, of the
            <lb />
            relevant period.

            (viii) The SBC Commission failed to consider the issue of
            <lb />
            exclusion of any caste, if adequately represented, which
            <lb />
            may be the reason that other castes could get
            <lb />
            comparatively less representation.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            The aforesaid are few issues to show perversity
            <lb />
            and the inadequacy in the report before making
            <lb />
            recommendations for reservation beyond 50 per cent, that
            <lb />
            too, after carving out a new category for those, who were
            <lb />
            already getting benefit of reservation for past many years.
            <lb />
            The extra ordinary circumstances to make out an exceptional
            <lb />
            case do not exist to provide 5 per cent reservation. The
            <lb />
            report cannot be said to be based on quantifiable data.
            <lb />
            In view of the discussion made above, the report
            <lb />
            of the SBC Commission cannot be accepted and is,
            <lb />
            199
            <lb />
            accordingly, quashed. As a consequence of the aforesaid apart
            <lb />
            from the discussion made in reference to Article 16(4B) of
            <lb />

            <lb />
