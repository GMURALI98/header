			<p>2.The Transport Commissioner,<lb/> 1/58<lb/> Writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of<lb/> India, to issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, to call for the records<lb/> of the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC), the 3 rd<lb/> Respondent in LIST-OT (Oral Test), containing the list of registration<lb/> numbers of 33 candidates prepared by the 2 nd Respondent dated<lb/> 15.07.2019 who have been provisionally admitted to the oral test for<lb/> appointment by direct recruitment to the post of Motor Vehicle<lb/> Inspector Grade-II in the Tamil Nadu Transport Subordinate Service,<lb/> 2013-2018 pursuant to Notification No.03/2018, dated 14.02.2018<lb/> issued by the 3 rd Respondent and quash the same and consequently<lb/> direct the 3 rd Respondent to call 226 candidates for oral test based on<lb/> the marks obtained by the candidates in the Written Examination<lb/> conducted on 10.06.2018 and thereafter conduct certificate verification<lb/> for direct recruitment of 113 candidates to the post of Motor Vehicle<lb/> Inspector Grade-II in the Tamil Nadu Transport Subordinate Service,<lb/> pursuant to Notification No.03/2018 issued by the 3 rd Respondent.<lb/> 2/58<lb/> The common issue that has arisen for consideration in all<lb/> the above Writ Petitions questions the process of selection that has<lb/> been adopted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission [hereinafter<lb/> referred to as &quot;TNPSC&quot;], which according to the petitioners is contrary<lb/> to the selection procedure specified in the Notification and it also<lb/> questions the selection of 32 candidates for oral test, who also suffer<lb/> from the same disqualification that has been put against<lb/> the<lb/> petitioners. The petitioners complain that they are treated differently<lb/> which has resulted in arbitrariness in the entire selection process.<lb/> 3/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> There are also Writ Petitions filed questioning certain individual<lb/> decisions taken by the TNPSC, dis-entitling the candidates to participate<lb/> further in the selection. A decision that is going to be taken by this<lb/> Court in the main issue that has been raised in majority of the Writ<lb/> Petitions, will have an impact with regard to all the candidates who<lb/> participated in the selection and therefore, this Court does not want to<lb/> go into the issue that has been raised in those Writ Petitions<lb/> independently.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.The TNPSC issued Advertisement No.489, dated<lb/> 14.02.2018, in Notification No.3/2018, inviting applications through<lb/> online mode for direct recruitment to the post of Motor Vehicle<lb/> Inspector Grade-II, coming under the Tamil Nadu Transport<lb/> Subordinate Service, to fill up 113 posts in the scale of pay of<lb/> Rs.35,900/--1,13,500/-. The last date for submission of online<lb/> applications was fixed as 13.03.2018 and the last date for submission of<lb/> attested hard copies of the documents along with printout of online<lb/> application was fixed as 25.03.2018. The date of written examination<lb/> for Paper-I and Paper-II was fixed to be held on 10.06.2018.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.The educational qualification and experience as on<lb/> 4/58<lb/> Applicants should possess the following or its equivalent<lb/> qualification and experience as on 14.02.2018 (i.e. the date of<lb/> notification):-<lb/></p>

			<p>W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> Provided that other things being equal, preference shall be given to<lb/> those who possess Post Diploma in Automobile Engineering awarded<lb/> by the State Board of Technical Education and Training, Tamil Nadu.<lb/> EXPLANATION: &quot;Automobile workshop&quot; shall mean<lb/> (A) An Automobile workshop owned by the Government or<lb/> the State Transport Corporation.<lb/> or<lb/></p>

			<p>(B) An Automobile workshop recognised or approved or<lb/> certified by the Transport Commissioner of the Director, Motor Vehicles<lb/> Maintenance Department for carrying out all kinds of repairs.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.Annexure-II specifically provided for the model format for<lb/> submitting the experience certificate. This experience certificate was<lb/> directed to be issued by the Automobile Workshop as contemplated by<lb/> the explanation to Clause 6(B) of the Notification.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.It was informed to the Court that totally about 2176<lb/> candidates applied for 113 posts of Motor Vehicle Inspector Grade-II.<lb/> Out of this, the applications of 785 candidates were rejected. Hall<lb/> tickets were issued to the remaining candidates to appear for the<lb/> 6/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 7<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> written examination.<lb/> The candidates were allowed to write the<lb/> examination subject to the verification and acceptance of the workshop<lb/> experience certificate, driving experience certificate and driving license,<lb/> by the Transport/MVMD [Motor Vehicle Maintenance Department]. This<lb/> condition is found under Clause 15 of the hall ticket that was issued to<lb/> each candidate who took the written examination.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.The Notification itself clearly stipulated the selection<lb/> procedure under Clause 10 of the Notification and the same is extracted<lb/> hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<p>10.SELECTION PROCEDURE<lb/> &quot;Selection will be made in two successive<lb/> stages i.e., (i) Written Examination and (ii) Oral Test<lb/> in the form of an interview. Final selection will be<lb/> made on the basis of total marks obtained by the<lb/> applicants at the Written Examination and the Oral<lb/> Test taken together subject to the rule of reservation<lb/> of appointments. Appearance in both the papers of<lb/> the Written Examination and Oral Test is compulsory.<lb/> Based on the marks obtained by the candidates in the<lb/> Written Examination, the tentative list of eligible<lb/> candidates for certificate verification will be<lb/> announced in the<lb/> Commission&apos;s website.<lb/> After<lb/> verification of the original certificates, the eligible<lb/> 7/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> candidates will be summoned for Oral Test following<lb/> the rule of reservation of appointments.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>7.All the writ petitioners appeared for the written<lb/> examination held on 10.06.2018. It is to be mentioned here that,<lb/> before the hall ticket was issued to the petitioners, all the applications<lb/> along with the certificates were scrutinized to ensure that the<lb/> certificates were given by the Authorised Automobile Workshops and<lb/> only thereafter, the petitioners were allowed to take the written<lb/> examination.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.It is also seen from the instructions given to the<lb/> applicants by the TNPSC that where the selection is made on the basis<lb/> of the written examination and oral test, the selection procedure will go<lb/> through three stages which are;<lb/></p>

			<p>a) Written examination<lb/> b) Certificate verification and<lb/> c) Oral test<lb/> The number of selected candidates for the oral test will be in the ratio<lb/> of 1:2. That is for 113 posts, 226 candidates will be called for oral test<lb/> by the TNPSC.<lb/></p>

			<p>8/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 9<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/></p>

			<p>9.In the present case, after the written examination was<lb/> taken by all the candidates, they were expecting them to be called for<lb/> certificate verification. However, the petitioners came to know that the<lb/> TNPSC had published on 15.07.2019, provisional list of candidates<lb/> calling for oral test which was slated to be held on 05.08.2019. The list<lb/> contained only the names of 33 candidates [later modified as 32<lb/> candidates]. The TNPSC had short listed 33 candidates for oral test and<lb/> by implication it meant that all the other applications have been<lb/> rejected. This impugned list of 33 candidates dated 15.07.2019, has<lb/> become the subject matter of controversy in these Writ Petitions.<lb/></p>

			<p>10.Heard Mrs.Nalini Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel<lb/> appearing on behalf of the petitioners, Mr.Vijay Naraynan, learned<lb/> Advocate General appearing for the Transport Commissioner, Joint<lb/> Transport Commissioners, Deputy Transport Commissioners and<lb/> respective Regional Transport Officers and Mr.V.T.Gopalan, learned<lb/> Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the TNPSC.<lb/></p>

			<p>11.The arguments on the side of the petitioners were led<lb/> by Mrs.Nalini Chidambaram, learned Senior Advocate, Mr.Venkatramani,<lb/> learned Senior Advocate, Mr.N.Subramanian, Mr.M.Ravi and Mr.Balan<lb/> 9/58<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> Haridoss. All the other learned counsel adopted the arguments.<lb/> Instead of reproducing the submissions made by each counsel, this<lb/> Court thought it fit to record the common issues that have been raised<lb/> and the same is extracted hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<p>• The TNPSC being a constitutional functionary is vested<lb/> with powers and duties under Article 320 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and among other things, one of the<lb/> most important duty that is vested on the Commission is<lb/> to conduct examination for appointments to the services<lb/> of the State and it is entrusted with the task of ensuring<lb/> the constitutional mandate as to the reservations. To<lb/> ensure the highest standards in the process, the<lb/> Commission is given the highest degree of latitude in its<lb/> operations and for that purpose, the Constitution of<lb/> India ensures the independence of the Commission.<lb/> The responsibility of the TNPSC cannot be reduced to<lb/> that of a mere recruiting agency and it is the duty of the<lb/> Public Service Commission to go through the entire<lb/> process of selection including certificate verification and<lb/> it cannot delegate this authority to anyone else.<lb/> However, in the present case, the Public Service<lb/> 10/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> Commission has completely delegated its functions to<lb/> the Transport Commissioner, Regional Transport<lb/> Commissioners and Regional Transport Officers and the<lb/> selection and rejection of candidates were based only<lb/> on the recommendation made by these authorities. In<lb/> view of the same, the entire selection requires<lb/> interference.<lb/> To substantiate this submission, the<lb/> learned counsel relied upon the judgment of the Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Supreme Court in Buddhi Nath Chaudhary and Others .V.<lb/> Abahi Kumar and Others reported in [2001 3 SCC 328].<lb/></p>

			<p>• The selection process involves a written examination,<lb/> certificate verification and oral test. The petitioners<lb/> were never called for certificate verification and their<lb/> certificates were verified behind their back without<lb/> calling for any explanation and such procedure followed<lb/> by the TNPSC is arbitrary.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The TNPSC ought to have published the results of the<lb/> written examination and thereafter called upon those<lb/> who had succeeded in the written examination for<lb/> certificate verification. However, without following this<lb/> process, the impugned provisional list of 33 candidates<lb/> 11/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> was published by calling upon them for oral test. This<lb/> procedure is contrary to the procedure provided under<lb/> the Notification and also the instructions given to the<lb/> applicants.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The only requirement that is provided under Clause 6(B)<lb/> is to submit the experience certificate from an<lb/> Automobile Workshop that is defined in the Notification<lb/> and all the petitioners have submitted their certificates<lb/> from the authorised Automobile Workshop. Inspite of<lb/> the same, the rules of the game were changed midway<lb/> and certain criteria which were not even notified, were<lb/> adopted and consequently the candidature of all the<lb/> petitioners were rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The petitioners&apos; certificates have been rejected for the<lb/> following reasons:<lb/></p>

			<item>[a] Counter signature of the authorised authority not<lb/> available in the records maintained by the Automobile<lb/> Workshop.<lb/></item>

			<item>[b] Details of ESI/PF not found.<lb/></item>

			<item>[c] Mode of payment of salary by the Automobile<lb/> Workshop not produced.<lb/> 12/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> [d] No separate driving experience provided since<lb/> Workshop experience and driving experience is for the<lb/> same period.<lb/></item>

			<item>[e] Attendance and pay register not available in the<lb/> Workshop.<lb/></item>

			<item>[f] Candidate has experience only in diesel engine fitted<lb/> Heavy Vehicles and not in petrol engines.<lb/> [g] No experience in diesel engine fitted Heavy Vehicles.<lb/> [h] No on-road/field experience and;<lb/></item>

			<p>[i] Workshop or the Firm which provided the certificate<lb/> not functioning in the given address.<lb/> All these requirements were not provided in the<lb/> Notification and the only requirement that is to be<lb/> satisfied is to submit an experience certificate from an<lb/> authorised Automobile Workshop. Adding further<lb/> qualifications/new conditions, to reject the candidature,<lb/> will tantamount to changing the rules of the game after<lb/> the process of selection had started. This goes against<lb/> the settled principles of law. To substantiate this<lb/> submission, the learned counsel relied upon the<lb/> 13/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> judgments of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in K.Manjusree<lb/> .V. State of Andhra Pradesh and Another reported in<lb/> [2008 3 SCC 512] and Tej Prakash Pathak and Others<lb/> .V. Rajasthan High Court and Others reported in [2013<lb/> 4 SCC 540].<lb/> • Even if these disqualifications are accepted for the sake<lb/> of arguments, they must be uniformly applied across the<lb/> board and accordingly, if such disqualification is found<lb/> even in the case of selected candidates, their<lb/> candidature must also be rejected. However, in the<lb/> present case, inspite of the very same disqualification<lb/> suffered by the selected candidates, they were treated<lb/> differently and selected for the oral test and therefore<lb/> the entire selection becomes arbitrary.<lb/> • Even if the respondents have the right to verify the<lb/> certificates granted by the Automobile Workshop, such<lb/> verification of certificates should not lead to adding<lb/> additional qualifications, which has actually led to<lb/> arbitrariness in the selection of candidates.<lb/></p>

			<p>• A similar selection took place in the previous years and<lb/> the very same qualification was prescribed insofar as<lb/> 14/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> the experience certificate was concerned and the<lb/> candidature was not rejected on the grounds of<lb/> deficiency found in the experience certificate and the<lb/> rejection was only due to the fact that the candidate did<lb/> not reach the cut-off marks. Therefore, the experience<lb/> certificate from the Authorised Workshop cannot be<lb/> treated differently in each selection.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The impugned provisional selection list is liable to be<lb/> quashed and the TNPSC must be directed to publish the<lb/> examination results and thereafter for those who have<lb/> qualified, certificate verification must be done<lb/> independently by calling the candidate and thereafter<lb/> the oral test must be conducted, before the final<lb/> selection.<lb/></p>

			<p>12.During the pendency of these Writ Petitions, this Court<lb/> passed an interim order on 30.07.2019, directing the TNPSC, to call the<lb/> petitioners in all the Writ Petitions for the interview/oral test which was<lb/> scheduled to take place on 05.08.2019 and to keep the results in a<lb/> sealed cover until further orders. This order was modified by a<lb/> subsequent order dated 01.08.2019, wherein, the 33 candidates, who<lb/> 15/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> were selected for the oral test were permitted to take the test on<lb/> 05.08.2019 and a direction was given not to publish the results till a<lb/> final decision is taken in these writ petitions. The matter thereafter<lb/> came up for hearing on 26.08.2019 and this Court passed the following<lb/> order:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;3. According to the learned counsels, without<lb/> publishing the tentative list of eligible candidates in their<lb/> website, the Commission has chosen to disqualify<lb/> several candidates on the basis of certificate verification<lb/> unilaterally conducted by the Transport Commissioner<lb/> and those disqualified candidates who formed part of<lb/> the resent batch of writ petitions were not permitted to<lb/> be allowed to the next stage of selection, namely, oral<lb/> test/interview. According to these learned counsels,<lb/> until the Commission notifies in the website the<lb/> tentative list of eligible candidates after the conclusion<lb/> of the written examination, these writ petitioners are<lb/> without any clue as to their eligibility or otherwise in the<lb/> written examination conducted by the Commission.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.Sri.V.T.Gopalan,<lb/> learned<lb/> Senior<lb/> Counsel<lb/> appearing for the Commission sought time for getting<lb/> instructions from the Commission and today, when the<lb/> matters were listed again for hearing, the learned Senior<lb/> counsel would submit that as consistently held by the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court of India that the marks obtained<lb/> by each of t the candidates need not be published<lb/> unless the entire selection process is over. According to<lb/> 16/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> the learned Senior Counsel by publication of individual<lb/> marks would result in multitude of litigations stalling<lb/> further process of selection and in which event, the<lb/> entire selection would get derailed midway and that<lb/> situation would not advance the public interest.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.At this, this Court confronted with the learned<lb/> Senior Counsel that as per Clause of the Notification, it<lb/> is clearly mentioned that the tentative list of eligible<lb/> candidates need to be announced in the website based<lb/> on the marks obtained by the candidates in the written<lb/> examination which clearly means that the list of eligible<lb/> candidates need to be published ot necessarily with<lb/> indication of individual marks obtained by the<lb/> candidates. The Commission having provided such a<lb/> procedure in its own Notification, cannot take a stand<lb/> that it need not publish the tentative list of eligible<lb/> candidates before calling for certificate verification sans<lb/> individual marks.<lb/> Therefore, this Court is of the<lb/> considered view that it is imperative on the part of the<lb/> Commission to publish<lb/> tentative list of eligible<lb/> candidates before certificate verification without<lb/> mentioning the marks obtained by the individual<lb/> certificate as that would, in fact, provide clarity as to the<lb/> candidates who were found to be eligible to be admitted<lb/> to the next stage of selection, namely, certificate<lb/> verification/oral test/interview. Instead of announcing<lb/> the tentative list of eligible candidates on he website,<lb/> the Commission&apos;s action in embarking on certificate<lb/> verification on the basis of advice/directives of the<lb/> Transport Commissioner is clearly not in consonance of<lb/> 17/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> the procedure contemplated in the Notification. Such<lb/> certificate verification before announcing the tentative<lb/> list of the eligible candidates is like putting the cart<lb/> before the horse. Once<lb/> a particular procedure is<lb/> contemplated in the Commission&apos;s Notification, such<lb/> procedure needs to be adhered to without any deviation<lb/> or departure from such requirement, particularly as<lb/> found in Clause 10 of the Notification.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.In the above circumstances, this Court is of the<lb/> considered view that in the interest of all concerned the<lb/> Commission is to be directed to announce the list of<lb/> eligible candidates on the basis of the marks obtained<lb/> by them in the written examination on the Commission&apos;s<lb/> website without disclosing the individual marks obtained<lb/> by each of the candidates and such procedure would<lb/> fulfill the requirement of Clause 10 of the Notification<lb/> and would also take care of preliminary objection raised<lb/> by all the learned counsels appearing for the petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.Accordingly, the Commission is directed to<lb/> publish in its website the tentative list of all eligible<lb/> candidates based on the marks obtained by them in the<lb/> written examination sans individual marks within a<lb/> period of one week from the date of receipt of a copy of<lb/> this order&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>13.The above order became a subject matter of challenge<lb/> in W.A.No.3261 of 2019 and the Hon&apos;ble Division Bench by order dated<lb/> 24.09.2019, stayed the above order. The Writ Appeal came up for final<lb/> 18/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> hearing on 22.10.2019 and the Hon&apos;ble Division Bench of this Court<lb/> passed the following order:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;4.In these circumstances, we request the<lb/> learned Single Judge to decide the writ petitions<lb/> expeditiously, after hearing all the concerned parties in<lb/> the matter.<lb/> We further direct that the effect of<lb/> paragraphs 6 and 7 of the order dated 26.08.2019 shall<lb/> not be given and status quo regarding appointment<lb/> shall be maintained till the writ petitions are disposed.<lb/> With these observations, the Writ Appeals are disposed<lb/> of&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>14.It is pursuant to the above order, all these Writ Petitions<lb/> were listed for final hearing. Even though, the Hon&apos;ble Division Bench<lb/> had ordered status quo to be maintained regarding appointment, till<lb/> the disposal of the Writ Petitions, the TNPSC proceeded to publish the<lb/> results of the 32 candidates including the marks secured by them in the<lb/> oral test. Therefore, this Court felt that any decision rendered in these<lb/> Writ Petitions will affect the rights of the 32 selected candidates and<lb/> therefore this Court by an order dated 03.12.2019 in WMP No.33127 of<lb/> 2019 in WP No. 23670 of 2019, impleaded all the 32 selected<lb/> candidates as respondents in all the Writ Petitions and they were also<lb/> heard.<lb/> 19/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> 15.The primary contention that has been raised on behalf<lb/> of the petitioners is that the TNPSC, which is a constitutional<lb/> functionary vested with the task of independently undertaking<lb/> appointments to the services of the State under Article 320 of the<lb/> Constitution of India, has abdicated its authority and has virtually<lb/> delegated its powers to the Transport Commissioner and Regional<lb/> Transport Officers and has taken their decisions to be final regarding<lb/> the selection of candidates, without any independent application of<lb/> mind.<lb/></p>

			<p>16.In order to appreciate this contention, two documents<lb/> are required to be taken note of by this Court. The first document is<lb/> the letter dated 27.09.2018, that was written by the TNPSC to the<lb/> Transport Commissioner. The relevant portions in the letter is extracted<lb/> hereunder for better appreciation.<lb/> &quot;I am directed to invite kind attention to the<lb/> reference cited, and to state that the Commission has<lb/> invited applications for direct recruitment to the post of<lb/> Motor Vehicles Inspector, Grade-II in the Tamil Nadu<lb/> Transport Subordinate Service on 14.02.2018. The date of<lb/> examination was scheduled to held on 10.06.208.F.N &amp;<lb/> A.N.<lb/> 20/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> Before the conduct of examination the Transport<lb/> Department staff had deputed to Commission&apos;s office to<lb/> scrutinize and certify the validity of driving license, driving<lb/> experience and whether the workshop in which the<lb/> candidates have experienced is approved by the Motor<lb/> Vehicle maintenance Department. Thereafter examination<lb/> was conducted on 10.06.2018 F.N.&amp; A.N. as per the<lb/> schedule.<lb/> During the scrutiny of applications it was noticed<lb/> that in certain driving license ID the previous expiry date<lb/> was not mentioned. Therefore it was not known whether<lb/> it is valid or not at the time of Notification. Those licenses<lb/> have to be verified now from the concerned Regional<lb/> Transport Officers.<lb/> Further out of 1328 appeared candidates 1324<lb/> candidates details were already been sent to the office of<lb/> Transport Commissioner on 31.08.2018 for ascertaining<lb/> the validity of the driving license, genuineness of the<lb/> experiences possessed by the candidates and getting its<lb/> approval on them.<lb/> Now the details of remaining 4 candidates<lb/> are now been sent herewith to the Office of the Transport<lb/> Commissioner to ascertain the validity of the driving<lb/> license, genuineness of the experiences possessed by the<lb/> candidates and getting its approval on them.<lb/> Moreover, it was requested to segregate the<lb/> documents district wise. Accordingly the documents of the<lb/> candidates are sorted and the CD containing the district<lb/> wise details of driving license and workshop experience of<lb/> 1328 candidates is prepared and sent herewith for your<lb/> 21/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> convenience.<lb/> I am therefore to request that a report of all the<lb/> 1328 candidates may kindly be sent to the Commission&apos;s<lb/> Office in detail with specific remarks for each candidate on<lb/> or before 22.10.2018&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>17.It is clear from the above letter that the TNPSC had<lb/> assigned the task of scrutinizing and verifying the validity of the driving<lb/> license, driving experience and genuineness of the experience certificate<lb/> possessed by the candidate as certified by the Automobile Workshop, to<lb/> the Transport Commissioner for all the 1328 candidates. The TNPSC<lb/> had called for a report from the Transport Commissioner with specific<lb/> remarks for each candidate.<lb/> This exercise undertaken by the<lb/> Commission cannot be faulted with since the TNPSC wanted to ensure<lb/> that the certificates produced by the candidates from the Automobile<lb/> Workshop are genuine and that they actually reflect the real state of<lb/> affairs of every candidate. TNPSC also did not have the<lb/> infrastructure/manpower to undertake this exercise.<lb/></p>

			<p>18.The question of delegation will arise only where the<lb/> TNPSC had entrusted its authority with another or empowered another<lb/> to act as its agent or representative. The delegation of powers will<lb/> result in another authority performing the said function. In this case,<lb/> 22/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> the TNPSC retained with itself the power of selection of candidates to<lb/> the post of Motor Vehicle Grade-II and for the purpose of taking such a<lb/> decision, it had called for a report from the Transport Commissioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>19.It will also be of relevance to take note of the directions<lb/> issued by the Transport Commissioner to the Joint Transport<lb/> Commissioners, Deputy Transport Commissioners and Regional<lb/> Transport Officers by his letter dated 30.08.2018. The said letter is<lb/> extracted hereunder:<lb/> ghh; it 2 kw; Wk; 3-y fhZk; fojj; jpy;<lb/> &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>20.The Transport Commissioner on receipt of the<lb/> requisition made by the TNPSC, in turn had directed the Joint Transport<lb/> Commissioners and Deputy Transport Commissioners including the<lb/> Regional Transport Officers to verify the certificates of the candidates<lb/> and submit the same to the Transport Commissioner. It is pursuant to<lb/> this letter, the concerned authority had scrutinized the certificates and<lb/> given their remarks in two proformas for each candidate. One proforma<lb/> pertained to the workshop experience and the second proforma<lb/> pertained to the driving experience.<lb/></p>

			<p>21.The TNPSC while publishing the provisional list of 32<lb/> candidates selected for the oral test and while rejecting the candidature<lb/> of all the others, has only taken into consideration the recommendation<lb/> 25/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> made by these authorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>22.It is at this juncture, the manner in which the authorities<lb/> had recommended or rejected the candidates and the basis on which it<lb/> was done, gains significance.<lb/> A careful scrutiny of the records<lb/> produced before this Court shows that the authority had broadly taken<lb/> the following heads to ascertain the validity of the certificate given to<lb/> each candidate by the Automobile Workshop.<lb/></p>

			<item>[a] Counter signature of the authorised authority not<lb/> available in the records maintained by the Automobile<lb/> Workshop.<lb/></item>

			<item>[b] Details of ESI/PF not found.<lb/></item>

			<item>[c] Mode of payment of salary by the Automobile<lb/> Workshop not produced.<lb/></item>

			<item>[d] No separate driving experience provided since<lb/> workshop experience and driving experience is for the<lb/> same period.<lb/></item>

			<item>[e] Attendance and pay register not available in the<lb/> workshop.<lb/></item>

			<item>[f] Candidate has experience only in diesel engine fitted<lb/> Heavy Vehicles and not in petrol engines.<lb/></item>

			<item>26/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 27<lb/></item>

			<item>W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> [g] No experience in diesel engine fitted Heavy Vehicles.<lb/> [h] No on-road/field experience and;<lb/></item>

			<item>[i] Workshop or the Firm which provide the certificate<lb/> not functioning in the given address.<lb/></item>

			<item>23.The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the<lb/> petitioners have questioned the above categories that have been<lb/> considered for the purpose of scrutiny of the certificates. It is their<lb/> contention that the above categories were not provided in the<lb/> Notification and by adding the qualifications in the name of verification,<lb/> the rules of the game have been changed midway during the selection.<lb/></item>

			<p>24.The learned Advocate General submitted that the<lb/> Automobile Workshops which issue the certificates are the ones which<lb/> are recognized/approved/certified by the Transport Commissioner or by<lb/> the Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department. Therefore, it is always<lb/> open to scrutinize/verify such certificates so as to ensure that the<lb/> candidates to whom the certificates were given satisfy the<lb/> requirements. The manner in which the verification is going to be done<lb/> need not be stated in the Notification, till there is uniformity maintained<lb/> in such scrutiny for all the candidates. The learned Advocate General<lb/> 27/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 28<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> further submitted that this will not amount to changing the rules of the<lb/> game midway in the process of appointment.<lb/></p>

			<p>25.In the present case, the eligibility criteria insofar as<lb/> experience is concerned is by way of producing a certificate from the<lb/> Automobile Workshop that has been defined in the Notification. This<lb/> eligibility criteria has not been tinkered in this case and admittedly all<lb/> the candidates have submitted the certificates issued by these<lb/> approved/recognized Automobile Workshops. As rightly contended by<lb/> the learned Advocate General, it will always be open to scrutinize/verify<lb/> the genuineness of the certificates issued by these Automobile<lb/> Workshops and it is not necessary to state in the Notification as to how<lb/> it is going to be done. This exercise is only to ensure that the<lb/> certificate given by the concerned Automobile Workshop is genuine.<lb/> This is more so considering the post that is involved in the present case.<lb/></p>

			<p>26.One important issue that has led to a total confusion in<lb/> the selection process is that what was found to be a disqualification for<lb/> a non-selected candidate, was also found for a selected candidate and<lb/> inspite of the same, 32 candidates were selected for the oral test. This<lb/> can be demonstrated with the following tabular column:<lb/> 28/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/></p>

			<p>27.It is clear from the above tabular column that whatever<lb/> was found to be a disqualification for the non selected candidate was<lb/> also equally found for the selected candidates and inspite of it, they<lb/> have been selected for the oral test and the final results have also been<lb/> published. What is sauce for a goose is a sauce for the gander. This<lb/> term is used to emphasize upon the fact that the selected and the<lb/> non-selected candidates ought to have been treated equally when it<lb/> came to identifying the criteria for disqualification. This principle<lb/> becomes very important and is required to be followed in all public<lb/> employments.<lb/></p>

			<p>28.This apparent arbitrariness was pointed out to the<lb/> learned Advocate General and this Court requested the learned<lb/> Advocate General to verify the discrepancies pointed out by this court in<lb/> the above tabular column. The learned Advocate General sought for<lb/> some time to verify the records and to get back on this issue.<lb/></p>

			<p>29.The matter was again taken up for hearing on<lb/> 08.01.2020 and this Court passed the following order:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;The learned Advocate General submitted that a<lb/> decision has been taken to conduct a fresh certificate<lb/> 39/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> verification with regard to the Workshop experience and<lb/> Driving experience of all the candidates. The learned<lb/> Advocate General further submitted that the Transport<lb/> Commissioner will formulate the guidelines for the<lb/> verification of the certificates and the same will be<lb/> placed before this Court. If this Court is satisfied with<lb/> the guidelines or if anything has to be added or deleted,<lb/> the same will be taken into consideration and a fresh<lb/> verification process will be started in order to ensure<lb/> transparency in the process of Certificate verification.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.Mr.V.T.Gopalan,<lb/> learned<lb/> Senior<lb/> Counsel<lb/> appearing on behalf of TNPSC submitted that there will<lb/> be difficulty in publishing the results with the marks of<lb/> the candidates, since it will tilt the balance during the<lb/> oral interview. This Court suggested that the provisional<lb/> list of all those candidates, who had cleared the written<lb/> examination alone can be published without indicating<lb/> the marks. If this is done, the certificate verification can<lb/> be confined only to those candidates and it need not be<lb/> done for all those, who have not cleared the written<lb/> examination. The learned Senior Counsel sought some<lb/> time to putforth the suggestion to the TNPSC and to get<lb/> back on this issue.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. Post this case on 20.01.2020 at 2.15 p.m.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>30.The matter was again taken up for hearing on<lb/> 21.01.2020 and a memo was filed by the Transport Commissioner and<lb/> the same is extracted hereunder:<lb/> 40/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> &quot;It is submitted that the above Writ<lb/> Petitions came up for hearing on 08.01.2020 before<lb/> the Hon&apos;ble High Court of Madras. Consequent to<lb/> this the Hon&apos;ble Advocate General of Tamil Nadu<lb/> has directed to evolve criteria for verifying the<lb/> genuineness of the Workshop and Driving<lb/> Experience of the candidates who have applied for<lb/> the post of Motor Vehicles Inspector Grade-II. In<lb/> pursuance of this, the following criteria may be<lb/> adhered for verification of the Workshop<lb/> Experience Certificate and Driving Experience<lb/> Certificate.<lb/></p>

			<p>1.The<lb/> Director,<lb/> Motor<lb/> Vehicles<lb/> Maintenance Department, Velachery Chennai in his<lb/> office<lb/> letter<lb/> R.No.A4/15808/2015,<lb/> dated:<lb/></p>

			<p>30.12.2016 has mentioned that in the Private<lb/> Workshops during the validity period of their<lb/> approval, any Workshop Experience certificate shall<lb/> be issued strictly as per the following guidelines.<lb/></p>

			<p>a)Before issuing the Workshop<lb/> Experience Certificate, the details of the person for<lb/> whom the certificate is required, period of training<lb/> and the reason for the issue shall be sent to the<lb/> Director, Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department<lb/> for obtaining the permission.<lb/> 41/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/></p>

			<p>b)The Workshop Experience Certificate<lb/> shall be issued only after due verification of the<lb/> above details by the Motor Vehicles Maintenance<lb/> Department and with the permission of the Motor<lb/> vehicles Maintenance Department.<lb/></p>

			<p>c)In the Workshop Experience<lb/> Certificate issued as above, the details of the<lb/> approval accorded by the Director, Motor Vehicles<lb/> Maintenance Department shall be recorded.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.Hence, it is submitted that the<lb/> Workshop Experience Certificate which were issued<lb/> after 30.12.2016 in respect of the candidates, who<lb/> had applied for the post of Motor Vehicles Inspector<lb/> Grade-II in the Tamil Nadu Public Service<lb/> Commission may be verified by the Motor Vehicles<lb/> Maintenance Department.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.It is submitted that those who have<lb/> obtained Workshop Experience Certificate prior to<lb/> 30.12.2016 and already accepted by the Tamil<lb/> Nadu Public Service Commission in the earlier<lb/> notifications may be considered.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.It is submitted that , those who have<lb/> obtained Workshop Experience Certificate prior to<lb/> 42/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 43<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> 30.12.2016, but had not applied in response to the<lb/> earlier notifications may be verified by the Motor<lb/> Vehicles Maintenance Department.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.It is submitted that the all such<lb/> cases where Workshop Experience Certificate has<lb/> been issued by the Transport Corporation<lb/> Undertakings, the Hon&apos;ble High Court of Madras<lb/> may take a decision.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.It is submitted that the verification of<lb/> Driving Experience may be entrusted to the<lb/> Transport Commissionerate.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.It is submitted that there are two<lb/> criteria available to ascertain the Driving Experience<lb/> of the candidates viz.<lb/></p>

			<p>a) Attendance<lb/> b) Pay Acquittance<lb/></p>

			<p>8.It is submitted that, in actual<lb/> practice, most of the Vehicles Owners/Fleet<lb/> Operators are not maintaining the attendance and<lb/> pay acquittance. If the above criteria are insisted,<lb/> there may be chances of producing fabricated<lb/> attendance and pay acquittance.<lb/> 43/58<lb/> Joint Transport Commissioner(Admin)<lb/> Principal Secretary /<lb/> Chennai.<lb/> Transport Commissioner<lb/> Chennai 600 005.<lb/></p>

			<p>31.Before proceeding further to consider the memo filed by<lb/> the Transport Commissioner and to issue directions in these batch of<lb/> writ petitions, this Court wishes to place on record its appreciation for<lb/> the effort taken by the learned Advocate General to persuade the<lb/> authorities and make them understand the importance of following a<lb/> transparent procedure for all the candidates and ensure purity in public<lb/> employment. This Court also appreciates the authorities who readily<lb/> accepted the advise given by the learned Advocate General and agreed<lb/> 45/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> to evolve a process which is going to be applied for all the 1328<lb/> candidates. This decision taken by the respondents has resulted in<lb/> coming to a fair conclusion in these writ petitions and in ensuring that<lb/> there is no further delay caused in the selection of candidates to the<lb/> post of Motor Vehicle Inspector Grade-II.<lb/></p>

			<p>32.The learned Advocate General submitted that as per the<lb/> letter of the Director of Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department, dated<lb/> 30.12.2016, the said department should verify the Workshop Experience<lb/> Certificate issued to the candidates, before the same is given to the<lb/> candidates by the concerned Automobile Workshop. The learned<lb/> Advocate General submitted that since the certificates have already<lb/> been issued by the concerned Automobile Workshops, the Motor<lb/> Vehicles Maintenance Department will<lb/> now verify the Workshop<lb/> Experience Certificate that has been issued to the candidates and a<lb/> report will be submitted to the TNPSC.<lb/></p>

			<p>33.The learned Advocate General further submitted that<lb/> insofar as the driving experience certificate is concerned, a self<lb/> -declaration is going to be obtained from the concerned Workshop<lb/> which gave the driving experience certificate to the candidates and the<lb/> 46/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 47<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> annexure to the memo filed before this Court gives the format of the<lb/> self-declaration.<lb/></p>

			<p>34.The learned Advocate General further submitted that<lb/> the Notification provides for a minimum of one year experience for the<lb/> candidates who should have worked with vehicles fitted with petrol<lb/> engines and diesel engines on a full time basis in an Automobile<lb/> Workshop which undertakes repairs of Light Motor Vehicles, Heavy<lb/> Goods Vehicles and Heavy Passenger Motor Vehicles. It was further<lb/> submitted that an Automobile Workshop also covers the workshop<lb/> owned by the State Transport Corporations. The State Transport<lb/> Corporations have phased out petrol engine vehicles from the year<lb/> 2003 onwards and there are no petrol engine vehicles available from<lb/> the year 2014 onwards. The learned Advocate General therefore,<lb/> submitted that the Transport Corporations cannot issue certificates<lb/> regarding experience in petrol engine vehicles after 2014 and this may<lb/> cause difficulties to the candidates for whom the workshop experience<lb/> certificates have been issued by the Transport Department. The<lb/> learned Advocate General therefore left if to the Court to pass<lb/> appropriate orders by fixing the experience criteria accordingly, so that<lb/> the candidates who got their certificates from the Transport<lb/> 47/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> Corporations are not placed in a dis-advantageous position.<lb/></p>

			<p>35.The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the<lb/> petitioners, on the whole, agreed with the memo filed by the Transport<lb/> Commissioner and the submissions made by the learned Advocate<lb/> General. However, some suggestions were made to this Court to be<lb/> taken into consideration while giving directions in these Writ Petitions.<lb/></p>

			<p>36.It was submitted that all the particulars are now<lb/> available in the TNPSC portal and the Motor Vehicles Maintenance<lb/> Department can check the authenticity of the certificate issued by the<lb/> approved Workshop without any requirement to collect further<lb/> materials. It was further submitted that the Notification provides for a<lb/> minimum of one year experience and this one year must be calculated<lb/> by ensuring that each of the candidates have worked atleast for 240<lb/> days in a given year.<lb/></p>

			<p>37.It was further submitted that while considering the<lb/> driving experience, candidates who are claiming such experience by<lb/> combining their experience both as a mechanic and as a test driver,<lb/> they must specifically state that they were also engaged as a test driver<lb/> 48/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> while working as mechanic in the Workshop. For this purpose, the full<lb/> Bench judgment of this Court in D.Vinothkumar and A.Namivenkatesh<lb/> .v. The Secretary, Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission,<lb/> Omanthurar Arasinar Thottam, Chennai-2 and Others reported in<lb/> [2009 (3) CTC 1] is relied upon and the relevant portion in the<lb/> judgment is extracted hereunder:<lb/> &quot;10. Further, when it is proved that during the<lb/> period of working in a automobile work shop<lb/> undertaking repairs of light motor vehicles, heavy goods<lb/> vehicles and heavy passenger motor vehicles, it is the<lb/> work of a person to go for test drive after the completion<lb/> of mechanical aspect of work to check-up as to whether<lb/> the mechanical work is complete, there is no reason to<lb/> take any separate experience in driving heavy motor<lb/> vehicles for a period of not less than six months during<lb/> the course of his one year period in the automobile<lb/> work shop. The word &quot;six months period&quot; found in sub-<lb/>clause (v) need not be attributed to a separate period of<lb/> six months and during the period of one year working in<lb/> the automobile work shop, if the person had experience<lb/> in driving of such heavy transport vehicle, such<lb/> experience should be taken into consideration as it<lb/> would fulfil the requirement found in Clause 5(B)(v) of<lb/> the Notification/Advertisement dated 18.04.2007,<lb/> independently.<lb/></p>

			<p>38.Mrs.Nalini Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel<lb/> 49/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 50<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> appearing on behalf of some of the petitioners submitted that the relief<lb/> that is going to be granted in these Writ Petitions must be confined only<lb/> to the writ petitioners and not for others who have remained to be<lb/> fence-sitters. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the<lb/> TNPSC must be directed to publish the results of the written<lb/> examination in accordance with Clause 10 of the Notification and the<lb/> process of verification to be done by the Motor Vehicles Maintenance<lb/> Department must be confined only to those candidates who have<lb/> qualified in the written examination.<lb/></p>

			<p>39.Mr.V.T.Gopalan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on<lb/> behalf of the TNPSC submitted that the results can be published only<lb/> after the oral test and if the same is published at this stage with the<lb/> marks, it will tilt the balance and there are possibilities of manipulations<lb/> while assigning the marks during the oral test. The learned Senior<lb/> Counsel submitted that in all cases involving oral test, the results<lb/> cannot be published at the written examination stage and the final<lb/> results of the candidates who are found to be fully eligible after the oral<lb/> test, alone can be published. For this purpose, the learned Senior<lb/> Counsel relied upon Clause 13(i) of the Notification.<lb/></p>

			<p>40.This Court has carefully considered the suggestions<lb/> 50/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> made by the respective Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<p>41.This Court finds the procedure suggested in the memo<lb/> filed by the Transport Commissioner to be reasonable. Once this<lb/> procedure is applied equally to all the candidates, there can be no<lb/> grievance. It will also ensure that the Workshop Experience Certificate<lb/> issued by the authorised Workshops is properly verified/scrutinized by<lb/> the Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department. Incidentally, it is this<lb/> department which certifies/authorises the Workshops and in the fitness<lb/> of things, the same department will now scrutinize the Workshop<lb/> Experience Certificate that was given to the candidates.<lb/></p>

			<p>42.In the considered view of this Court, the directions that<lb/> are going to be issued in these Writ Petitions should be made applicable<lb/> to all the candidates and it should not be confined only to the writ<lb/> petitioners. It is now a well settled law that where a relief of this<lb/> nature is granted, it must be made applicable to all the similarly placed<lb/> persons apart from the writ petitioners. The selection is yet to be<lb/> finalised and therefore, the relief can be made applicable to all the<lb/> candidates.<lb/></p>

			<p>43.The next question that arises for consideration is as to<lb/> 51/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 52<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> whether the verification should be confined only to those persons who<lb/> have qualified in the written examination or it should be undertaken for<lb/> all the 1328 candidates who participated in the written examination.<lb/> The respondents have taken a very specific stand that they will<lb/> scrutinize all the 1328 candidates since the records are already<lb/> available and they have the infrastructure/man power to complete this<lb/> process within a short period of time. In this case, separate marks are<lb/> assigned for the oral test and therefore it will not be proper to reveal<lb/> the marks obtained by the candidates in the written examination at this<lb/> stage. As rightly contended by the learned Senior Counsel appearing<lb/> on behalf of the TNPSC, this will tilt the balance in the final selection<lb/> and will certainly lead to arbitrary allotment of marks during the oral<lb/> test. This Court does not want to go into the interpretation of Clause<lb/> 10 and Clause 13(i) of the Notification at this stage. In the considered<lb/> view of this Court, having regard to the peculiar facts of the present<lb/> case, it will be just and proper to verify/scrutinize the certificates of all<lb/> the 1328 candidates who participated in the written examination.<lb/></p>

			<p>44.All the Writ Petitions are disposed of with the following<lb/> directions:<lb/></p>

			<p>(a) The Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department shall<lb/> 52/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> 53<lb/> W.P.Nos.22535 of 2019 &amp; batch<lb/> take up the process of verification of the Workshop Experience<lb/> Certificates issued by the approved Automobile Workshop as defined in<lb/> the explanation to Clause 6(B) of the Notification.<lb/></p>

			<p>(b) The Workshop Experience Certificates shall be<lb/> scrutinized by the Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department for all the<lb/> 1328 candidates, who participated in the written examination.<lb/></p>

			<p>(c)<lb/> The verification/scrutiny shall be done with regard to<lb/> all the Workshop Experience Certificates issued to the candidates,<lb/> irrespective of the year in which it was issued.<lb/></p>

			<p>(d) The<lb/> Automobile<lb/> Workshops<lb/> are<lb/> recognised/approved/certified only by the Motor Vehicles Maintenance<lb/> Department and therefore, the department is expected to know the<lb/> criteria/basis on which such recognition/approval/certification was<lb/> granted and the records that are supposed to be maintained by these<lb/> Workshops. The same shall be kept in mind while scrutinizing/verifying<lb/> the Workshop Experience Certificates issued to the candidates by the<lb/> concerned Workshop. The relevant records are already available and<lb/> what requires to be verified is the authenticity of the certificates issued<lb/> 53/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> by the Authorised Workshops.<lb/></p>

			<p>(e) It is open to the Motor Vehicles Maintenance<lb/> Department to get clarifications from the candidates, if so required<lb/> during the process of verification/scrutiny.<lb/></p>

			<p>(f)<lb/> The bench mark that is evolved by the Motor<lb/> Vehicles Maintenance Department shall be equally applied across the<lb/> board for all the candidates without any discrimination and this will<lb/> ensure transparency in the entire process.<lb/></p>

			<p>(g) The Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department at the<lb/> time of considering the experience of the candidates who have worked<lb/> on vehicles fitted with petrol engines and diesel engines, need not<lb/> disqualify a candidate for not possessing the experience with petrol<lb/> engines. The State Transport Corporation has already dispensed with<lb/> petrol engine run vehicles from the year 2014 onwards and therefore, it<lb/> cannot issue Work Experience Certificate for candidates who worked in<lb/> the State Transport Corporation for experience in vehicles fitted with<lb/> petrol engines. Therefore, the experience with petrol engines and/or<lb/> 54/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/> diesel engines can be taken into consideration provided the candidate<lb/> has worked for a period of not less than one year.<lb/></p>

			<p>(h) While considering the minimum period of one year,<lb/> the Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department shall ensure that each<lb/> candidate had worked atleast for 240 days days in a given year. The<lb/> Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department shall also ensure that<lb/> candidates who had worked as a mechanic and are claiming<lb/> consideration of their combined experience as a mechanic and as a<lb/> driver, have done test driving in the course of their work. The full<lb/> Bench of this Court in the judgment referred supra has clarified this<lb/> position.<lb/></p>

			<p>(i)<lb/> Insofar as the driving experience certificate is<lb/> concerned, a self-declaration shall be obtained from the person in-<lb/>charge of the Automobile Workshop in the format that has been<lb/> appended to the memo filed by the Transport Commissioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>(j)<lb/> The Motor Vehicles Maintenance Department shall<lb/> complete this process within a period of four weeks from the date of<lb/> receipt of copy of this order and submit its report to the TNPSC.<lb/></p>

			<p>55/58<lb/> https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/<lb/></p>

			<p>(k)<lb/> The TNPSC on receipt of the report from the Motor<lb/> Vehicles Maintenance Department, shall independently apply its mind as<lb/> a constitutional functionary under Article 320 of the Constitution of<lb/> India and proceed to call all the eligible candidates for the oral test. It<lb/> is also open to the TNPSC to seek clarification from the candidates in<lb/> the course of certificate verification; and<lb/></p>

			<p>(l) The TNPSC shall complete the process of final selection<lb/> within a period of four weeks after it receives a report from the Motor<lb/> Vehicles Maintenance Department and shall publish the fresh list of<lb/> selected candidates on its website. By virtue of this order, the earlier<lb/> selection list consisting of 32 candidates gets automatically effaced.<lb/> There shall be no order as to costs. Consequently, all the<lb/> connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.<lb/></p>
