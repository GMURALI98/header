            <lb />

            <lb />
            Appellants/Accused persons to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed
            <lb />
            trial.

        </p>

        <p>

            <lb />
            To substantiate its case, the prosecution examined PW-1 to PW-27
            <lb />
            and exhibited PW-Ex-1/A to PW-Ex-27/B and Ex-PA to Ex-PH before
            <lb />
            the Trial Court. On the contrary, in the defense, the Appellants/Accused

            persons examined DW-1 to DW-5.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            6.

            The Sessions Court observed that the Appellants/Accused persons
            <lb />
            did not give any plausible explanation, to counter the incriminating
            <lb />
            evidence against them, in their statements recorded under Section 313 of
            <lb />
            Cr.P.C. It was further observed that they only examined their family
            <lb />
            members in defense to falsify the statements of the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant. The Sessions Court relied upon the evidence
            <lb />
            led by the prosecution to record the finding that the Appellants/Accused
            <lb />
            persons had committed an offence of rape upon her.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>

            <lb />
            The Sessions Court held that the testimony of the Prosecutrix/
            <lb />
            Complainant, the examination of witnesses, and the material available on
            <lb />
            record has led to credible evidence to prove the guilt of the
            <lb />
            Appellants/Accused persons. It was held that the sexual assault was
            <lb />
            proved, and the Prosecution had established its case beyond reasonable
            <lb />
            doubt that the Appellants/Accused persons had committed rape on the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant.
            <lb />

            10. Mr. Summet Verma, learned counsel appearing for the Delhi High
            <lb />
            Court Legal Services Committee (DHCLSC) qua the accused Amit @
            <lb />
            Sonu Jaat, Yaseen Khan @ Tehana, Vicky @ Vijay and Lucky submitted
            <lb />
            that the Appellants/Accused persons did not commit any offence, rather
            <lb />
            they were not present on the spot and have been falsely implicated in the
            <lb />
            present case.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            11. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants/Accused
            <lb />
            persons submitted that there are several contradictions as to who was
            <lb />
            driving the car and who got the Prosecutrix/Complainant seated in the
            <lb />
            car. There are also contradictions as to from where and on whose
            <lb />
            identification
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            accused
            <lb />
            persons
            <lb />
            were
            <lb />
            arrested.
            <lb />
            The
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant (PW-1) had stated that she did not know the
            <lb />
            accused persons by their names, however the accused had been named in
            <lb />
            the complaint, which makes her statement contradictory and raises
            <lb />
            serious doubts regarding the identification statement of the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            12. The Prosecutrix/Complainant had stated that she had seen the
            <lb />
            Appellants/Accused persons in the police station but in the Examination-
            <lb />
            in-chief of the Investigation Officer (PW-21) stated that on following a
            <lb />
            tip, the accused namely Vicky @ Vijay, Lucky and Yaseen Khan @
            <lb />
            Tehana were arrested on 20 th May 2012 from Samosa Chowk, JJ Colony,
            <lb />
            Madanpur, Khadar at the instance of the Prosecutrix/Complainant. On the
            <lb />
            same day, on a secret information, other accused persons namely Uma
            <lb />
            Shanker, Satyajeet Biswas @ Satte, Abhimanyu @ Bantu and Amit @
            <lb />
            Sonu Jaat were arrested on the identification of the Prosecutrix/
            <lb />
            Complainant.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            13. It is further submitted by the learned counsel that as per the
            <lb />
            complaint (Ex.-PW-1/A), accused Vicky @ Vijay was driving the car and
            <lb />
            accused Satyajeet Biswas @ Satte committed rape on the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant but in her testimony (PW-1), the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant had categorically stated that the car was being
            <lb />
            driven by a fourth person and the accused lucky committed rape in the
            <lb />
            car. It is submitted that there is also contradiction as to how many persons
            <lb />
            were actually present in the car when the Prosecutrix/Complainant was
            <lb />
            being raped.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            14. It is submitted by the counsel appearing on behalf of the
            <lb />
            Appellants/Accused persons that in the complaint (Ex.-PW-1/A), the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant did not mention that she was shifted in the
            <lb />
            Gramin Sewa from the car and then three persons took her to a room at JJ
            <lb />
            colony where four persons were already present and the rape was
            <lb />
            committed by accused Vicky @ Vijay, Lucky, Yasin Khan @ Tehana and
            <lb />
            Satyajeet Biswas @ Satte. It is submitted that the Prosecutrix/
            <lb />
            Complainant did not even identify the accused persons correctly and she
            <lb />
            again improved her version by stating that there were five persons in the
            <lb />
            room.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            15. It is submitted by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the
            <lb />
            Appellants/Accused persons that in the complaint (Ex.-PW-1/A),
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant alleged that Vicky @ Vijay and Satte caught her
            <lb />
            hand and dragged her into the car. Vicky @ Vijay drove the car and Satte
            <lb />
            committed rape on the rear seat. Then they took her to JJ Colony in a
            <lb />
            house where Vicky @ Vijay, Tehana and Lucky committed rape upon her
            <lb />
            one by one. Vicky @ Vijay had also called Uma Shanker and Sonu Jaat
            <lb />
            who also committed rape upon her and during that period, Vicky @ Vijay
            <lb />
            also committed unnatural sex with her.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            16. It is further stated that the Prosecutrix/Complainant is inconsistent
            <lb />
            as to how many persons committed rape upon her in the room whether
            <lb />
            five or seven in number. As per the FSL report, no biological evidence
            <lb />
            was found either in the truck, car or the Gramin Sewa. It is submitted that
            <lb />
            the police arrested many drivers and showed them to the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant before arresting the Appellants/Accused
            <lb />
            persons.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            17. It is submitted by the counsel appearing on behalf of the
            <lb />
            Appellant/Accused persons that the Court below has failed to appreciate
            <lb />
            that the entire prosecution case is based upon the sole testimony of
            <lb />
            interested and police witnesses and no independent witness was examined
            <lb />
            by the prosecution to corroborate their version and prove the case beyond
            <lb />
            reasonable doubt.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            18. It is submitted by the counsel appearing on behalf of the
            <lb />
            Appellant/Accused persons that the Court below has failed to appreciate
            <lb />
            that PW-1, Prosecutrix/Complainant has alleged that the act of rape had
            <lb />
            been committed upon her by seven persons simultaneously and the co-
            <lb />
            accused Vicky @ Vijay allegedly raped her twice, but on the other hand,
            <lb />
            Dr. Richa Vasta (PW-18) has deposed in her report that the hymen of
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant was ruptured and there were no fresh injury
            <lb />
            marks in her vagina. It is highly unbelievable that no injury marks were
            <lb />
            found in the vagina of Prosecutrix/Complainant when she was raped by
            <lb />
            seven persons.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            19. It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
            <lb />
            Appellants/Accused
            <lb />
            persons
            <lb />
            that
            <lb />
            being
            <lb />
            a
            <lb />
            married
            <lb />
            lady,
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant has neither cited her husband as a witness, nor
            <lb />
            her husband was examined in the Court. Even though the Complainant
            <lb />
            being a married woman, who was outside her house throughout the night
            <lb />
            and even on the following day, her husband did not even bother to follow
            <lb />
            up on the whereabouts of his wife.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            20. It is vehemently submitted that since the Prosecution has failed to
            <lb />
            prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and as such the Court below
            <lb />
            ought to have given the benefit of doubt to the Appellants/Accused
            <lb />
            persons. Therefore, in view of the above facts and circumstances, the
            <lb />
            conviction of the Appellants/ Accused persons has to be set aside and the
            <lb />
            criminal appeal deserves to be allowed.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            21. Mr. S.B. Dandapani, learned counsel appearing for the DHCLSC
            <lb />
            qua the accused Satyajeet Biswas @ Satte submitted that he assents to the
            <lb />
            submissions made by Mr. Sumeet Verma and added that the prosecutrix
            <lb />
            had failed to identify the Appellant/Accused, and time and again she had
            <lb />
            improved her versions in the statements recorded at various stages of the
            <lb />
            trial.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            22. Mr. Karan Prakash, learned counsel appearing for the DHCLSC
            <lb />
            qua the accused Uma Shanker submitted that the Appellant/Accused was
            <lb />
            not present on the spot and has been falsely implicated in the present
            <lb />
            case. It is submitted that on the statement of the co-accused Vicky, Vinod
            <lb />
            (brother of Uma Shanker) was arrested by the police. The
            <lb />
            Appellant/Accused is a fruit vendor in Gurgaon and was called to Delhi.
            <lb />
            The Police upon his arrival arrested him and released his brother. It is
            <lb />
            submitted that version of the accused person is corroborated by the
            <lb />
            defense witness and there is no reason to disbelieve the same. It is
            <lb />
            submitted that there is doubt on the authenticity of samples collected and
            <lb />
            the DNA report.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            23. In arguendo, learned Counsels appearing on behalf of the
            <lb />
            Appellants/Accused persons relied upon the judgment passed by the
            <lb />
            Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court of India in Sonadhar v. The State of
            <lb />
            Chhattisgarh [SLP (Crl.) No. 529/2021], dated 6 th October 2021 and
            <lb />
            prayed that the Appellants/Accused Persons may be granted bail/released
            <lb />
            from jail or appeals be disposed of, since they have already undergone
            <lb />
            more than half of the sentence.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            24. Per contra, Ms. Kusum Dhalla, learned APP appearing on behalf
            <lb />
            of the State has vehemently opposed the Criminal Appeal and contended
            <lb />
            that the Appellants/Accused persons have been rightly convicted on the
            <lb />
            testimony of the Prosecutrix/Complainant and witnesses examined before
            <lb />
            the court below. The Prosecutrix/ Complainant is a victim of double gang
            <lb />
            rape. All the Accused persons are named in the FIR and have also been
            <lb />
            identified by the Prosecutrix/Complainant before the court below. It is
            <lb />
            further submitted that all the Appellants/Accused persons with a common
            <lb />
            intention and in connivance gang raped the Prosecutrix/Complainant. The
            <lb />
            commission of gang rape is evident as per the injuries found by the doctor
            <lb />
            on her body as well as on private parts.

            I normally used to go out for work at about 8 AM and used
            <lb />
            to return home at about 8/9 PM and sometime I also used to
            <lb />
            get late. I used to travel by Gramin Seva Vehicle. I cannot
            <lb />
            tell the time when I was made to inhale something in Gramin
            <lb />
            Seva but it was evening time and the sun was already set. I
            <lb />
            was acquainted with the locality of the Madanpur Khadar as
            <lb />
            I also used to pick rag there. It is correct that I was using the
            <lb />
            vehicle of accused Vicky since last one year prior to the
            <lb />
            incident. I had never met the other accused persons earlier
            <lb />
            except accused Vicky, Lucky and Satte. I saw them first time
            <lb />
            when they committed rape with me. I had identified the other
            <lb />
            accused person from their dossiers and then I came to, know
            <lb />
            their names. It is correct that I have not mentioned the fact
            <lb />
            about inhaling of some stupefying substance in the FIR.&quot;

            &quot;I am married. It is correct that I have stated to the police
            <lb />
            on 18.05.12 at about 9.00 pm I was coming from JJ Khadar
            <lb />

            <lb />
            had stated to the police that there were four persons in the
            <lb />
            car. Confronted with the statement Ex. PW l/A wherein the
            <lb />
            number of person in the car is different. When I telephoned
            <lb />
            the police, I was though conscious but perplexed. It is
            <lb />
            correct that accused persons were shown to me at police
            <lb />
            post…… The accused persons were arrested in my presence.
            <lb />

        <item>
            Ans. I pointed to a truck, parked at a place and one of the
            <lb />
            accused was arrested from the truck. I do not remember the
            <lb />
            exact places from where the accused persons were arrested.

            My statement was recorded after accused persons were
            <lb />
            apprehended. Thereafter, led them to the spot and police
            <lb />
            found my allegations as correct. It is correct that I had not
            <lb />
            stated about the number of the truck in my statement. It is
            <lb />
            correct that I had stated to the police that when I was taken
            <lb />
            to the room at JJ Colony, Khadar Madanpur, four persons
            <lb />
            were already present. Confronted with the statement Ex. PW
            <lb />
            l/A wherein it is not so recorded. It is correct that I have
            <lb />
            stated that four persons had committed rape with me in a
            <lb />
            room, however, my that statement is not correct, infact all
            <lb />
            the accused persons have committed rape upon me. I had
            <lb />
            stated to the police that fourth boy who was driving the car
            <lb />
            had made telephone and told him that they were bringing a
            <lb />
            maal. Confronted with the statement Ex. PW l/A wherein it is
            <lb />
            not so recorded. I do not remember now my mobile number
            <lb />
            which I was using at the time of incident. I cannot tell within
            <lb />
            what time the police reached the spot. There were two trucks
            <lb />
            parked near CNG station. There was not much crowd near
            <lb />
            the CNG station.&quot;

            &quot;I do not remember from where accused Satyajeet was
            <lb />
            apprehended. It is wrong to suggest that accused Satyajeet
            <lb />
            was not present at the spot or that I have taken his name at
            <lb />
            the instance of the 10. I do not remember how many accused
            <lb />
            persons were apprehended near the truck. I do not know that
            <lb />
            accused Satyajeet is suffering from some disease. It is wrong
            <lb />
            to suggest that accused Satyajeet had not committed rape
            <lb />
            upon me. I had identified the vehicles involved in the
            <lb />
            incident. I do not remember the colour of the car…… IO had
            <lb />
            conducted the inspection of the car in my presence. I do not
            <lb />
            know if the IO Had lifted anything from inside the car.&quot;

            <lb />
            reached the said place at about 12 noon by car but I
            <lb />
            do not remember the colour and its number. First they
            <lb />
            inspected the Magic vehicle. The said team comprised
            <lb />
            of 3-4 officials. I cannot say how many officials of the
            <lb />
            crime team inspected the vehicle from inside. It took
            <lb />
            about one and half hour to inspect both the vehicles.

            locked or not. I cannot tell who opened the door
            <lb />
            before the inspection. No one was there inside the

            tampered with in any manner. It has also come in the
            <lb />
            evidence of PW-24 that that so long as the exhibits remained
            <lb />

            Ans. The exhibits were tampered with and the whole story
            <lb />
            was made by the IO in connivance with the prosecutrix and
            <lb />

            Ans: It is a false case. I have been falsely implicated in this
            <lb />
            case by the IO and the prosecutnx. On the call of my mother,
            <lb />
            I reached PS Jaitpur along with my mother and a lady who
            <lb />
            is my neighbour because the police officials took my younger

            brother to the PS.

            never had any contact with the prosecutrix nor I committed
            <lb />

            Ans. It is incorrect. I myself had gone to the Police Station
            <lb />
            on a call and surrendered myself. I did not know the incident
            <lb />

            Ans: It is a false case. I was called at the Police Station.
            <lb />
            Once I had talked to Vikky, police got my number and falsely
            <lb />

            Ans: I am innocent. I knew Vikky. Once Vikky called me,

            police got my number from the mobile of Vikky and called
            <lb />

            and inquired about my son accused. Amit. At that time, the

            accused was on duty. I replied to them that he will come

            after 10 p.m. I alongwith my cousin brother Mahender Singh

            38. It is a settled legal proposition that once the statement of the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant inspires confidence and is accepted by the Court
            <lb />
            as such, the conviction can be made on the sole evidence of the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix/Complainant and no corroboration would be required, unless
            <lb />
            there are compelling reasons which necessitate the Court for
            <lb />
            corroboration of her statement. Minor contradictions or insignificant
            <lb />
            discrepancies should not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise
            <lb />
            reliable prosecution case. The testimony of Prosecutrix/Complainant has
            <lb />
            to be appreciated on the principle of preponderance of probabilities just
            <lb />
            as the testimony of any other witness. However, if the court finds it
            <lb />
            difficult to accept the version of the Prosecutrix on its face value, it may
            <lb />
            search for evidence, direct or substantial, which may lend assurance to
            <lb />
            her testimony.

            <lb />
            SCC 175, the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court has held as under: -
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;21. On an overall appreciation of the evidence of the
            <lb />
            prosecutrix and her conduct we have come to the conclusion
            <lb />
            that PW 1 is not a reliable witness. We, therefore, concur
            <lb />
            with the view of the High Court that a conviction cannot be
            <lb />
            safely based upon the evidence of the prosecutrix alone. It is
            <lb />
            no doubt true that in law the conviction of an accused on the
            <lb />
            basis of the testimony of the prosecutrix alone is
            <lb />
            permissible, but that is in a case where the evidence of the
            <lb />
            prosecutrix inspires confidence and appears to be natural
            <lb />
            and truthful. The evidence of the prosecutrix in this case is
            <lb />
            not of such quality, and there is no other evidence on record
            <lb />
            which may even lend some assurance, short of
            <lb />
            corroboration that she is making a truthful statement. We,
            <lb />
            therefore, find no reason to disagree with the finding of the
            <lb />
            High Court in an appeal against acquittal. The view taken
            <lb />
            by the High Court is a possible, reasonable view of the
            <lb />
            evidence on record and, therefore, warrants no interference.
            <lb />
            This appeal is dismissed.&quot;

            Prosecutrix is found suffering from serious infirmities and inconsistencies
            <lb />
            with other material, the Prosecutrix making deliberate improvement on

            material point with a view to rule out consent on her part and there being
            <lb />
            no injury on her person even though her version may be otherwise, no

            7. We find this statement to be contrary to the statement of

            the lady doctor who deposed that she had taken the saree
            <lb />
            from the prosecutrix and handed it over to the investigating

            officer. The doctor also does not support the prosecution
            <lb />
            story. She stated that there was no evidence of rape, no

            injury on her person and that she was a &quot;multi-persons

            means and in the context that it had been used, we assume
            <lb />
            that she was a lady having regular sexual intercourse with
            <lb />
            several persons.

            8. We also find that as per the prosecution story the
            <lb />
            appellants were missing from the village on the date that the
            <lb />
            prosecutrix also disappeared that is 7-2-1999 and though
            <lb />
            they came back to the village on 11-2-1999, the FIR had
            <lb />
            been recorded after three days although they had been

            interrogated by the investigating officer on 11-2-1999 itself.

            The very fact that the investigating officer has not been

            examined also causes prejudice to the appellants. As per the

            <lb />
            statement has to be evaluated on a par with that of an

            injured witness and if the evidence is reliable, no

            distress and humiliation to the victim but at the same time
            <lb />
            a false allegation of rape can cause equal distress,

            &quot;14. No doubt, the medical report suggests that hymen of
            <lb />
            the victim was torn and that sexual assault had occurred.
            <lb />
            The victim was aged seven years. PW 8 Dr. Jaya states that
            <lb />
            it cannot be stated whether the injuries were painful or not
            <lb />
            at the time of examining the victim. She states that there
            <lb />
            may be other reasons for hymen tearing and tearing of
            <lb />
            hymen is possible if a child is involved in the sports
            <lb />
            activities. She states that tearing of hymen is possible if a
            <lb />
            girl child is living in unhygienic condition and there is
            <lb />
            itching to her private part and if she scratches it by her own
            <lb />
            finger. She states in response to the query that the minor
            <lb />
            girl of seven years is capable of sexual intercourse. In view
            <lb />
            of this, it is not possible to confirm the finding of the
            <lb />
            Sessions Court that there was a sexual assault on the victim.

            <lb />
            In view of above, we are of the view that the oral
            <lb />
            evidence of the witnesses relied upon by the Sessions Court
            <lb />
            is untrustworthy and not of credence to hold that the offence
            <lb />
            against the accused is established. Neither the oral evidence
            <lb />
            and the medical examination report by PW 8 Dr. Jaya nor
            <lb />
            the report of the Chemical Analyzer can be relied upon to
            <lb />
            hold that the accused committed sexual assault on the minor
            <lb />
            child. The evidence on record is short of connecting the
            <lb />
            accused with the crime
            <lb />
            alleged and the possibility of
            <lb />
            falsely implicating the accused cannot be ruled out. It is,
            <lb />
            therefore, not possible for us to sustain the findings
            <lb />
            recorded by the Sessions Court holding the
            <lb />
            appellant-accused guilty of the offences charged and he is
            <lb />
            required to be acquitted for want of reliable evidence of
            <lb />
            committing an act of rape on the minor child, being in
            <lb />
            relation as niece.&quot;

            &quot;It is also well settled that a little difference in facts or
            <lb />
            additional facts may make a lot of difference in the
            <lb />
            precedential value of a decision.&quot;

            <lb />
            omissions and improvements, though little in the statement and
            <lb />
            deposition of the prosecutrix, will prejudice the Appellant&apos;s case by
            <lb />
            affirming the wrongful conviction if overlooked or unappreciated.

            47. In the case of Sadashiv Ramrao Hadbe v. State of Maharashtra,
            <lb />
            (2006) 10 SCC 92, the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court has held that in the cases
            <lb />
            where there are serious doubts regarding the sexual intercourse, the
            <lb />
            benefit of doubt has been provided upon the accused. The Hon&quot;ble
            <lb />
            Supreme Court after analysing the facts of the case, held as under:
            <lb />

            &quot;10. In the present case there were so many persons in the
            <lb />
            clinic and it is highly improbable that the appellant would
            <lb />
            have made a sexual assault on the patient who came for
            <lb />
            examination when large number of persons were present in
            <lb />
            the near vicinity. It is also highly improbable that the
            <lb />
            prosecutrix could not make any noise or get out of the room
            <lb />
            without being assaulted by the doctor as she was an able-
            <lb />
            bodied person of 20 years of age with ordinary physique.
            <lb />
            The absence of injuries on the body improbabilise the
            <lb />
            prosecution version.

            13. The Sessions Court as well as the High Court had not
            <lb />
            taken into consideration the absence of spermatozoa in the
            <lb />
            vaginal swab of the prosecutrix. It may also be noticed in
            <lb />
            the FI statement. In this case the prosecutrix had not given
            <lb />
            the full description of the incident allegedly taken place but
            <lb />
            when she was examined in court she had improved her
            <lb />
            version.

            14. On a consideration of the entire evidence in this case,
            <lb />
            we are of the view that there is a serious doubt regarding
            <lb />
            the sexual intercourse allegedly committed by the appellant
            <lb />
            on the prosecutrix. The appellant is entitled to the benefit of
            <lb />
            those doubts and we are of the view that the High Court and
            <lb />
            the Sessions Court erred in finding the appellant guilty. We
            <lb />
            set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant….&quot;

            48. The Courts while trying an accused on the charge of rape, must
            <lb />
            deal with the case with utmost sensitivity, examining the broader
            <lb />
            probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or
            <lb />
            insignificant discrepancies in the evidence of the witnesses which are not
            <lb />
            of a substantial character.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            49. However, even in rape cases, the onus is always on the prosecution
            <lb />
            to prove, affirmatively, each ingredient of the offence it seeks to
            <lb />
            establish, and such onus never shifts. It is not the duty of the defense to
            <lb />
            explain as to how and why in a rape case the victim and other witnesses
            <lb />
            have falsely implicated the accused. The prosecution case has to stand on
            <lb />
            its own legs and cannot take support from the weakness of the case from
            <lb />
            the side of the defense.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            50. It is a settled law that unless the offence of the accused is
            <lb />
            established beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of legal evidence and
            <lb />
            material on the record, he cannot be convicted for an offence. There is an
            <lb />
            initial presumption of innocence of the accused and the prosecution has to
            <lb />
            bring home the offence against the accused through reliable evidence.
            <lb />
            The accused is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt.

            51. The Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court in Tukaram v. State of

            Maharashtra, (1979) 2 SCC 143 has held as under: -
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;16. Secondly, it has to be borne in mind that the onus is
            <lb />
            always on the prosecution to prove affirmatively each
            <lb />
            ingredient of the offence it seeks to establish and that such
            <lb />
            onus never shifts. It was, therefore, incumbent on it to make
            <lb />
            out that all the ingredients of Section 375 of the Penal Code,
            <lb />
            1860 were present in the case of the sexual intercourse….&quot;

            52. In Uday v. State of Karnataka, (2003) 4 SCC 46, the Hon&quot;ble
            <lb />
            Supreme Court has held as under:-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;21. It therefore appears that the consensus of judicial
            <lb />
            opinion is in favour of the view that the consent given by the
            <lb />
            prosecutrix to sexual intercourse with a person with whom
            <lb />
            she is deeply in love on a promise that he would marry her
            <lb />
            on a later date, cannot be said to be given under a
            <lb />
            misconception of fact. A false promise is not a fact within
            <lb />
            the meaning of the Code. We are inclined to agree with this
            <lb />
            view, but we must add that there is no straitjacket formula
            <lb />
            for determining whether consent given by the prosecutrix to
            <lb />
            sexual intercourse is voluntary, or whether it is given under
            <lb />
            a misconception of fact. In the ultimate analysis, the tests
            <lb />
            laid down by the courts provide at best guidance to the
            <lb />
            judicial mind while considering a question of consent, but
            <lb />
            the court must, in each case, consider the evidence before it
            <lb />
            and the surrounding circumstances, before reaching a
            <lb />
            conclusion, because each case has its own peculiar facts
            <lb />
            which may have a bearing on the question whether the
            <lb />
            consent was voluntary, or was given under a misconception
            <lb />
            of fact. It must also weigh the evidence keeping in view the
            <lb />
            fact that the burden is on the prosecution to prove each and
            <lb />
            every ingredient of the offence, absence of consent being
            <lb />
            one of them.&quot;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            53. Thus, the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court has settled the law that the
            <lb />
            prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and cannot take
            <lb />
            support from the weaknesses of the case from the defense&quot;s side. There
            <lb />
            must be proper legal evidence and material on record to convict the
            <lb />
            accused. The conviction can be based on the sole testimony of the
            <lb />
            Prosecutrix provided it lends assurance to her testimony. However, in
            <lb />
            case the court has reason to not accept the version of the Prosecutrix on
            <lb />
            its face value, it may look for corroboration. However, once the evidence
            <lb />
            is read in its totality and the story projected by the Prosecutrix is found to
            <lb />
            be improbable, the Prosecutrix&apos;s case becomes liable to be rejected.
            <lb />

            54. In arguendo, the appellants have also placed reliance on the
            <lb />

            &quot;We thus issue the following directions:
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            a) A similar exercise be undertaken by the High Court
            <lb />
            Legal Services Committee of different High Courts so that
            <lb />
            convicts represented by legal aid Advocates do not suffer
            <lb />
            due to delay in hearing of the appeals. NALSA will
            <lb />
            circulate this order to the concerned authority and
            <lb />
            monitor the exercise to be carried on.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            b) The Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee would
            <lb />
            take up the cases of those convicts who have undergone
            <lb />
            more than half the sentence in case of fixed term sentences
            <lb />
            and examine the feasibility of filing bail applications
            <lb />
            before the High Court, while in case of &quot;life sentence&quot;
            <lb />
            cases, such an exercise may be undertaken where eight
            <lb />
            years of actual custody has been undergone.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            c) We are of the view that in fixed term sentence cases, an
            <lb />
            endeavor be made, at least as a pilot project, in these two
            <lb />
            High Courts to get in touch with the convicts and find out
            <lb />
            whether they are willing to accept their infractions and
            <lb />
            agree to disposal of the appeals on the basis of sentence
            <lb />
            undergone.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            d) A similar exercise can be undertaken even in respect of
            <lb />
            &quot;life sentence&quot; cases where the sentenced persons are
            <lb />
            entitled to remission of the remaining sentence i.e.,
            <lb />
            whether they would still like to contest the appeals or the
            <lb />
            remission of sentence would be acceptable to such of the
            <lb />
            convicts.&quot;

            55. Rape is one of the most barbaric and heinous crimes that is
            <lb />
            committed not only against the dignity of the rape-victim but also against
            <lb />
            the society at large. Dignity of every citizen is one of the basic precepts
            <lb />
            of the equality clause enshrined under Article 14 and Article 21 of the
            <lb />
            Constitution, since these provisions are the &quot;fons juris&quot; of our
            <lb />
            Constitution. These crimes are against the holy body of a woman and soul
            <lb />
            of the society. The object of the relevant penal law is to protect women
            <lb />
            from such offences and to keep alive the conscience of the society by
            <lb />
            weeding out such criminal proclivity. Hence, it is the duty of every court
            <lb />
            to award proper sentence considering the nature of the offence and the
            <lb />
            manner in which it was committed. Therefore, regard being had to the
            <lb />
            gravity of the offence, reduction of sentence without any reasonable
            <lb />
            ground would be an anathema to the very concept of rule of law, and
            <lb />
            hence in the facts of the case, no such relaxation can be granted.

            CONCLUSION

        <p>
            56. In the instant case, as already analyzed, the version of prosecutrix
            <lb />
            is ridden with contradictions, and the same wherever not backed by
            <lb />
            medical or circumstantial evidence cannot be held to be reliable.
            <lb />
            Applying the same in the case, there are two sets of accused -one against
            <lb />
            whom there is no medical evidence and the other consists of those who
            <lb />
            are implicated by the medical evidence.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            57. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the
            <lb />
            present appeals are decided in the manner as follows:
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            a. CRL.A.-692/2016, CRL.A.-897/2016 and CRL.A.-815/2016:</p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            In light of the aforesaid settled legal propositions, and their application
            <lb />
            to the facts and circumstances in the instant case, this Court is of the
            <lb />
            view that firstly, if the evidence of the prosecutrix is read and
            <lb />
            considered in totality of the circumstances, along with other evidence
            <lb />
            on record, in which the offence is alleged to have been committed, her
            <lb />
            deposition qua the accused in the aforementioned appeals is ridden
            <lb />
            with contradictions and does not inspire the confidence of this Court.
            <lb />
            Secondly, Medical Reports also do not substantiate the involvement of
            <lb />
            these Appellants/Accused persons in CRL.A.-692/2016, CRL.A.-
            <lb />
            897/2016 and CRL.A.-815/2016 respectively. Thirdly, neither the
            <lb />
            prosecution has been able to produce independent witnesses to
            <lb />
            substantiate its case. In light of the aforestated, the burden of proving
            <lb />
            the case of prosecution beyond reasonable doubt is not discharged. In
            <lb />
            such facts and circumstances, the Appellants/Accused persons, namely
            <lb />
            -Amit @ Sonu Jaat, Satyajeet Biswas @ Satte and Yasin Khan @
            <lb />
            Tehna are entitled to the benefit of doubt. Already, the accused have
            <lb />
            spent a substantial portion of their sentence and despite such glaring
            <lb />
            loopholes in the case of the prosecution, it would be travesty of justice
            <lb />
            if the accused as named above are incarcerated any further. Therefore,
            <lb />
            the impugned judgment is set aside, and the appellants/accused
            <lb />
            namely -Amit @ Sonu Jaat, Satyajeet Biswas @ Satte and Yasin
            <lb />
            Khan @ Tehna are acquitted in the present case. Let the
            <lb />
            Appellants/accused persons be released from the jail forthwith.
            <lb />
            Accordingly, the appeals bearing number CRL.A.-692/2016, CRL.A.-
            <lb />
            897/2016 and CRL.A.-815/2016 are allowed and disposed of.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            b. CRL.A.-892/2016, CRL.A.-894/2016, and CRL.A.-1053/2016:</p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            In light of the aforesaid settled legal propositions, and their application
            <lb />
            to the facts and circumstances in the instant case, as well as the
            <lb />
            appreciation of the material and evidence on record, notwithstanding
            <lb />
            the fact that there are several contradictions in the version of
            <lb />
            prosecutrix as well as lack of independent witnesses, there is sufficient
            <lb />
            material on record in form of medical evidence and forensic report
            <lb />
            that incriminate the appellants named herein. Thus, this Court is left
            <lb />
            with no other option but to conclude that the offence as alleged has
            <lb />
            been committed by the appellants and the same having been
            <lb />
            substantiated by the medical evidence, the accused as named above
            <lb />
            have been rightly convicted and sentenced by the Trial Court. Thus, in
            <lb />
            such facts and circumstances, the Appellants/Accused persons Vicky
            <lb />
            @ Vijay, Lucky, and Uma Shanker in CRL.A.-892/2016, CRL.A.-
            <lb />
            894/2016, and CRL.A.-1053/2016 respectively, are not entitled to any
            <lb />
            relief, their conviction is upheld and hence, there is no reason to
            <lb />
            interfere with the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence.
            <lb />
            Accordingly, the appeals bearing number CRL.A.-892/2016, CRL.A.-
            <lb />
            894/2016, and CRL.A.-1053/2016 are dismissed.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            58. As per the latest nominal roll, as on 24 th December 2021, accused
            <lb />
            Uma Shanker was yet to serve his remaining sentence of one month and
            <lb />
            eight days. As on date, the sentence ought to have been completed as
            <lb />
            fully served. Accordingly, the accused Uma Shanker is directed to be
            <lb />
            released as per the procedure under the Jail Manual. Other Accused
            <lb />
            persons, who have not been acquitted herein and are yet to complete their
            <lb />
            respective sentences, shall be released after serving their remaining
            <lb />
            sentence in accordance with the Jail Manual.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            59. Pending application, if any, also stands disposed of.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            60. Copy of this order be sent to Superintendent Jail for compliance.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            61. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.
