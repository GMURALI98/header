			<lb />
			From the impugned order it is clear that the

			<lb />

		</list>
		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			Neither section 51(b) of the Act nor Regulation 3
			<lb />
			(2) of the COVID-19 Regulations seem to give any
			<lb />
			power to the respondent no.2 to seal the premises.
			<lb />
			The learned Additional Advocate General fairly
			<lb />
			submits that it is so. He however, submits that
			<lb />
			perhaps the power exercised by the respondent no.2
			<lb />
			was under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal
			<lb />
			Procedure (Cr.P.C.) as at the relevant time it had in
			<lb />
			fact been imposed. He further submits that even it
			<lb />
			was so, the 2 months period contemplated in Section
			<lb />
			144 Cr.P.C. is far over and there is nothing stopping
			<lb />
			the petitioners to reopen the gym, if it is permissible.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Evidently, prima facie, the respondent no.2
			<lb />
			has not passed the impugned order under the
			<lb />
			provision of Section 144 Cr.P.C. Otherwise, the
			<lb />
			respondent no.2 would have said so in the impugned
			<lb />
			order dated 23.05.2020.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10.
			<lb />
			Mr. Chatterjee has also taken this Court to
			<lb />
			the guidelines issued by the Government of India,
			<lb />
			Ministry of Home Affairs, dated 03.08.2020, which
			<lb />
			provides that gymnasium in containment zone shall
			<lb />
			remain closed for public and only those outside
			<lb />
			containment zone will be allowed to open up and the
			<lb />
			order dated 19.06.2020 issued by the respondent no.1
			<lb />
			which provides that Gymnasiums are allowed to
			<lb />
			operate from 10.06.2020 onwards with the condition
			<lb />
			that the occupancy at any given time is only 50% of
			<lb />
			the total capacity and the timings shall be from 7.00
			<lb />
			am till 6.00 p.m.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			11.
			<lb />
			Having considered the rival submissions of
			<lb />
			the learned counsel this Court is of the view that the
			<lb />
			impugned order dated 23.05.2020 shall remain stayed
			<lb />
			till further orders. Learned Additional Advocate
			<lb />
			General is permitted to file a response to the interim
			<lb />
			application within three weeks from today. Should
			<lb />
			the respondents desire any variance of the order
			<lb />
			passed today, they are free to file their response
			<lb />
			earlier and move for appropriate orders.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			12.
			<lb />
			The operation of the gym shall, however, be
			<lb />
			subject to the rules and regulations that may be
			<lb />
			issued by the Government of India as well as the State
			<lb />
			Government from time to time to contain the spread of
			<lb />
			COVID-19 and if it is permissible. The petitioners
			<lb />
			shall strictly comply with the regulations and all
			<lb />
			norms that are required to be followed to contain the
			<lb />
			spread of COVID-19 and if they violate any of the rules
			<lb />
			or regulations issued by the Government or provisions
			<lb />
			of any applicable laws, the authorities under the law,
			<lb />
			are free to take action, as per law.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			13.
			<lb />
			The observations made in this order is
			<lb />
			solely for the purpose of deciding the interim
			<lb />
			protection sought for and shall not affect the final
			<lb />
			decision in the writ petition.
