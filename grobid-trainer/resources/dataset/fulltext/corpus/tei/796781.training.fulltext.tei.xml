			<p>THE HON&apos;BLE Mr.JUSTICE M.SUNDAR<lb/> W.P.No.21815 of 2021<lb/> and<lb/> W.M.P.Nos.23004 &amp; 23005 of 2021<lb/> Franciscan Sisters of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga,<lb/> Rep by its President,<lb/> Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India<lb/> praying to issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, calling for the<lb/> records pertaining to the impugned order dated 07.10.2015 in<lb/> C.No.Misc.PRO/2015-16, on the file of the 3 rd respondent and the<lb/> consequential Circular dated 26.10.2015 in R.C.No.23545/2014/E1 on<lb/> the file of the 5 th respondent and quash the same in respect of the catholic<lb/> nuns among the teaching and the non-teaching staff working in the<lb/> educational institutions of the petitioner educational agency, as<lb/> mentioned in the Annexure to the petition, and directing the respondents<lb/> to comply with the Circular of 2 nd respondent Central Board of Direct<lb/> Taxes dated 05.12.1977 in F.No.200/88/75-IT(AI).<lb/></p>

			<p>2/14<lb/></p>

			<p>4. The above matter came up for consideration before a Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Single Judge of this Court in a batch of matters being W.P.Nos.37565 to<lb/> 37567 of 2015 and Hon&apos;ble Single Judge in and by a elaborate order<lb/> dated 22.12.2016 held in favour of the Assessee. To be noted, Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Single Judge inter alia held that as long as institution certifies names of<lb/> staff members who are members of religious body, they would be<lb/> exempt. This matter was carried in appeal by way of an intra Court<lb/> appeal and a Hon&apos;ble Division Bench, in and by common order dated<lb/> 20.03.2019 in Writ Appeal No.391 to 402 of 2019 (reported in 2019 4<lb/> MLJ 129), reversed the order of Hon&apos;ble Single Judge and held in favour<lb/> of Revenue. The Assessees carried the matter to Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court<lb/> and this Court is informed that in the batch of petitions, the lead matter is<lb/> SLP(C) No.10456 of 2019. This batch of petitions are pending in<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court and the order made by Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court<lb/> on 02.07.2019 reads as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>4/14<lb/> factual backdrop, impugned communication dated 07.10.2015 bearing<lb/> reference C.No.Misc.PRO/2015-16 followed by Circular dated<lb/> 26.10.2015 bearing reference R.C.No.23545/2014/E1 has been assailed<lb/> in captioned matter as petitioner (4 staff to be precise) could not join the<lb/> earlier aforementioned trajectory qua legal proceedings and that has<lb/> necessitated the filing of captioned writ petition is learned senior<lb/> counsel&apos;s say.<lb/></p>

			<p>6. Ms.Hema Muralikrishnan, learned senior standing counsel<lb/> accepts notice on behalf of the respondents 1 to 3, Mr.Karthik<lb/> Ranganathan, learned senior standing counsel for Income Tax<lb/> Department accepts notice on behalf of fourth respondent and<lb/> Mr.NRR.Arun Natarajan, learned Government Advocate, (represented by<lb/> Ms.Amirta Dinakaran, learned State counsel) accepts notice on behalf of<lb/> respondents 5 to 8.<lb/></p>

			<p>7. From the narrative thus far, it becomes clear that the Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Supreme Court is in seizin of the question as to whether salaries payable<lb/> to nuns would attract TDS qua IT Act. It is also clear that Hon&apos;ble<lb/> 10/14<lb/> W.P.No.21815 of 2021<lb/> and W.M.P.Nos.23004 &amp; 23005 of 2021<lb/> Supreme Court has made an interim order of status quo with regard to<lb/> payment of tax. Tobe noted, this Court is informed (without any<lb/> disputation or disagreement) that the aforementioned interim order made<lb/> by Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court is now operating and Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court<lb/> is in seizin of the main issue.<lb/></p>

			<p>8. In the light of the narrow compass with the consent of all the<lb/> aforementioned learned senior counsel and State counsel, the captioned<lb/> main writ petition was taken up. There is no disputation or disagreement<lb/> before this Court that aforementioned SLP i.e., lead SLP and all the<lb/> connected SLPs are pending in the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court and Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Supreme Court is in the seizen of these matters. Likewise, there is no<lb/> disputation or disagreement that aforementioned interim order made by<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court on 02.07.2019 is still operating. This takes us to<lb/> a scenario wherein the parties i.e., assessee as well as Revenue/State<lb/> should await outcome or await verdict of Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court on this<lb/> issue. There is no disputation or disagreement that the parties have to<lb/> await outcome i.e., verdict of Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>11/14<lb/> W.P.No.21815 of 2021<lb/> and W.M.P.Nos.23004 &amp; 23005 of 2021<lb/></p>

			<p>9. Therefore, captioned writ petition is disposed of holding that the<lb/> impugned communication dated 07.10.2015 bearing reference<lb/> No.Rc.No.23545/2014/E1 and circular dated 26.10.2015 issued by fifth<lb/> respondent will be kept in abeyance and there will be an interim order on<lb/> the same lines as made by Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court i.e., order of status<lb/> quo with regard to payment of tax as of today.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. Though obvious, whether the impugned communication and<lb/> circular get resuscitated or concluded by being set aside will depend on<lb/> the verdict that Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court returns.<lb/></p>

			<p>11. Though obvious, it is made clear that this Court has not<lb/> expressed any opinion or view on the merits of the matter and the<lb/> captioned writ petition is disposed of solely on the basis that Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Supreme Court is in seizin of the matter, interim order made by Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Supreme Court is operating and the parties should await the verdict of<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court. There are four staff members who could not<lb/> join the proceedings which are now pending in the Hon&apos;ble Supreme<lb/> Court that has led to the present scenario as already alluded to supra in<lb/> this order.<lb/></p>

			<p>12/14<lb/> W.P.No.21815 of 2021<lb/> and W.M.P.Nos.23004 &amp; 23005 of 2021<lb/></p>

			<p>12. Captioned writ petition disposed of in the aforesaid manner<lb/> with the aforesaid directives. Though obvious, it is made clear that this<lb/> arrangement (status quo with regard to payment of tax) and<lb/> notice/circular being kept in abeyance will operate till the disposal of<lb/> matter by Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court. Consequently, connected<lb/> WMP.Nos.23004 &amp; 23005 of 2021 are also disposed of as closed. There<lb/> shall be no order as to costs.<lb/></p>
