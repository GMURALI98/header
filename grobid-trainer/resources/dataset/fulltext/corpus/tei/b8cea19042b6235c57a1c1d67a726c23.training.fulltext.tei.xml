			The Appellant was sent up for trial before the

			Special Judge, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, East
			<lb />
			and North Sikkim at Gangtok, for having allegedly
			<lb />
			committed offences under Sections 13(1)(e) read with
			<lb />
			Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (in
			<lb />
			short &quot;PC Act, 1988&quot;) corresponding to Section 5(1)(e)
			<lb />
			read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
			<lb />
			1947 (in short &quot;PC Act, 1947&quot;).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			Based on an information, Sikkim Vigilance Police
			<lb />
			Station registered a Regular Case No.RC-11/2004 under
			<lb />
			the aforesaid Sections suo moto and investigation taken
			<lb />
			up.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			At the end of the investigation, the Appellant
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			found
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			have
			<lb />
			accumulated
			<lb />
			assets
			<lb />
			worth
			<lb />
			Rs.40,04,753.87 by misusing his official position during
			<lb />
			the check period being January, 1978 to December, 2004,
			<lb />
			which was found to be disproportionate to his known
			<lb />
			sources of income. The assets were either in the form of
			<lb />
			multi-storeyed RCC buildings or landed properties or
			<lb />
			movable properties, etc., the
			<lb />
			details of which are
			<lb />
			provided in &quot;Statement B&quot; to the charge-sheet against his
			<lb />
			income at the beginning of the check period, i.e., January,
			<lb />
			1978, as set out in &quot;Statement A&quot;, considered in the light
			<lb />
			of the income earned by the Appellant during the check
			<lb />
			period contained in &quot;Statement C&quot; and the expenditure
			<lb />
			during that period as described in &quot;Statement D&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			Later, a supplementary charge-sheet was filed
			<lb />
			by which the Statements A, B, C and D, were revised
			<lb />
			modifying the disproportionate assets to a reduced value
			<lb />
			of Rs.28,39,204.00 This, of course, was again revised to
			<lb />
			Rs.30,54,328.05 during the final arguments, on account of
			<lb />
			the corrections carried out on the calculation error
			<lb />
			detected in the charge-sheet.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			Charge having been framed under the above
			<lb />
			provisions to which the Appellant pleaded not guilty, trial
			<lb />
			commenced against him before the Special Court, during
			<lb />
			which 69 witnesses including the Investigating Officer (in
			<lb />
			short &quot;I.O.&quot;) were examined, apart from the prosecution
			<lb />
			exhibiting a large number of documents in support of their
			<lb />
			case. On the conclusion of the trial, the Special Judge by
			<lb />
			the impugned judgment dated 31-12-2012, found the
			<lb />
			Appellant guilty and accordingly sentenced him to undergo
			<lb />
			simple imprisonment for 2 years and a fine of Rs.10,000/-
			<lb />
			under the aforesaid Sections and to undergo further
			<lb />
			simple imprisonment of 6 months in default of payment of
			<lb />
			the fine. It is against this that the present Appeal is
			<lb />
			preferred.

		<item>
			(vii)

			were not produced during the investigation.

			That there were grave errors in the method of

			assessment and valuation of the buildings.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			That there were errors in the application of the
			<lb />
			Schedule of Rates (in short &quot;SORs&quot;) in valuing the
			<lb />
			buildings and of the electrifications carried out in
			<lb />
			those buildings and the valuation could not be

			believed for failure on the part of the prosecution to
			<lb />
			bring on record the SORs said to have been applied
			<lb />
			for the purpose of the valuations.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xii)
			<lb />
			That while arriving at the value of the buildings

			Appellant and that this aspect has been dealt with
			<lb />
			most casually in paragraph 31 of the judgment.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xiv)
			<lb />
			That when admittedly the measurement of the

			buildings were taken in the year 2005 the extent of
			<lb />
			construction of those buildings at the end of the
			<lb />
			check period, i.e., 01-12-2004, ought to have been

			verified and due weightage given therefor but, the

			Learned Trial Court has failed to do so.

			the Engineers, which is impermissible in law.

		</item>

		<item>
			(xvi)
			<lb />
			That the &quot;SORs&quot; applied for arriving at the valuation

			<lb />
			Relying upon the decision of this Court in Padam
			<lb />
			Lall Gurung vs. State of Sikkim : 2011 Sikkim Law
			<lb />
			Journal Part II 69, it was his submission that the very
			<lb />
			valuations of these buildings said to have been assessed
			<lb />
			by P.Ws 3, 31, 55, 62 and 68 were unreliable, firstly for
			<lb />
			the reason that the SORs alleged to have been applied for
			<lb />
			the purpose carried out, were neither filed by the
			<lb />
			prosecution nor produced before the Court, resulting in the
			<lb />
			Appellant being deprived of an opportunity of finding out
			<lb />
			the correctness of the valuations and also of being assured
			<lb />
			of the existence of such SORs which was in dispute.
			<lb />
			Secondly, when admittedly the four buildings were
			<lb />
			constructed in different years, i.e., 1978, 1981, 1988 and
			<lb />
			1994, then either the SORs of those years had to be
			<lb />
			applied or resort had to be taken on the &quot;depreciation&quot;
			<lb />
			method in order to arrive at their valuations. But, the
			<lb />
			prosecution has failed to prove its assertion that they had
			<lb />
			applied the &quot;depreciation&quot; method for valuation of those
			<lb />
			buildings.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11.
			<lb />
			The valuation of the four buildings were also
			<lb />
			unreliable as admittedly the blue print plans of those
			<lb />
			buildings were not seized and applied for the valuations
			<lb />
			and that many of the items were assessed based on
			<lb />
			&apos;assumption&apos; which is impermissible in fixing criminal
			<lb />
			liability against the Appellant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12.
			<lb />
			The prosecution has failed to disclose as to who
			<lb />
			during the investigation had prepared the plans and
			<lb />
			specification based upon which the valuation of the
			<lb />
			buildings were arrived at, thereby rendering unreliable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13.
			<lb />
			That the Appellant having been deprived of the
			<lb />
			benefit of notional profit of 10% suffered consequential
			<lb />
			deprivation of reduction of Rs.3,24,068/-against the total
			<lb />
			valuation of the four buildings assessed at Rs.32,40,686/-.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14.
			<lb />
			It was next contended that a sum of
			<lb />
			Rs.17,169/-ought to have been deducted against the
			<lb />
			electricity bills, Exhibit 138, as it relates to May, 1994 to
			<lb />
			March, 2005 which is beyond the check period. Seizure of
			<lb />
			the items valued at Rs.10,85,551/-vide Exhibit 1 was also
			<lb />
			seriously contested, there being contradictions and
			<lb />
			inconsistencies in the evidence of PW-1 as regards the
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			basis of valuation, in as much as, it was not clear as to
			<lb />
			whether those articles were valued as per the cash memos
			<lb />
			which were seized or at the whims of the Police Officer and
			<lb />
			that there was doubt as to the correctness of the
			<lb />
			valuations, as the Police Officers who had valued the items
			<lb />
			were not trained valuers and also that the year of
			<lb />
			acquisition of each of those items were not known. These,
			<lb />
			as per the Learned Senior Counsel, were also corroborated
			<lb />
			by PW-2 who did not know the correctness of the entries
			<lb />
			in Exhibits 1 and 2. Quite to the contrary, as per Mr.
			<lb />
			Moulik, it is in the evidence of the I.O., PW-69 that except
			<lb />
			for a few, value of most of the articles were provided by
			<lb />
			the Appellant and of the rest, it was fixed in consultation
			<lb />
			with the witnesses during the search. Apart from these,
			<lb />
			there are conflicting evidence on the question as to
			<lb />
			whether much of those items were purchased by
			<lb />
			Appellant&apos;s son PW-15, or by his sister or his mother, DW-
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.
			<lb />
			Referring to and relying upon State Inspector of
			<lb />
			Police, Vishakkapatnam vs. Surya Sankaram Karri :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(2006) 7 SCC 172, it was submitted that the prosecution
			<lb />
			has withheld the cash memos admittedly seized during the
			<lb />
			investigation, giving rise to a reasonable suspicion as
			<lb />
			regards its correctness which also called for an adverse
			<lb />
			presumption being drawn against them. That in any case,
			<lb />
			the inventory prepared on the basis of the statement of
			<lb />
			witnesses and the Appellant, would be hit by Section
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. as laid down in State (Delhi Administration) vs.
			<lb />
			Laxman Kumar and Others : (1985) 4 SCC
			<lb />
			(paragraph 41). The value inventory estimated at
			<lb />
			Rs.10,85,551/-, therefore, cannot be taken as reliable and
			<lb />
			was liable to be rejected as such.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.
			<lb />
			The search memo pertaining to the inventory
			<lb />
			was also assailed, as P.W.2 in his evidence has denied that
			<lb />
			it was prepared in his presence as claimed by the
			<lb />
			prosecution and that he had signed on it without knowing
			<lb />
			the correctness of the entries made therein.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.
			<lb />
			With regard to income from house rent, relying
			<lb />
			upon the evidence of P.Ws 40, 41, 43, 44, 45 and 56, it
			<lb />
			was submitted that it stood established that Mrs. Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba, the wife of the Appellant, had generated a total
			<lb />
			income of Rs.32,27,540/-from her building at Arithang,
			<lb />
			Gangtok during the check period. Similarly, from her
			<lb />
			building at Jorethang, West Sikkim also she had earned
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			Rs.36,000/-for the period January, 2002 to December,
			<lb />
			2004, i.e., 36 months @ Rs.1000/-per month thereby
			<lb />
			earning Rs.32,63,540/-as total rental income from those
			<lb />
			buildings.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.
			<lb />
			It was next contended that three tenants in the
			<lb />
			Arithang building by affidavits duly sworn by them had
			<lb />
			declared that they had paid to Mrs. Dikila Subba, the wife
			<lb />
			of the Appellant, rental of Rs.1,29,600/-, Rs.2,24,400/-
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			Rs.1,44,000/-
			<lb />
			respectively
			<lb />
			amounting
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			Rs.4,98,000/-in total.
			<lb />
			Although the affidavits were
			<lb />
			handed over to the I.O., he did not take those into
			<lb />
			account on the untenable ground that those were just
			<lb />
			orally sworn documents.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.
			<lb />
			The denial of the benefit of rental income from
			<lb />
			Mandaar Lodge at Development Area, Gangtok, for the
			<lb />
			period 01-09-2001 to 31-08-2004 was uncalled for in view
			<lb />
			of the evidence of Nirmal Dutta, D.W.4, that he had made
			<lb />
			the payment on the basis of a lease deed dated 01-09-
			<lb />
			2001, Exhibit D10, executed between him and Mrs. Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba, wife of the Appellant, thus being denied of the
			<lb />
			benefit of Rs.10,33,333.33.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.
			<lb />
			The next was the rental income earned by Smt.
			<lb />
			Subba from the very building at Development Area
			<lb />
			housing Mandaar Lodge, which had been taken over on
			<lb />
			lease by the West Bengal Tourism Development
			<lb />
			Corporation Limited (in short &quot;WBTDC&quot;) against a lease
			<lb />
			deed dated 10-09-1993, Exhibit 217, for the period
			<lb />
			between September, 1993 to August, 2001, on payment
			<lb />
			of additional charge of Rs.1,800/-per month as
			<lb />
			maintenance expenditure and Rs.1,200/-per month for
			<lb />
			satellite receiver system in addition to the lease rent.
			<lb />
			Although the total rental income of Rs.13,92,300/-as per
			<lb />
			Exhibit 217 was allowed by the Court, it fell in error in
			<lb />
			refusing to accept an additional rent of Rs.2,31,000/-
			<lb />
			towards provision of satellite receiver system and its
			<lb />
			maintenance which taken together would have amounted
			<lb />
			to Rs.16,23,300/-.

			<lb />
			It was then submitted that, as would be evident

			<lb />
			received from the Demonstration Officer, C.F.N.E.U. under

			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			Unit, Arithang Road, Gangtok, the wife of the Appellant
			<lb />
			had earned the following rental incomes:-
			<lb />

			(i) From 01-07-1986 to 30-06-1991, i.e., 5 years

			<lb />
			Rs. 67,600/-
			<lb />
			Total
			<lb />
			Rs.1,04,200/-
		</table>
		<lb />
		<p>
			Although the above is an admitted position as would
			<lb />
			appear in the cross-examination of the I.O., it was not
			<lb />
			accepted by the Learned Special Judge.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			22.
			<lb />
			Referring to the Annual Property Report, Exhibit
			<lb />
			37 comprising of Exhibits 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36 and the
			<lb />
			deposition of the I.O., it was submitted that it was an
			<lb />
			admitted position that the Annual Property Reports from
			<lb />
			the inception of service of the Appellant to the year 1997-
			<lb />
			98 had not been seized. As per the Learned Senior
			<lb />
			Counsel, the Annual Property Reports commencing from
			<lb />
			the year 1998 to 2002-03, which again was admitted to be
			<lb />
			correct, clearly reflect at serial no.3 that the wife of the
			<lb />
			Appellant had been earning monthly rental income of
			<lb />
			Rs.17,000/-from that property at Development Area
			<lb />
			occupied by the WBTDC for the entire period commencing
			<lb />
			from the year 1989 being the year of its construction. In
			<lb />
			support of this contention, reliance was placed upon
			<lb />
			Exhibit 217 and the lease agreement appended thereto, as
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			per which the rental income between the period 01-01-
			<lb />
			1989 to 31-08-1993, i.e., 57 months @ 17,000/-per
			<lb />
			month amounted to Rs.9,69,000/-.
			<lb />
		</p>

			supplementary charge-sheet, the Learned Special Judge in

			the impugned judgment had allowed an enhanced sum of

			<lb />
			However, as per the Learned Senior

			<lb />
			Next was as regards the income of the wife of
			<lb />
			the Appellant, Smt. Dikila Subba, who claimed that she
			<lb />
			had independent income of her own from her business.
			<lb />
			This, as per the Learned Senior Counsel, stands
			<lb />
			established when it has come in the evidence of PW-3 and
			<lb />
			PW-15 that the wife of the Appellant was engaged in
			<lb />
			the business of supply of milk, contract works
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			and hotel business and that she belonged to a well to do
			<lb />
			family and that she also used to run business of hotel,
			<lb />
			namely, Asia Lodge, Meridian at Zero Point, Hotel Reverie
			<lb />
			at Pani House, Hotel Mandaar at Development Area and
			<lb />
			was a producer of &quot;Tshangu&quot; film.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			26.
			<lb />
			Relying upon the case of DSP, Chennai vs. K.
			<lb />
			Inbasagaran : (2006) 1 SCC 420, it was submitted that
			<lb />
			where independent income of the wife stands established,
			<lb />
			it is not permissible to tag it with the income of her
			<lb />
			husband to hold him guilty.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			27.
			<lb />
			It is urged on the strength of both the
			<lb />
			prosecution as well as the defence witnesses, it stands
			<lb />
			established that the four buildings situated at Pani House,
			<lb />
			Development Area, Arithang and Sichey, are the self
			<lb />
			acquired properties of the wife of the Appellant that stand
			<lb />
			recorded in her name.
			<lb />
			The Pani House building
			<lb />
			constructed in 1978, in which Hotel Reverie is being run,
			<lb />
			was purchased by the wife of the Appellant through a
			<lb />
			registered deed of Sale for a consideration value of
			<lb />
			Rs.11,000/-paid by the brother of the wife, D.W.1. That
			<lb />
			it has come in the evidence of D.W.1 that by Exhibit D7
			<lb />
			which is a &apos;daijo&apos; (gift in marriage) document, the wife of
			<lb />
			the Appellant had received Rs.17,500/-in cash, jewellery
			<lb />
			and 240 mounds of cardamom valued at Rs.1,20,000/-
			<lb />
			and also Rs.5,00,000/-against her share of property in
			<lb />
			the family partition. Apart from this, she also had earned
			<lb />
			income from her business of running Asia Lodge and Hotel
			<lb />
			Meridian. That she had sufficient fund of her own to
			<lb />
			construct the buildings and had no need to seek financial
			<lb />
			assistance from her husband. That she is an income tax
			<lb />
			assessee and held trade licences for Hotel Reverie, Exhibit
			<lb />
			44 and Hotel Mandaar Lodge, Exhibit 45 as proprietor and
			<lb />
			assessed
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			proprietorship
			<lb />
			business
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			stands
			<lb />
			substantiated by her tax returns proved by the
			<lb />
			prosecution witnesses. The site at Development Area
			<lb />
			upon which the building housing the Hotel Mandaar Lodge
			<lb />
			was constructed was allotted to her by the government in
			<lb />
			the year 1988 vide Allotment Order, Exhibit 40, thereby
			<lb />
			clearly establishing that the property is her self-acquired
			<lb />
			property. The land upon which the Arithang building and
			<lb />
			Sichey building are constructed, were also purchased by
			<lb />
			her as would be evident from the Sale Deed documents,
			<lb />
			Exhibits 60 and 71 respectively.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			28.
			<lb />
			Additionally, it is urged that it is in the evidence
			<lb />
			of Topden Phintso Bhutia, D.W.3 that vide Exhibit D9 Smt.
			<lb />
			Dikila Subba had received Rs.5,00,000/-from him as loan
			<lb />
			in two instalments, a fact which has been confirmed by
			<lb />
			her in her evidence as D.W.2.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			29.
			<lb />
			The factum of Smt. Dikila Subba being in
			<lb />
			possession of the aforesaid properties was in the
			<lb />
			knowledge of the I.O., P.W.69, as is evident from Exhibit
			<lb />
			D2 consisting of 9 pages which he admittedly received
			<lb />
			from the Appellant.
			<lb />
			It was, thus submitted that in
			<lb />
			addition to her rental income the wife of the Appellant had
			<lb />
			the following income:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<table>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Against her 'daijo' Exhibit D7
			<lb />
			Rs. 8,07,000/-
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Against loan document Exhibit
			<lb />
			D9 taken from Topden Phintso
			<lb />
			Bhutia, D.W.3
			<lb />
			Rs. 5,00,000/-
			<lb />
			Total
			<lb />
			Rs.13,07,000/-
		</table>

		<p>
			30.
			<lb />
			Mr. Moulik further went on to submit that there
			<lb />
			were other incomes earned by the wife of the Appellant,
			<lb />
			Smt. Dikila Subba, the major portion of which were from
			<lb />
			her business. It is stated that in the charge-sheet the
			<lb />
			turnover in respect of Hotel Reverie at Pani House has
			<lb />
			been indicated as Rs.9,58,333/-for the period falling
			<lb />
			(i) Against her &apos;daijo&apos; Exhibit D7
			<lb />
			Rs. 8,07,000/-
			<lb />
			(ii) Against loan document Exhibit
			<lb />
			D9 taken from Topden Phintso
			<lb />
			Bhutia, D.W.3
			<lb />
			Rs. 5,00,000/-
			<lb />
			Total
			<lb />
			Rs.13,07,000/-
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			within the check period, for which, as per the I.O., P.W.69,
			<lb />
			records were available in the form of Exhibits 43 and 44.
			<lb />
			However, Mr. Moulik submits that these Exhibits only
			<lb />
			pertain to the turnover of the hotel for the Accounting
			<lb />
			Years 2000-01 to 2003-04 amounting to Rs.9,34,500/-
			<lb />
			and contrary to the evidence of the I.O., records were
			<lb />
			available for the other years, as is evident from Exhibit 5,
			<lb />
			which in fact showed the turnover for the period 1997-98
			<lb />
			to 2004-05.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31.
			<lb />
			The Learned Senior Counsel, further submits
			<lb />
			that, Exhibit D5 which is a certificate issued by the Joint
			<lb />
			Secretary -II, Income Tax under the Income and
			<lb />
			Commercial Tax Division, Government of Sikkim, reflects
			<lb />
			the turnover of the hotel for the accounting years 1997-98
			<lb />
			to 2004-05 as Rs.20,12,333/-which includes the turnover
			<lb />
			for the accounting year 2000-01 to 2003-04 amounting to
			<lb />
			Rs.9,34,500/-set out by the I.O., thereby depriving Smt.
			<lb />
			Dikila Subba of an income of Rs.10,77,833/-(Rs.20,12,333.00
			<lb />
			̶ Rs.9,34,500.00).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			32.
			<lb />
			It was then contended that the prosecution has
			<lb />
			committed an error in discarding the entire amount of the
			<lb />
			GPF withdrawn by the Appellant and the arrear of salary
			<lb />
			received by him during his service tenure. By referring to
			<lb />
			the evidence of PW-34, it was submitted that he has been
			<lb />
			deprived of an additional amount of Rs.7,80,282/-against
			<lb />
			the GPF withdrawal which has been wrongly indicated as
			<lb />
			only Rs.1,62,100/-when it ought to have been
			<lb />
			Rs.9,42,282/-.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			33.
			<lb />
			Similarly, the arrears of salary of Rs.2,60,553/-
			<lb />
			drawn by the Appellant ought to have been considered as
			<lb />
			an additional income instead of being disallowed by the
			<lb />
			Learned Special Judge. A bare look at Exhibit 224, which
			<lb />
			is a certificate issued by the PHE Department, under
			<lb />
			which the Appellant had served, as per the Learned
			<lb />
			Counsel, would show that arrears of salary was not
			<lb />
			included as a component of the monthly salary drawn by
			<lb />
			him and, therefore, the Learned Special Judge had fallen
			<lb />
			in error in holding so. It is then submitted that the
			<lb />
			charge-sheet and impugned judgment overlook certain
			<lb />
			other incomes of the Appellant which are briefly set out
			<lb />
			below:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(a)
			<lb />
			Rs.50,000/-as the value of land inherited by the
			<lb />
			Appellant situated at Singhithang the existence of
			<lb />
			which stand established by the documentary
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			evidence, Exhibit 32, Exhibit 46 and Exhibit 235.
			<lb />
			Exhibit 235 dated 18-08-1975 indicates that the
			<lb />
			father of the Appellant was not living when he
			<lb />
			inherited this land before the check period, a fact
			<lb />
			which adds credence to the case of the Appellant
			<lb />
			of him having inherited the land before the check
			<lb />
			period.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			It is further the submission of the Learned Senior
			<lb />
			Counsel, that the Appellant having inherited the
			<lb />
			land in 1975, he ought to have been given the
			<lb />
			benefit of the income earned therefrom, for the
			<lb />
			period 1975 to 1983, falling before the check
			<lb />
			period @ Rs.1,380/-as assessed by the
			<lb />
			prosecution which would amount to Rs.12,420/-
			<lb />
			(Rs.1,380/-x 9 years).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c)
			<lb />
			He also ought to have been given the benefit of
			<lb />
			the income earned by his wife Smt. Dikila Subba
			<lb />
			from the assets vide Exhibit D7 amounting to
			<lb />
			Rs.8,07,000/-and Rs.5,00,000/-vide Exhibit D9
			<lb />
			which in total would amount to Rs.13,07,000/-and
			<lb />
			also two additional amounts of Rs.1,32,000/-and
			<lb />
			Rs.1,75,000/-. Resultantly the value of the assets
			<lb />
			held by the Appellant at the beginning of the check
			<lb />
			period ought to have been Rs.16,76,420/-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(Rs.50,000/-+ Rs.12,420/-+
			<lb />
			Rs.13,07,000/-
			<lb />
			+
			<lb />
			Rs.1,32,000/-+ Rs.1,75,000/-).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			34.
			<lb />
			As regards the assets at the close of check
			<lb />
			period, Mr. Moulik submits that the valuation of the
			<lb />
			buildings and electrical fittings accepted by the Learned
			<lb />
			Special Judge, amounting to Rs.35,65,329/-, are liable to
			<lb />
			be discarded and expunged from the record, in view of the
			<lb />
			inadequacies in the procedure followed in arriving at those
			<lb />
			valuation as already pointed out.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			35.
			<lb />
			Next, it was submitted that the prosecution
			<lb />
			having failed to prove the inventory Exhibit 1, the value of
			<lb />
			household items at serial no.26 at page 117 of the
			<lb />
			judgment amounting to Rs.10,85,551/-ought to have
			<lb />
			been discarded from the statement of assets at the close
			<lb />
			of the check period.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			36.
			<lb />
			Thus, the total amount liable to be omitted from
			<lb />
			the list of assets at the close of check period would work
			<lb />
			out to Rs.35,65,329/-
			<lb />
			+ Rs.10,85,551/-, i.e.,
			<lb />
			Rs.46,50,880/-, thereby reducing it to Rs.27,86,373.73
			<lb />
			from the original Rs.74,37,253.73.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			37.
			<lb />
			It was then submitted that the Learned Trial
			<lb />
			Court in its impugned judgment under the head &apos;income&apos;
			<lb />
			of the Appellant did not give the following benefits:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<table>

			(b) This decision also was relied upon on his
			<lb />
			contentions that (i) in law it was permissible for
			<lb />
			an accused to produce evidence in his defence
			<lb />
			during the proceedings of the trial under Section
			<lb />
			233(3) Cr.P.C.; (ii) an accused can prove his
			<lb />
			case by the principle of balance of probability by
			<lb />
			relying upon the evidence of both the
			<lb />
			prosecution as well as the defence; and (iii) that
			<lb />
			it is impermissible in law for a Court to reject
			<lb />
			documents produced by an accused in his
			<lb />
			defence unreasonably and in an arbitrary
			<lb />
			manner.
			<lb />
			On the aforesaid contentions reliance was
			<lb />
			also placed upon the decisions of this Court in
			<lb />
			Criminal Appeal No.4 of 2007 : Central Bureau
			<lb />
			of Investigation vs. Nar Bahadur Bhandari and
			<lb />
			O. T. Bhutia vs. State of Sikkim : 2011 CRI.L.J.
			<lb />
			2860 (Sikkim).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) It is also the case of the Appellant that the
			<lb />
			prosecution has unreasonably clubbed his
			<lb />
			income with the income of the wife of the
			<lb />
			Appellant, Smt. Dikila Subba, and has
			<lb />
			proceeded under an erroneous presumption that
			<lb />
			it constituted the income of the Appellant alone
			<lb />
			thereby vitiating the very foundation of the
			<lb />
			prosecution case. The case of K. Inbasagaran
			<lb />
			(supra) (paragraphs 10, 13 and 14) was referred
			<lb />
			to and relied upon in support of this contention.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d) It was also the case of the Appellant that his
			<lb />
			wife whose income had been clubbed with that
			<lb />
			of his was an important witness for the
			<lb />
			prosecution and ought to have been examined
			<lb />
			by the prosecution. This having not been done
			<lb />
			and rather left for the defence to produce her as
			<lb />
			its witness, further renders the case of the
			<lb />
			prosecution questionable and doubtful. Reliance
			<lb />
			on this was placed in the case of Surya
			<lb />
			Sankaram Karri (supra).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			39.
			<lb />
			Mr. J. B. Pradhan, the Learned Public
			<lb />
			Prosecutor, on the other hand, submitted that the Learned
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			Trial Court was fully justified in arriving at its findings
			<lb />
			contained in the impugned judgment and the grounds
			<lb />
			raised by the Appellant seeking to assail those were not
			<lb />
			sustainable.
			<lb />
			The contentions placed by him as are
			<lb />
			considered relevant for disposal of this Appeal are set out
			<lb />
			below in brief.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			That the family of the Appellant consisting of his
			<lb />
			wife Smt. Dikila Subba, son Vivek Karma Subba
			<lb />
			and daughter Yashmin Y. Subba were the
			<lb />
			dependents of the Appellant during the check
			<lb />
			period sharing common kitchen and living under
			<lb />
			the same roof as would appear from the evidence
			<lb />
			of D. S. Rai, I.O., P.W.69 and Smt. Dikila Subba,
			<lb />
			D.W.2.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			That the period between 1978 and December, 2004
			<lb />
			was taken as the check period for the case as most
			<lb />
			of the assets and wealth were found to have been
			<lb />
			acquired by the Appellant during that period as
			<lb />
			woud be evident from the deposition of PI D. S.
			<lb />
			Rai, I.O., P.W.69 and the various documentary
			<lb />
			exhibits.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			That in the supplementary charge-sheet filed as a
			<lb />
			consequence of further investigation under Section
			<lb />
			173(8) Cr.P.C., the quantum of disproportionate
			<lb />
			assets in possession of the Appellant was reduced
			<lb />
			to Rs.28,39,204/-from Rs.40,04,753.87 as
			<lb />
			contained in the original charge-sheet.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			Mr. Pradhan then went on to refer to the various
			<lb />
			portions of the judgment to emphasise how the
			<lb />
			prosecution had proved the extent of possession
			<lb />
			of assets of the Appellant and his dependent
			<lb />
			family members at the close of the check period,
			<lb />
			at the beginning of the check period, their income
			<lb />
			and expenditure during the check period.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(v)
			<lb />
			It is then submitted that deduction of the value of
			<lb />
			the assets in possession of the accused at the
			<lb />
			beginning of the check period from the value of the
			<lb />
			assets found in the possession of the accused at
			<lb />
			the close of the check period, would reflect the
			<lb />
			value of the assets acquired by the accused during
			<lb />
			the check period which works up to Rs.85,38,829/.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(vi)
			<lb />
			That the value of assets acquired by the Appellant
			<lb />
			during the check period added to the total
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			expenditure incurred by the Appellant during that
			<lb />
			period works out to Rs.10,32,864/-which is the
			<lb />
			gross value of the assets and wealth acquired by
			<lb />
			the Appellant during the check period.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Deduction of the total income of the Appellant
			<lb />
			during the check period from the total value of the
			<lb />
			assets and wealth acquired by the accused during
			<lb />
			the check period will result in the value of the
			<lb />
			disproportionate assets found in the possession of
			<lb />
			the Appellant at the end of the check period which
			<lb />
			works out to Rs.30,63,989/-.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(viii) That during the investigation, the Investigating
			<lb />
			Agency had afforded ample opportunities to the
			<lb />
			Appellant to explain such disproportionate assets
			<lb />
			in his possession which is evident from the
			<lb />
			deposition of the I.O., P.W.69, in his examination-
			<lb />
			in-chief. The Appellant instead of chose to adopt
			<lb />
			evading tactics to slow down the investigation and
			<lb />
			to find fault with the investigation.
			<lb />
			That the valuation of the four buildings of the
			<lb />
			Appellant as in Exhibits 126, 156, 127 and 129
			<lb />
			are based upon the respective years of its
			<lb />
			construction furnished by the Appellant in his
			<lb />
			Annual Property Reports, Exhibits 32 to 37,
			<lb />
			proved by P.Ws 4 and 5. That the Engineers have
			<lb />
			applied the SORs of the period proximate to the
			<lb />
			year of construction of each building and,
			<lb />
			therefore, barring a few discrepancies, the
			<lb />
			valuation reports are correct. That the buildings
			<lb />
			of the Appellant and his family members cannot
			<lb />
			be without a valuation and since the Appellant in
			<lb />
			his defence has not proved the alternative
			<lb />
			valuation of the buildings as per his version, the
			<lb />
			valuation reports by the Government Engineers
			<lb />
			has to be considered as correct in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case. The prosecution has
			<lb />
			given due benefits of incomes and expenditure to
			<lb />
			the Appellant wherever he was reasonably found
			<lb />
			entitled to.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(x)
			<lb />
			That the efforts of the Appellant to prove through
			<lb />
			defence evidence that he had more income than
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			the ones listed in Statement C of the
			<lb />
			supplementary charge-sheet in the form of
			<lb />
			personal loans, help and assistance from relatives
			<lb />
			did not inspire confidence as those were not
			<lb />
			disclosed to the I.O. during the investigation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(xi) That the attempt on the part of the Appellant to
			<lb />
			prove by examining his wife as D.W.2, that she
			<lb />
			had income from &apos;Tshangu&apos; film business, business
			<lb />
			of supply and running Hotel Asia, could not be
			<lb />
			believed for his failure to produce documentary
			<lb />
			evidence to substantiate such claim and the proof
			<lb />
			that she was being assessed to income tax on such
			<lb />
			business.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(xii)
			<lb />
			Replying on the question of unreliability of the
			<lb />
			valuations of the buildings and the electrifications,
			<lb />
			for failure on the part of the prosecution to
			<lb />
			produce the SORs for the relevant years, it was
			<lb />
			submitted that the existence of the SORs was to
			<lb />
			be presumed having come in the deposition of
			<lb />
			engineers who are responsible Government
			<lb />
			Officers and that since the SORs are published in
			<lb />
			the Official Gazette, there is a presumption that
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			those are genuine documents by application of
			<lb />
			Section 81 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the valuation cannot be questioned
			<lb />
			simply because the SORs were not produced and
			<lb />
			proved. In support of this contention, the Learned
			<lb />
			Public Prosecution referred to the cases of -
			<lb />

			<lb />
			1988, reliance was placed upon State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra vs. Wasudeo Ram Ramchandra
			<lb />
			Kaidalwar : (1981) 3 SCC 199 (paragraph 13) and
			<lb />
			most extensibly a decision of the Orissa High Court

			<lb />
			Relying, inter alia, upon
			<lb />
			Khandu Sonu Dhobi and Another vs. The State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra : AIR 1972 SC 958 it was submitted
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			that all forms of irregularities do not vitiate the
			<lb />
			trial unless the defect in the investigation is such
			<lb />
			as would result in miscarriage of justice. The other
			<lb />
			cases relied upon on the above principle were

			<lb />
			We have considered the respective submissions
			<lb />
			placed on behalf of the parties, examined the evidence
			<lb />
			and the records.
			<lb />
			Before embarking upon the merits of
			<lb />
			the case, we feel it essential to lay down the principle and
			<lb />
			scope governing Sections 5(1)(e) of the PC Act, 1947 that
			<lb />
			corresponds to Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act, 1988. For
			<lb />
			convenience, we may at the first instance reproduce
			<lb />
			Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act, 1988 which is in verbatim
			<lb />
			the provisions of Section 5(1)(e) of the PC Act, 1947.

			<lb />
			Criminal misconduct by a public
			<lb />
			servant.-(1) A public servant is said to commit the
			<lb />
			offence of criminal misconduct,-
			<lb />
			………………………………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(e) if he or any person on his behalf, is in
			<lb />
			possession or has, at any time during
			<lb />
			the period of his office, been in
			<lb />
			possession for which the public servant
			<lb />
			cannot
			<lb />
			satisfactorily
			<lb />
			account,
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			pecuniary
			<lb />
			resources
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			property
			<lb />
			disproportionate to his known sources
			<lb />
			of income.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			41.
			<lb />
			The scope of the aforesaid provision has been
			<lb />
			found well expounded in Wasudeo Ramchandra
			<lb />
			Kaidalwar (supra) referred to by the learned Public
			<lb />
			Prosecutor in the following:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;13. …………………..The ingredients of the offence
			<lb />
			of criminal misconduct under Section 5(2) read with
			<lb />
			Section 5(1)(e) are the possession of pecuniary
			<lb />
			resources or property disproportionate to the known
			<lb />
			sources of income for which the public servant cannot
			<lb />
			satisfactorily account. To substantiate the charge, the
			<lb />
			prosecution must prove the following facts before it can
			<lb />
			bring a case under Section 5(1)(e), namely, (1) it must
			<lb />
			establish that the accused is a public servant, (2) the
			<lb />
			nature and extent of the pecuniary resources or
			<lb />
			property which were found in his possession, (3) it
			<lb />
			must be proved as to what were his known sources of
			<lb />
			income i.e. known to the prosecution, and (4) it must
			<lb />
			prove, quite objectively, that such resources or
			<lb />
			property found in possession of the accused were
			<lb />
			disproportionate to his known sources of income. Once
			<lb />
			these four ingredients are established, the offence of
			<lb />
			criminal misconduct under Section 5(1)(e) is complete,
			<lb />
			unless the accused is able to account for such
			<lb />
			resources or property. The burden then shifts to the
			<lb />
			accused to satisfactorily account for his possession of
			<lb />
			disproportionate assets. The extent and nature of
			<lb />
			burden of proof resting upon the public servant to be
			<lb />
			found in possession of disproportionate assets under
			<lb />
			Section 5(1)(e) cannot be higher than the test laid by
			<lb />
			the court in Jhangan case [AIR 1966 SC 1762], i.e. to
			<lb />
			establish
			<lb />
			his
			<lb />
			case
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			a
			<lb />
			preponderance
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			probability………………&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			42.
			<lb />
			This principle has been consistently followed in
			<lb />
			the subsequent decisions of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court
			<lb />
			one of which is K. Veeraswamy vs. Union of India and
			<lb />
			Others : (1991) 3 SCC 655 where the principle has been
			<lb />
			better explained as would be apparent from the following:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;72. ………………………… It is for the prosecution to
			<lb />
			prove that the accused or any person on his behalf,
			<lb />
			has been in possession of pecuniary resources or
			<lb />
			property disproportionate to his known sources of
			<lb />
			income. When that onus is discharged by the
			<lb />
			prosecution, it is for the accused to account
			<lb />
			satisfactorily for the disproportionality of the properties
			<lb />
			possessed by him. The section makes available
			<lb />
			statutory defence which must be proved by the
			<lb />
			accused. It is a restricted defence that is accorded to
			<lb />
			the accused to account for the disproportionality of the
			<lb />
			assets over the income. But the legal burden of proof
			<lb />
			placed on the accused is not so onerous as that of the
			<lb />
			prosecution. However, it is just not throwing some
			<lb />
			doubt on the prosecution version. The legislature has
			<lb />
			advisedly used the expression &quot;satisfactorily account&quot;.
			<lb />
			The emphasis must be on the word &quot;satisfactorily&quot;.
			<lb />
			That means the accused has to satisfy the court that
			<lb />
			his explanation is worthy of acceptance. The burden of
			<lb />
			proof placed on the accused is an evidential burden
			<lb />
			though not a persuasive burden. The accused however,
			<lb />
			could discharge that burden of proof &quot;on the balance of
			<lb />
			probabilities&quot; either from the evidence of the
			<lb />
			prosecution and/or evidence from the defence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			43.
			<lb />
			In the backdrop of the parameter of law set out,
			<lb />
			it is, thus, essential for us to consider as to whether in the
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances of the case, the prosecution has
			<lb />
			been able to discharge its initial burden and, if so, as to
			<lb />
			whether the appellant has been able to satisfactorily
			<lb />
			account therefor by discharging the burden of proof on the
			<lb />
			balance of probabilities. In furtherance to achieving that
			<lb />
			object, we may examine the facts of the case, as
			<lb />
			application of the law would certainly depend upon that.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			44.
			<lb />
			From the charge-sheet as set out in the earlier
			<lb />
			part of this judgment and considering the stand taken by
			<lb />
			the prosecution during the trial it goes without saying that
			<lb />
			the entire assets set out in Statement B and the income
			<lb />
			during the check period contained in Statement C have
			<lb />
			been construed and presumed as the assets of the
			<lb />
			Appellant.
			<lb />
			This is a fact which shall be relevant for
			<lb />
			discussions that will follow later at an appropriate stage.
			<lb />
			But to begin with, we have found, as is the case of both
			<lb />
			the prosecution and the Appellant, that the bulk of the
			<lb />
			assets at the end of the check period and the income
			<lb />
			during the check period is constituted by 7 plots of landed
			<lb />
			properties, the agricultural income earned from those, 4
			<lb />
			RCC buildings and the rental income earned from those
			<lb />
			buildings.
			<lb />
			It is, therefore, necessary for us to examine
			<lb />
			as to whether the prosecution has been able to discharge
			<lb />
			its initial burden that the Appellant has been in possession
			<lb />
			of the pecuniary resources or properties disproportionate
			<lb />
			to his known sources of income.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			45.
			<lb />
			It is the consistent case of the Appellant at the
			<lb />
			trial and before this Court that except for one plot of land
			<lb />
			situated at Singhithang block, South Sikkim, rest of the
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			properties including the buildings are in fact the properties
			<lb />
			of his wife,
			<lb />
			Smt. Dikila Subba.
			<lb />
			The other landed
			<lb />
			properties said to be owned by his wife are Plot No.737
			<lb />
			measuring 1.3880 hectares under Barbing, Ranka Block,
			<lb />
			East Sikkim, Plots No.110/753 and 111/752 measuring
			<lb />
			.0920 hectares under Tadong Block, Plot No.523
			<lb />
			measuring .2320 hectares under Barbing Block, East
			<lb />
			Sikkim, Plot No.181 under Sripatam Block, South Sikkim,
			<lb />
			Plot No.Nil measuring 1.10 acres under Simkharka Block,
			<lb />
			South Sikkim and Plot No.236 measuring .2080 hectates
			<lb />
			under Sichey Block, East Sikkim.
			<lb />
			In so far as RCC
			<lb />
			buildings are concerned, they are (1) a three storied RCC
			<lb />
			building at Sichey Busty, Gangtok, (2) a six storied RCC
			<lb />
			building at Pani House in the 31A-NH, Gangtok, (3) a five
			<lb />
			storied RCC building at Development Area, Gangtok and
			<lb />
			(4) a three storied RCC building at Arithang, Gangtok.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			46.
			<lb />
			In a case of the present kind, the foundation for
			<lb />
			arriving at a finding of disproportionate assets is the
			<lb />
			valuation of the properties making it vital for us to
			<lb />
			consider the correctness or the reliability of the valuation.
			<lb />
			The relevant prosecution witnesses on the valuation of the
			<lb />
			four buildings are P.Ws 31, 55, 62 and 68. These are the
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			persons who had inspected the four buildings, measured
			<lb />
			them and prepared the valuation reports.
			<lb />
			We may
			<lb />
			reproduce the relevant extracts of their evidence
			<lb />
			individually below:-

			All the four buildings of the accused and his wife

			inspected and measured by us were done floor wise,
			<lb />

		<item>
			It is true that the calculation sheets prepared at
			<lb />
			the spot by us relating to valuation reports Exbt.126 to
			<lb />
			Exbt.129 are not available in the case records. Police
			<lb />
			had however seized the said calculation reports taken
			<lb />
			at the spot. The valuation reports Exbt.126 to Exbt.129
			<lb />
			were typed out by the office clerk. ……………….……
			<lb />
			While preparing Exbt.126 to Exbt.129 and Exbt.5
			<lb />
			to Exbt.12 we did not refer to the approved blue print
			<lb />
			plan of the respective buildings as the same were not
			<lb />
			before us. The measurements shown in the various
			<lb />
			exhibits pertaining to the foundation of the buildings
			<lb />
			refered (sic) to above were not taken but the
			<lb />
			measurements were based on assumptions and the
			<lb />
			reports also reflects the same. It is true that had we
			<lb />
			refered (sic) to the various Blue Print Plans of the
			<lb />
			buildings then the measurements relating to the
			<lb />
			foundations of the respective buildings would have
			<lb />
			been accurate. It is true that the the (sic) respective
			<lb />
			valuation reports for foundations items are not
			<lb />
			accurate. ……………………………………

		<lb />
		<item>
			We did not ascertain the extent of the total
			<lb />
			number of floors constructed up to 1.12.2004 of the
			<lb />
			various buildings of the accused since we valued the
			<lb />
			entire buildings on 8.9.2005.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			It is true that when assessment of a building
			<lb />
			constructed in a particular year is valued the
			<lb />

			Exhibit 194 as Rs.2,30,281/-. The latter appears to be a

			depreciated value and, therefore, presumably accepted by
			<lb />
			the Trial Court.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			49.
			<lb />
			We have also noticed a large number of
			<lb />
			corrections in the valuation reports which P.Ws 31, 55, 62
			<lb />
			and 68 have not been able to explain although they were
			<lb />
			the ones who prepared them.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			50.
			<lb />
			We find the same deficiencies in the valuation of
			<lb />
			internal wirings of the aforesaid buildings, namely, Exhibit
			<lb />
			140 for the Sichey building, Exhibit 159 for the Pani House
			<lb />
			building, Exhibit 164 in respect of the building at
			<lb />
			Development Area, Gangtok (Mandaar Lodge) and Exhibit
			<lb />
			165 in respect of building at Arithang. It was stated that
			<lb />
			for all these valuations SOR for the year 1989 had been
			<lb />
			applied when, except for the house at Development Area
			<lb />
			which was said to have been constructed in 1988-89,
			<lb />
			concededly were constructed much earlier.
			<lb />
			From the
			<lb />
			evidence we find that the buildings at Sichey and Pani
			<lb />
			House were constructed in the year 1978 and the one at
			<lb />
			Arithang in the year 1981-82. It is an admitted case that
			<lb />
			no depreciation was allowed on the valuation of any of
			<lb />
			those buildings. It is also in the evidence of P.W.49, an
			<lb />
			Engineer in the Power Department, Government of Sikkim,
			<lb />
			who had conducted the valuation in the building at Pani
			<lb />
			House, that the rates of certain materials in the 1989 SOR
			<lb />
			which had been applied by them were higher than the
			<lb />
			market rates. It is also in the evidence of P.W.49 that
			<lb />
			there were concealed wirings as well as baton wirings,
			<lb />
			casing and capping wirings and that they had not
			<lb />
			consulted the concerned person who had fitted the electric
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			lines.
			<lb />
			It is, therefore, difficult to understand as to how
			<lb />
			the valuation as reflected in Exhibit 159 was arrived at
			<lb />
			when the wirings were not visible.
			<lb />
			It is also in the
			<lb />
			evidence of this witness that Exhibit 159 was prepared in
			<lb />
			2006 when the check period was only till 01-12-2004 and
			<lb />
			admittedly the number of storeys added to the building
			<lb />
			after 01-12-2004 was not verified. The SOR of 1989 was
			<lb />
			also concededly not produced. P.W.50, Assistant Engineer
			<lb />
			in the Power Department who prepared the reports of the
			<lb />
			buildings Exhibit 160 also conceded that the year of
			<lb />
			construction of the buildings were not ascertained and the
			<lb />
			SORs vary as per market price of the respective items.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51.
			<lb />
			As regards the building housing the Mandaar
			<lb />
			Lodge at Development Area and Hotel Reverie at
			<lb />
			Panihouse, SORs of 1989 that was said to have been
			<lb />
			applied, was not produced. It is an admitted position in
			<lb />
			the evidence of P.W.54, Executive Engineer, Power
			<lb />
			Department, that the valuation of Mandaar Lodge was on
			<lb />
			the higher side and were not accurate since the SOR of
			<lb />
			1989 was applied in respect of wirings and fittings that
			<lb />
			were laid and installed long before that.
			<lb />
			It is also
			<lb />
			admitted that valuation in respect of Hotel Reverie at
			<lb />
			Panihouse was incorrect.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>

			<lb />
			With regard to the internal wiring of the
			<lb />
			building at Arithang, PW-50, the Assistant Engineer, Power
			<lb />
			Department who prepared the valuation, Exhibit 165, has
			<lb />
			admitted in his evidence that the valuation was done in
			<lb />
			the year 2006 without ascertaining the year of its
			<lb />
			construction and the number of floors that were added to
			<lb />
			those building after 01-12-2004. That the rough sheets
			<lb />
			upon which notes were taken down while taking the
			<lb />
			measurements to arrive at the valuation were not seized
			<lb />
			by the Police. Admittedly also SORs vary as per market
			<lb />
			price of respective items and that rates are prepared
			<lb />
			maintaining a margin of 10% as contractors&apos; profit
			<lb />
			maintaining additional margin of 4% for the purpose of
			<lb />
			sales tax. It is seen that the nature of the wirings are the
			<lb />
			same in all the buildings as the one at Sichey.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			53.
			<lb />
			Similarly, PW-60, who was also involved in the
			<lb />
			valuation of electrical fittings conceded that there were
			<lb />
			vast differences in rates of some of the items quoted in
			<lb />
			the valuations of the buildings.
			<lb />
			For instance, it is
			<lb />
			admitted that the price of MCB with box 16 Amps has
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			been taken as Rs.108/-in case of Arithang building but for
			<lb />
			the same item it has been shown as Rs.330/-per piece,
			<lb />
			i.e., more than 300%, in case of the building at
			<lb />
			Panihouse. Similarly, in the Arithang building the rate of
			<lb />
			wire in item 20 is qoted as Rs.11/-per piece of 6
			<lb />
			sq.ml.meter of copper wire, while for a lesser power of 1.5
			<lb />
			sq.ml.meter at item 7 statement it is quoted as Rs.33.50.
			<lb />
			The rates of &apos;bus-bar&apos; of Panihouse building constructed in
			<lb />
			1978 and the one at Development Area constructed in
			<lb />
			1994, i.e., sixteen years later, are identical at Rs.1372/-.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			For all the aforesaid reasons, the valuations of the
			<lb />
			internal wirings of the buildings also do not inspire our
			<lb />
			confidence.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			54.
			<lb />
			Mr. J. B. Pradhan, Learned Public Prosecutor has
			<lb />
			no doubt submitted that the Engineers have applied the
			<lb />
			SOR of the period proximate to the year of construction of
			<lb />
			each of the buildings and that barring few discrepancies
			<lb />
			the valuation reports are correct.
			<lb />
			It is further his
			<lb />
			submission that the buildings of the Appellant and the
			<lb />
			members of his family cannot be without a valuation and
			<lb />
			since the Appellant has not proved any alternative
			<lb />
			valuation the one submitted by the Government Engineer
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			have to be accepted as correct.
			<lb />
			We also find that the
			<lb />
			Learned Special Judge in the impugned judgment has
			<lb />
			accepted the valuations as those having been assessed by
			<lb />
			persons who had been doing this regularly.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			55.
			<lb />
			In our view, the submission of the Learned
			<lb />
			Public Prosecutor and the approach of the Learned Trial
			<lb />
			Court do not appear to be sound. We have already dealt
			<lb />
			with in detail as to why it was essential for the prosecution
			<lb />
			to have produced the SORs said to have been applied for
			<lb />
			the purpose of the valuation.
			<lb />
			We have held that
			<lb />
			withholding the SORs firstly deprives not only the
			<lb />
			Appellant but also the Court to examine the correctness of
			<lb />
			the valuations and secondly, renders the very existence of
			<lb />
			those SORs suspect. We have also pointed out the serious
			<lb />
			discrepancies noticed in the method adopted while valuing
			<lb />
			the buildings.
			<lb />
			These, in our view, are not minor
			<lb />
			discrepancies but rather fatal for the prosecution case.
			<lb />
			The discrepancy casts a serious doubt on the valuations
			<lb />
			which is the sole ingredient for assessing the
			<lb />
			disproportionateness of the Appellant&apos;s assets.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			56.
			<lb />
			As per Mr. J. B. Pradhan the SORs having been
			<lb />
			published in the Official Gazette there is a presumption of
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			its genuineness under Section 81 of the Evidence Act. He
			<lb />
			submits that the SORs are admissible in evidence being
			<lb />
			Official record evidencing public affairs and that the Court
			<lb />
			can presume its contents as genuine also under Sections
			<lb />
			35 and 38 read with 81 of the Evidence Act unless the
			<lb />
			contrary is proved. In support of his contention, reliance
			<lb />
			was placed in Bala Shankar Bhattjee (supra), ITC
			<lb />
			Bhadrachalam Paper Boards (supra) and Ganesh Das
			<lb />
			Bhojraj (supra).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			57.
			<lb />
			We are not impressed by the submission of Mr.
			<lb />
			Pradhan as he has clearly misconstrued the provision of
			<lb />
			Section 81 and other cognate provisions of the Evidence
			<lb />
			Act referred to by him. For better appreciation, Section 81
			<lb />
			is reproduced below:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;81.
			<lb />
			Presumption
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			Gazettes,
			<lb />
			newspapers, private Acts of Parliament and other
			<lb />
			documents.-
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			Court
			<lb />
			shall
			<lb />
			presume
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			genuineness of every document purporting to be the
			<lb />
			London Gazette, or [any Official Gazette, or the
			<lb />
			Government Gazette] of any colony, dependency of
			<lb />
			possession of the British Crown, or to be a newspaper
			<lb />
			or journal, or to be a copy of a private Act of
			<lb />
			Parliament [of the United Kingdom] printed by the
			<lb />
			Queen&apos;s Printer and of every document purporting to
			<lb />
			be a document directed by any law to be kept by any
			<lb />
			person, if such document is kept substantially in the
			<lb />
			form required by law and is produced from proper
			<lb />
			custody.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			58.
			<lb />
			On a bare reading of the provision it will be
			<lb />
			apparent that the genuineness of any Official Gazette or a
			<lb />
			Government Gazette will be presumed by a Court &quot;if such
			<lb />
			document is kept substantially in the form required by law
			<lb />
			and is produced from proper custody&quot;. In other words, in
			<lb />
			order for the Court to presume the genuineness of
			<lb />
			anything published in the Official Gazette it is mandatory
			<lb />
			in law to produce such Gazette before the Court by a
			<lb />
			person having its lawful custody. In all the three cases
			<lb />
			referred to by Mr. Pradhan the concerned documents that
			<lb />
			were published in the Gazette had been produced and it
			<lb />
			was under such facts and circumstance that the decisions
			<lb />
			were rendered. As already noted by us, in the present
			<lb />
			case the prosecution has failed to produce the SORs. The
			<lb />
			contention, therefore, appears to be clearly misconceived.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			59.
			<lb />
			In G. M. Tank vs. State of Gujarat &amp; Another :
			<lb />
			AIR 2006 SC 2129 it has been held that -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;20. The provisions contained in Section
			<lb />
			5(1)(e) is self-contained provision. The first part of the
			<lb />
			Section casts a burden on the prosecution and the
			<lb />
			second on the accused as stated above. From the
			<lb />
			words used in clause (e) of Section 5(1) of the P.C. Act
			<lb />
			it is implied that the burden is on the accused to
			<lb />
			account for the sources for the acquisition of
			<lb />
			disproportionate assets. As in all other criminal cases
			<lb />
			wherein the accused is charged with an offence, the
			<lb />
			prosecution is required to discharge the burden of
			<lb />
			establishing the charge beyond reasonable doubt.
			<lb />
			……………….……….&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			60.
			<lb />
			From the mass of confusion emerging from the
			<lb />
			evidence of the prosecution witnesses analyzed above, it is
			<lb />
			difficult for us to accept that the prosecution has
			<lb />
			discharged its burden of establishing the charge beyond
			<lb />
			reasonable doubt. A number of SORs have been referred
			<lb />
			to but those were neither produced nor tendered in
			<lb />
			evidence. Had it been brought on record it would have
			<lb />
			assured us of the existence of such SORs, facilitating us in
			<lb />
			verifying the correctness of the valuations and of those
			<lb />
			SORs having been applied. It has also been revealed from
			<lb />
			the evidence that although the SORs of the years
			<lb />
			proximate to the years of construction of the buildings
			<lb />
			were available, the valuers preferred to apply the SORs of
			<lb />
			distant periods.
			<lb />
			We do not find the method of
			<lb />
			&quot;depreciation&quot; having been applied except for the building
			<lb />
			at Pani House with regard to which we have already
			<lb />
			discussed. The other aspect which is the cause of our
			<lb />
			grave concern, is the application of market rates
			<lb />
			admittedly without verifying and ascertaining its
			<lb />
			correctness. We have also noticed in the evidence of
			<lb />
			P.W.68 that in the Pani House building while arriving at
			<lb />
			the valuation, Exhibit 156, SORs of 1994 had been applied
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			when admittedly the building was constructed in 1985. It
			<lb />
			baffles us as to why SORs of the year 1982 at least were
			<lb />
			not applied, when admittedly it was available as per this
			<lb />
			witness.
			<lb />
			Apart from all these, there are conflicting
			<lb />
			versions appearing in the evidence of PWs 31, 55, 62 and
			<lb />
			68 as to which of the SORs would apply.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			61.
			<lb />
			Non-production of the SORs said to have been
			<lb />
			applied would certainly amount to concealment of
			<lb />
			evidence and by application of Section 114(g) of the
			<lb />
			Evidence Act an adverse presumption would arise against
			<lb />
			the prosecution.
			<lb />
			The conflicting, confused and rather
			<lb />
			vague nature of evidence alluded to in detail further
			<lb />
			confounds the matter, rendering the case of the
			<lb />
			prosecution on this aspect gravely suspect.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			prosecution most certainly has failed to pass the test laid
			<lb />
			down in the case of Wasudeo Ramchandra Kaidalwar
			<lb />
			(supra) and G. M. Tank (Supra) and consequently has
			<lb />
			failed to discharge the initial burden cast upon it under
			<lb />
			Section 5(1)(e) of the PC Act, 1947 corresponding to
			<lb />
			Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act, 1988.
			<lb />
			Under similar
			<lb />
			circumstances this Court, in Crl.Appeal No.4/2008 in
			<lb />
			Padam Lal Gurung vs. State of Sikkim; Crl. Appeal
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			No.4/2010; Central Bureau of Investigation vs. N. B.
			<lb />
			Bhandari; in O. T. Bhutia vs. State of Sikkim (2010) 4
			<lb />
			Crimes 446 and in Crl.Appeal No.05 of 2007 : Shri Nar
			<lb />
			Bahadur Bhandari vs. State of Sikkim, had quashed the
			<lb />
			prosecution cases as the valuation of the assets which
			<lb />
			formed the basis of the alleged disproportionate assets
			<lb />
			were found to be unreliable for the same inadequacies
			<lb />
			found in the present case.
			<lb />
			It has been observed by a Single Bench of this
			<lb />
			Court in O.T.Bhutia vs. State of Sikkim (supra) that -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;As has been held in the State of Maharashtra v.
			<lb />
			Wasudeo Ramchandra Kaidalwar (supra), the
			<lb />
			burden shifts only when those four ingredients are
			<lb />
			established. In the instant case, for the reason
			<lb />
			already indicated above, the burden did not shift.
			<lb />
			Then again the extent and nature of burden of proof
			<lb />
			resting upon public servant found in possession of
			<lb />
			disproportionate assets under Section 5(1)(e), as
			<lb />
			held in the said decision, cannot be higher than the
			<lb />
			test laid down by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Jhagan&apos;s case (AIR 1966 SC 1762), i.e. to establish
			<lb />
			the case by preponderance of probability.&quot;

			Brajeshwar Banerjee
			<lb />
			From 1983 to 1991, i.e., 9 years (108 months) @

			<lb />
			From 1984 to 1994, i.e., 11 years (132 months) @

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			On the above, we find that the I.O., PW-
			<lb />
			69,
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			his
			<lb />
			cross-examination has admitted
			<lb />
			affidavits having been filed by them during the
			<lb />
			investigation affirming payment of varying sums by
			<lb />
			them against rent to the wife of the Appellant and,
			<lb />
			that he did not take those into account during the
			<lb />
			investigation.
			<lb />
			Had the situation remained only
			<lb />
			thus, we may have considered granting the benefit
			<lb />
			of this unfair investigation to the Appellant, apart
			<lb />
			from the erroneous rejection of the affidavits by
			<lb />
			the learned Trial Court filed before it as Exhibit
			<lb />
			D3 by the Appellant, on the ground of those
			<lb />
			being only photocopies,
			<lb />
			when admittedly the
			<lb />
			originals had been submitted to the I.O. at the
			<lb />
			stage of investigation. But then, this did not absolve
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			the Appellant from the burden of proof of his claim
			<lb />
			by producing the three as witnesses. This having
			<lb />
			not been done, we find it difficult to accept the
			<lb />
			claims on this account and uphold the finding the

			&quot;…………………………………..
			<lb />
			It is true that as per letter dated: 6.12.12 the

			rent income of the wife of the accused has been shown
			<lb />
			at the rate of Rs: 610/-per month for the period

			…………………………….&quot;
			<lb />

		<item>
			(e)
			<lb />
			As per the above, the details of payment
			<lb />
			would thus be as under:-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			From 01-07-1986 to 30-06-1991, i.e., 5 years
			<lb />
			@ Rs.610/-p.m.
			<lb />
			= Rs.36,600/-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			From 01-07-1991 to 30-11-1996, i.e., 65
			<lb />
			months @ Rs.1,040/-p.m. = Rs.67,600/-
			<lb />
			Therefore, the total amount received from his
			<lb />
			Rs.36,600/-+ Rs.67,600/-= Rs.1,04,200/-.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			We do not see any reason as to why the claim
			<lb />
			should not be allowed as we find that such payment
			<lb />
			stands confirmed by a letter from a responsible
			<lb />
			officer of the Ministry under his official letter-head
			<lb />
			and signed under his official seal. Surprisingly, we do
			<lb />
			not find any discussion regarding this and appears to
			<lb />
			have been completely overlooked by the learned
			<lb />
			Special Judge.

		<head>
			II. Mandaar Lodge, Development Area
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			(a) We are inclined not to interfere with the
			<lb />
			rejection of rental income from Nirmal Dutta, D.W.4
			<lb />
			on the strength of Lease Agreements, Exhibit D-10
			<lb />
			and D-11, as we find the claim in conflict with the
			<lb />
			contents of the Income Tax file of M/s. Mandaar
			<lb />
			Lodge, Exhibit 45 which is an official record that
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			contains a letter dated 27-05-2003 written to the
			<lb />
			Joint Income Tax Officer by the Appellant&apos;s wife
			<lb />
			conveying that the &quot;hotel, MANDAAR TOURIST LODGE has
			<lb />
			been closed since the last THREE YEARS. That is, from the year
			<lb />
			2000 onwards, (after the lease with W.B Tourism got over).&quot; We
			<lb />
			find this duly recorded in the note addressed to the
			<lb />
			ITO at note sheet page 3 of the file, Exhibit 45.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(b)
			<lb />
			The Learned Trial Court is found to have
			<lb />
			accepted
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			claim
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			rental
			<lb />
			income
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Rs.13,92,300/-received by the wife of the Appellant
			<lb />
			from WBTDC on the strength of Lease Agreement,
			<lb />
			Exhibit 217 but rejected the claim of Rs.2,31,000/-
			<lb />
			against maintenance charges and for Satellite
			<lb />
			receiver System.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(c)
			<lb />
			The claim on additional charges was
			<lb />
			rejected on the ground that the Appellant was unable
			<lb />
			to prove it by any supporting documents and also
			<lb />
			having failed to establish that such payments were
			<lb />
			made by him. This finding, in our view, appears to
			<lb />
			be quite perverse to the very document, Exhibit 217,
			<lb />
			in which we find Clauses providing for the
			<lb />
			maintenance contract, marked Exhibit 217(n) and
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			Exhibit 217(o). The I.O., P.W.69 in his evidence has
			<lb />
			also conceded that &quot;Exb. 217 dated: 10.9.93 is the said Lease
			<lb />
			Deed and the enclosure thereof is the maintainance
			<lb />
			contract
			<lb />
			agreement which is an agreement in addition to the Lease
			<lb />
			Agreement. It is not a fact that I have not taken into account the
			<lb />
			sum of Rs: 3000/-per month payable to the owner of the Mandhar
			<lb />
			Lodge by the West Bengal Tourism Department for the entire period
			<lb />
			of Lease.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(d)
			<lb />
			We have examined the maintenance
			<lb />
			contract agreement and find that it contains two
			<lb />
			additional components for which charges were paid to
			<lb />
			the owner. We may, for convenience, reproduce the
			<lb />
			following:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;11. The Second Party shall also provide a fully
			<lb />
			maintenance System and Satellite receiver
			<lb />
			System for which the First party will pay Rs.
			<lb />
			1,200=00 (Rupees one thousand two hundred
			<lb />
			only per month.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			…………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			A SUM OF Rs. 1,800=00 (RUPEES ONE THOUSAND
			<lb />
			EIGHT HUNDRED) ONLY PER MONTH WILL BE PAID TO
			<lb />
			THE SECOND PARTY BY THE FIRST PARTY FOR
			<lb />
			CARRYING OUT ABOVE STATED MAINTENANCE
			<lb />
			WORKS.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			THIS AGREEMENT TAKES EFFECT FROM 01-04-95.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(e)
			<lb />
			Considering the fact that the WBTDC had
			<lb />
			been in occupation of the Mandaar Lodge building at
			<lb />
			Development Area from September, 1993 to August,
			<lb />
			2001 and that the maintenance agreement
			<lb />
			commenced from 01-04-1995 to the end of the
			<lb />
			period of lease, i.e., August, 2001, the Appellant&apos;s
			<lb />
			wife was entitled to the additional charges for 77
			<lb />
			months @ Rs.3,000/-per month which comes to
			<lb />
			Rs.2,31,000/-. We find it difficult to understand as to
			<lb />
			why the Learned Special Judge rejected this in the
			<lb />
			impugned judgment when the rental income in terms
			<lb />
			of the very Lease Deed, Exhibit 217 was found
			<lb />
			legitimate. We, therefore, allow an additional income
			<lb />
			of Rs.2,31,000/-against the special charges in terms
			<lb />
			of the maintenance contract agreement forming part
			<lb />
			of the Lease Deed, Exhibit 217. The total amount of
			<lb />
			rental income received from Mandaar Lodge would
			<lb />
			thus work out to Rs.16,23,000/-. (i.e. Rs.13,92,300/-+
			<lb />
			Rs.2,31,000/-)

		</table>
		<p>
			<lb />
			It is not understood as to why the learned
			<lb />
			Special Judge did not allow the rental income arising
			<lb />
			out of the five tenants, namely, PWs 40, 41, 43, 44
			<lb />
			and 45 amounting to Rs.2,47,900.00 while allowing
			<lb />
			the one accruing from PW56, the sixth tenant,
			<lb />
			amounting to Rs.3,86,160.00.
			<lb />
			Thus, the total rent accruing from the six
			<lb />
			tenants, namely, PWs 40, 41, 43, 44, 45 and 56
			<lb />
			would amount to Rs. 2,47,900.00 + Rs.3,86,160.00
			<lb />
			= Rs.6,34,060.00.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			(c)
			<lb />
			Out of the nine tenants occupying the
			<lb />
			Arithang building, we have noted that only six have
			<lb />
			entered the witness box, i.e., PWs 40, 41, 43, 44, 45
			<lb />
			and 56. The three others were not examined by the
			<lb />
			prosecution when it is in the evidence of PW56 that
			<lb />
			all the nine units in that building were fully occupied
			<lb />
			by tenants from the year 1985 to 2004 at an average
			<lb />
			monthly rent of Rs.900.00 per month. This having
			<lb />
			come in the evidence of a prosecution witness, we
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			have no hesitation in accepting that the remaining
			<lb />
			three tenants also occupied the premises and paid
			<lb />
			Rs.900.00 per month as rental. The evidence of
			<lb />
			PW56 assumes greater force, as it is undisputed that
			<lb />
			he was also the caretaker of the house and used to
			<lb />
			collect the monthly rents from the other tenants on
			<lb />
			behalf of the Appellant&apos;s wife.
			<lb />
			For the sake of clarity on this, we may
			<lb />
			reproduce below the evidence of PW-56, PW-40, PW-
			<lb />
			41 and PW-44 :-
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			PW-56
			<lb />
			&quot;I know the accused standing in the dock. I was
			<lb />
			residing in a rented room in the house of Dhan Subba
			<lb />
			between 1985 to 1991 and again between May 1996 to
			<lb />
			December 2004. My premises was on the first floor of
			<lb />
			the said building.
			<lb />
			Initially I was paying monthly rent of Rs: 1500/-
			<lb />
			later it was raised to Rs: 1700/-. The enhancement of
			<lb />
			the rent could have been in the year 1998 but I am not
			<lb />
			able to recollect the exact period now. The building
			<lb />
			was three storied which had nine units all of which
			<lb />
			were occupied by the tenants.

			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			I used to collect rents from all the tenants since
			<lb />
			the year 1985 till the year 2004 and rent per month in
			<lb />
			average used to be paid by each tenant at the rate of
			<lb />
			Rs: 900/-per month. All the nine rooms in the three
			<lb />
			floors were fully occupied by the tenants right from
			<lb />
			1985 till 2004.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>


		<item>
			PW-40
			<lb />
			&quot;I do not know the accused standing in the dock,
			<lb />
			however during November 2001 to end of 2004 I was
			<lb />
			residing in rent in the house of Dhan Subba at Arithang
			<lb />
			at a monthly rent of Rs.1400/-initially later it was
			<lb />
			increased to Rs.1600/-per month but I do not now
			<lb />
			recollect the month from which the rent was increased.
			<lb />
			One Shyam Bdr. Pradhan who was the caretaker
			<lb />
			of the house of the accused used to collect the monthly
			<lb />
			rent from me………………………………….&quot;

		</item>

		<item>
			PW-41
			<lb />
			&quot;I am seeing the accused standing in the dock
			<lb />
			for the first time today. During the year 1999 I was
			<lb />
			residing on rent in a building by the name of Dikila
			<lb />
			Building at Arithang at a monthly rent of Rs: 1500/-
			<lb />
			initially later after two years it was increased to Rs.
			<lb />
			1700/-per month.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			One old tenant in the said building used to
			<lb />
			collect the rents on behalf of the building owner from
			<lb />
			me……………….&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Cross-examination by Ld.Sr.counsels Shri A.
			<lb />
			Moulik and Shri N. B. Khatiwada assisted by Ld.
			<lb />
			Counsel Mrs. K. D. Bhutia for the accused
			<lb />
			&quot;…………………………………
			<lb />
			The old person of Pradhan community was the
			<lb />
			caretaker of the said building who was also a tenant in
			<lb />
			the same and used to collect rents from all the tenants
			<lb />
			of the building…………………………&quot;
			<lb />
			PW-44
			<lb />
			&quot;I have been residing on rent at Arithang in the
			<lb />
			RCC building of one D.B.Subba on rent. I do not kow
			<lb />
			the accused standing in the dock. However I have not
			<lb />
			met the owner of the building personally. The rents in
			<lb />
			respect of the premises occupied by me in the said
			<lb />
			building used to be collected by one Shyam Pradhan
			<lb />
			who was also a tenant in the same building…………..&quot;
			<lb />
			( emphasis supplied )
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(d)
			<lb />
			We may thus calculate the rent paid by the
			<lb />
			three other tenants as under:-
		</p>
		<lb />
		<table>
			Number
			<lb />
			of tenants
			<lb />
			Rental income
			<lb />
			per month
			<lb />
			Total number

			of years

			Gross Total
			<lb />
			03
			<lb />
			Rs.900/-
			<lb />
			20
			<lb />
			Rs.6,48,000/-
		</table>
		<lb />
		<p>
			Thus, the total rent collected by the
			<lb />
			Appellant&apos;s wife from the Arithang building for a
			<lb />
			period of 20 years would be, Rs.6,70,060/-(from six
			<lb />
			tenants) +
			<lb />
			Rs.6,48,000/-(from three tenants) =
			<lb />
			Rs.13,18,060/-.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(e)
			<lb />
			As regards the Jorethang building, PW-47,
			<lb />
			as would appear from his evidence, was a tenant in it
			<lb />
			from January, 2002 to December, 2004 i.e.,
			<lb />
			months, on payment of a monthly rent of Rs.1000.00
			<lb />
			thereby making Rs.36,000.00 as the total amount of
			<lb />
			rent paid by him against Rs.20,000.00 accepted by
			<lb />
			the Special Court.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(f)
			<lb />
			We find that the trial Court has allowed
			<lb />
			only Rs.4,06,160.00 as total rental income for both
			<lb />
			the buildings at Arithang and Jorethang, which
			<lb />
			obviously appear to be the total rent of
			<lb />
			Rs.3,86,160.00 paid only by PW56 at Arithang
			<lb />
			building overlooking the payment made by the
			<lb />
			other tenants, PWs 40, 41, 43, 44 and 45 and,
			<lb />
			Rs.20,000.00 by PW47 for the Jorethang building.
			<lb />
			From what we have discussed, this obviously is
			<lb />
			errorneous as the total amount for the two buildings
			<lb />
			would infact
			<lb />
			be Rs. 13,54,060.00 i.e., Rs.
			<lb />
			13,18,060.00 for the Arithang building plus Rs.
			<lb />
			36,000.00 from the Jorethang building.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(g) From the aforesaid discussions, the total amount
			<lb />
			of rental income would thus be as follows:-

		</table>

		<p>
			63.
			<lb />
			Following the principle laid down in K.
			<lb />
			Veeraswamy (supra) it is permissible for the Appellant to
			<lb />
			rely upon the prosecution witnesses to explain and prove
			<lb />
			his case. The rental income pertaining to Arithang and
			<lb />
			Jorethang buildings in particular have been calculated
			<lb />
			solely on the basis of the evidence of prosecution
			<lb />
			witnesses and, therefore, as held in In Re K. V.
			<lb />
			Ayyaswamy : AIR 1965 AP 105 it is not necessary for
			<lb />
			the Appellant to adduce evidence aliunde to prove those
			<lb />
			very facts. It is also pertinent to note that none of the
			<lb />
			prosecution witnesses were declared hostile.
			<lb />

		<head>
			IV. Income from agriculture
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			64.(a)
			<lb />
			Referring to items no.12 to 18 under Statement
			<lb />
			C of the charge sheet, it was submitted by Mr. Moulik that
			<lb />
			the Appellant had been given the benefit of the income of
			<lb />
			Rs.14,80,806/-which was reduced in the supplementary
			<lb />
			charge sheet to Rs.8,73,623/-. This was later enhanced
			<lb />
			to Rs.13,49,633/-by the Learned Trial Court in the
			<lb />
			impugned judgment for the reasons given in paragraphs
			<lb />
			86 to 91. Mr. Moulik, however, submits that the amount
			<lb />
			ought to have been Rs.25,10,600/-for the reasons stated
			<lb />
			briefly as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The agriculture income against Singithang land for
			<lb />
			the period 1985 to 2004 vide Exhibit 47 at
			<lb />
			Rs.59,800/-was accepted by the Learned Trial
			<lb />
			Court and also conceded on behalf of the Appellant;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The total income of Rs. 10,36,856.00 conceded by
			<lb />
			the prosecution in respect of the land at Sripatam
			<lb />
			and Dew at Rs.1,47,240/-and Rs.8,89,616/-
			<lb />
			respectively, was incorrect when it ought to have
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			been Rs.11,00,800/-which as per the learned
			<lb />
			Counsel is the correct value of the annual income of
			<lb />
			both the lands taken together assessed at
			<lb />
			Rs.44,032/-per annum multiplied by 25 years, i.e.,
			<lb />
			1980 to 2004. The amount being on the higher
			<lb />
			side, it ought to have been granted to the Appellant.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			In our view, the argument as regards (ii)
			<lb />
			above does not appear to be sound.
			<lb />
			The rate
			<lb />
			estimated at Rs.44,032/-per annum was fixed in
			<lb />
			terms of a notification dated 18-05-2001, Exhibit 72
			<lb />
			and, therefore, would be applicable only after that
			<lb />
			date and not before. We do not find any criteria to
			<lb />
			assess the rates prior to the one fixed by the
			<lb />
			notification dated May, 2001 as referred to in Exhibit
			<lb />
			72.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c)
			<lb />
			We also find in the records, Exhibit 170,
			<lb />
			another certificate of income issued by the Sub-
			<lb />
			Divisional Magistrate, Rabongla in respect of the land
			<lb />
			at Dew Block at Rs,3,65,208/-and Rs.64,525/-for
			<lb />
			the Sripatam land. In the first instance, it is not
			<lb />
			understood as to how there can be two different
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			assessments for the same land and secondly, we find
			<lb />
			that Exhibit 170, the second assessment which is on
			<lb />
			the lower side, does not appear to cover the entire
			<lb />
			check period but only from the year 1985 onwards.
			<lb />
			Moreover, the statements Exhibit 72 and Exhibit 170
			<lb />
			are found to be mutually conflicting particularly with
			<lb />
			regard to the income commencing from the month of
			<lb />
			May, 2001. The evidence on this is bereft of clarity.
			<lb />
			Under the circumstances, we are inclined to uphold
			<lb />
			the income conceded by the learned Special Court at
			<lb />
			Rs.13,49,633.00 in its impugned Judgment.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d)
			<lb />
			Similarly, we do not find any reason to
			<lb />
			interfere with the agriculture income accepted by the
			<lb />
			Learned Trial Court in respect of the other landed
			<lb />
			properties. The details of agricultural income will
			<lb />
			thus remain undisturbed as under: -

		<lb />
		<p>
			Against the business turnover of Hotel Reverie
			<lb />
			at Pani House, the Learned Trial Court has granted
			<lb />
			Rs.9,34,500/-based on the evidence of PW-12 and
			<lb />
			Assessment Order dated 12-05-2004 contained in the
			<lb />
			Income Tax file, Exhibit 44, pertaining to the hotel. The
			<lb />
			case of the wife of the Appellant on the other hand had
			<lb />
			been that during the period 1997-98 to 2003-04 falling
			<lb />
			within the check period, she had a gross turnover of
			<lb />
			business of Rs.20,12,333/-. In support of this, reliance
			<lb />
			was placed upon Exhibit D5, a Certificate issued by the
			<lb />
			Income Tax Department vide Letter No.383/IT dated 30-
			<lb />
			06-2007. Upon examination of these two documents, we
			<lb />
			find that the Assessment Order dated 12-05-2004
			<lb />
			contained in Exhibit 44 relied upon by the Learned Special
			<lb />
			Court, pertain only to the assessment years 2000-01 to
			<lb />
			2003-04, the gross turnover for which period was
			<lb />
			Rs.9,34,500/. On the other hand, the Certificate dated
			<lb />
			30-06-2007 issued by the Joint Secretary-II, Income Tax,
			<lb />
			Income
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			Commercial
			<lb />
			Tax
			<lb />
			Division,
			<lb />
			Finance
			<lb />
			Department, Government of Sikkim, marked Exhibit D5
			<lb />
			upon which the Appellant relies, reflects the turnover for
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			the assessment years 1997-98 to 2005-06. We also find
			<lb />
			from Exhibit D5 that the business turnover of the
			<lb />
			Appellant&apos;s wife during the period 1997-98 to 2003-04
			<lb />
			falling within the check period is Rs.16,32,000/-against
			<lb />
			Rs.20,12,333/-claimed by her which obviously appears to
			<lb />
			be on account of the erroneous inclusion of the turnover
			<lb />
			for the year 2004-05. Therefore, in our view, Smt. Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba, the wife of the Appellant, would be entitled to the
			<lb />
			benefit of gross turnover of Rs.16,32,000/-against
			<lb />
			Rs.9,34,500/-allowed by the Learned Special Judge, i.e.,
			<lb />
			additional amount of Rs.6,97,500.00.
			<lb />
			We accordingly
			<lb />
			direct so.

			(a)
			<lb />
			As observed in the earlier part of this
			<lb />
			judgment, the prosecution has proceeded on the
			<lb />
			premise that the entire assets and income set out in
			<lb />
			&quot;Statement B&quot; and &quot;Statement C&quot; of the charge-sheet
			<lb />
			as acquired and owned by the Appellant. On the
			<lb />
			other hand, the assertion on behalf of the Appellant
			<lb />
			has been that much of those are the properties of his
			<lb />
			wife, Smt. Dikila D. Subba, who had sufficient
			<lb />
			earnings of her own from different sources.
			<lb />
			On
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Apart from the above, we also find from the

			<lb />
			following: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i) One small piece of land with one

			the Department vide lease deed
			<lb />
			dated 5.1.1999.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			68.
			<lb />
			We had also noted earlier, that the buildings
			<lb />
			situated at Arithang, Pani House, Development Area,
			<lb />
			Sichey and Jorethang, constructed on the land in the
			<lb />
			foregoing paragraph, all stand recorded in the name of the
			<lb />
			wife of the Appellant and that being the owner she had
			<lb />
			been dealing with those properties independently, as
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			revealed from the documentary and the oral evidence of
			<lb />
			both the prosecution and the defence witnesses.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			69.
			<lb />
			The purchase of the landed properties at
			<lb />
			different places by Smt. Dikila Subba was disbelieved by
			<lb />
			the learned Special Judge on the ground that the Appellant
			<lb />
			had failed to furnish any document to substantiate the
			<lb />
			claim. The learned Special Judge obviously appears to
			<lb />
			have adopted a wrong approach as the findings are
			<lb />
			perverse to the various registered Sale Deeds pertaining
			<lb />
			to those lands exhibited by the prosecution as Exhibits 69,
			<lb />
			62, 54 and 71. The Sale Deeds clearly indicate the name
			<lb />
			of the purchaser as Dikila in whose favour the right of the
			<lb />
			sale would pass over by the Sale Deed Documents, so that
			<lb />
			she may possess and enjoy the said properties without
			<lb />
			any claim or objection. The entries are identical in all the
			<lb />
			Sale Deeds by which the different properties were
			<lb />
			purchased. Therefore, the very Sale Deed documents are
			<lb />
			testimony of the lands having been purchased by Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			70.
			<lb />
			It is relevant to note that it is not the case of
			<lb />
			the prosecution that the landed properties were purchased
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			by the Appellant Benami in the name of his wife, and,
			<lb />
			therefore, the question of him requiring to furnish
			<lb />
			evidence of his wife having income of her own at the
			<lb />
			relevant time for such purchase, in our view, would not at
			<lb />
			all arise. It is for the prosecution to first prove beyond
			<lb />
			reasonable doubt that it was the Appellant who had put in
			<lb />
			the money for purchase of those from his own sources
			<lb />
			and, then only the burden would shift on the Appellant.
			<lb />
			The prosecution has totally failed to discharge this initial
			<lb />
			burden. It is also relevant to note that the prosecution did
			<lb />
			not consider it necessary to examine Dikila Subba neither
			<lb />
			during investigation nor at the trial as a prosecution
			<lb />
			witness.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			71.
			<lb />
			Similarly, we find nothing on record that belie
			<lb />
			the claim of the Appellant.
			<lb />
			It has been asserted that the
			<lb />
			plot of land upon which the building at Pani House, Deorali
			<lb />
			was constructed was purchased by Dikila Subba and the
			<lb />
			consideration value for that amounting to Rs.11,000/-was
			<lb />
			paid by her brother Tsering Phintso Bhutia who appeared
			<lb />
			as DW1. This witness not only deposed on these facts but
			<lb />
			also stated that his sister Dikila Subba had constructed the
			<lb />
			building in August, 1978 cost of which was paid by her
			<lb />
			from her own funds received in the form of &apos;Daijo&apos;. That
			<lb />
			he had also helped her with building materials as he was a
			<lb />
			construction contractor at the relevant time. By the &apos;Daijo&apos;
			<lb />
			document dated 22.03.1975, marked Exhibit D7, she had
			<lb />
			been gifted with cardamom weighing 240 mounds,
			<lb />
			jewellery and cash of Rs.1,75,000.00 That he had sold
			<lb />
			the 240 mounds of cardamom for Rs.500.00 or Rs.600.00
			<lb />
			per mound and handed over the sale proceeds to his sister
			<lb />
			Dikila Subba. In 1973, during the family partition, she
			<lb />
			had also got 5 acres each of cardamom field and paddy
			<lb />
			and dry field and when she wanted to dispose of those in
			<lb />
			1977,
			<lb />
			the family had retained it on payment of
			<lb />
			Rs.5,00,000.00 to her.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			72.
			<lb />
			Dikila Subba also appeared as DW-2 and, inter
			<lb />
			alia, corroborated the evidence of DW-1 on all material
			<lb />
			particulars. She further went on to state that she had
			<lb />
			borrowed Rs.5,00,000.00 in two instalments from her
			<lb />
			cousin Topden Phintso Bhutia, DW-3, by executing a loan
			<lb />
			document Exhibit D9 in the year 1978. This amount was
			<lb />
			repaid by her in two instalments of Rs.25,000.00 and
			<lb />
			Rs.4,75,000.00. That she also constructed on her own all
			<lb />
			the four buildings with her own funds, loan taken from
			<lb />
			others by depositing her ornaments and from the rent she
			<lb />
			received from the tenants. Topden Phintso Bhutia, DW-3,
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			in his deposition corroborated the fact of him having
			<lb />
			extended the loan of Rs.5,00,000.00 to Dikila Subba vide
			<lb />
			Exhibit D9. He also confirmed of her having received
			<lb />
			assets as &apos;Daijo&apos; vide Exhibit D7 which as per him was
			<lb />
			prepared in his presence and identified his signature
			<lb />
			Exhibit D7(a) and the signature of Gyamtso Bhutia,
			<lb />
			brother of Dikila Subba, Exhibit D7(b) and the thumb
			<lb />
			impressions Exhibit D7(c) and Exhibit D7(d) of the parents
			<lb />
			of Dikila Subba. He asserted that he also had helped her
			<lb />
			in constructing the buildings by giving cement, rods, etc.,
			<lb />
			out of his contract business on loan basis.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			73.
			<lb />
			In their cross-examination, the evidence of
			<lb />
			these witnesses have remained un-demolished, firm and
			<lb />
			unshaken on all material particulars. The learned Special
			<lb />
			Court appears to have rejected this document having
			<lb />
			found it to be a carbon copy, unregistered and illegible
			<lb />
			and that the endorsement of repayments made on the
			<lb />
			reverse page have been found written in the same colored
			<lb />
			ink for the year 1984, 1986 and 1988 and further that the
			<lb />
			endorsement appears to have been made at random on
			<lb />
			one date.
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			74.
			<lb />
			On careful scrutiny and meticulous examination
			<lb />
			of the documentary exhibits, we do not find anything for
			<lb />
			us to suspect the genuineness of Exhibit D7 and D9.
			<lb />
			Although Exhibit D9 is a carbon copy, the signatures
			<lb />
			appended thereto are in original. The learned Special
			<lb />
			Judge appears to have overlooked the provisions of
			<lb />
			Sections 61 and 62 of the Evidence Act while coming to
			<lb />
			the conclusion.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			75.
			<lb />
			Section 61 provides that the contents of
			<lb />
			documents may be proved either by primary or by
			<lb />
			secondary evidence and Section 62 defines primary
			<lb />
			evidence to mean &quot;The document itself produced or the
			<lb />
			inspection of the Court&quot; and, in Explanation 1 thereto it
			<lb />
			provides that where a document is executed in sufficient
			<lb />
			parts, each part is primary evidence of the document. In
			<lb />
			Sarkar&apos;s Law of Evidence, Thirteenth Edition Explanation 1
			<lb />
			has been analysed as under: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Explanation 1
			<lb />
			: (Document Executed in
			<lb />
			Counterpart).
			<lb />
			The meaning of &quot;counterpart&quot; is
			<lb />
			&quot;duplicate&quot;; when a deed is prepared in two or more
			<lb />
			identical forms, the part signed by the grantor is the
			<lb />
			original, the other parts are counterparts [Aiyar&apos;s Law
			<lb />
			Lexison, qyuoted in Jayarama v S. Ramanatha, A1976
			<lb />
			M 147]. Where an instrument is executed by all the
			<lb />
			parties in duplicate or triplicate and each keeps one,
			<lb />
			each instrument is treated as an original and each is
			<lb />
			primary
			<lb />
			evidence
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			all
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			others.&quot;
			<lb />
			………………………………&quot;The rule which determines under
			<lb />
			what head of evidence deeds executed in duplicates
			<lb />
			are to be classed, appears to be this : -When two or
			<lb />
			more parts are sealed and delivered by each party,
			<lb />
			they are denominated as duplicate or triplicate original,
			<lb />
			and each copy is considered primary evidence [Colling
			<lb />
			v. Treweek, 6 B &amp; C 398; Brown v Woodman, 6 C &amp; P
			<lb />
			206].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			…………………………&quot;Where there are duplicate originals, ie
			<lb />
			two documents both fully executed by each party -
			<lb />
			both are considered primary evidence; in the case of
			<lb />
			counterparts -ie whre each document is fully executed
			<lb />
			by one party only -they are primary evidence against
			<lb />
			the executing party and his privies, but secondary
			<lb />
			evidence only against the non-executing party or his
			<lb />
			privies, except in cases of ancient possession.&quot;
			<lb />

		<item>
			&quot;Carbon-copies produced by type-writers may for all
			<lb />
			practicalpurposes be regarded as equivalent, though
			<lb />
			the impressions on the lower sheets are likely to be
			<lb />
			imperfect. They are produced by the same stroke
			<lb />
			which makes the surface impression. In Federal U S
			<lb />
			Co v Indian L &amp; M Co. 176 Ind 328. in the case of a
			<lb />
			machine carbon-copy in triplicate each one was held as
			<lb />
			original……………..&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			76.
			<lb />
			In the present case, Exhibit D-9 as already
			<lb />
			observed by us is a carbon-copy that contains the original
			<lb />
			signatures of all the parties. Moreover, the document is
			<lb />
			proved by DW-1, Tsering Phintso Bhutia and DW-2, Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba who are the parties who executed the document,
			<lb />
			and are firmly supported by DW-3, Topden Phintso Bhutia
			<lb />
			in his evidience who is admittedly a witness to the
			<lb />
			execution of that document. It, therefore, leaves us with
			<lb />
			no room to doubt the authenticity of the document Exhibit
			<lb />
			D-9.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			77.
			<lb />
			All the three witnesses, namely, Tsering Phintso
			<lb />
			Bhutia, DW-1, Dikila Subba, DW-2 and Topden Phintso
			<lb />
			Bhutia, DW-3 have most unequivocally stated that they
			<lb />
			had been subjected to investigation on the documents
			<lb />
			Exhibits D7 and D9 and interrogated by the Investigating
			<lb />
			Officer but admittedly those were not sent for examination
			<lb />
			by handwriting experts. Under these circumstances, we
			<lb />
			have no hesitation in accepting these documents as valid
			<lb />
			and to reasonably conclude by application of the principal
			<lb />
			of preponderance of possibilities that the building at Pani
			<lb />
			House, Deorali was indeed constructed by Smt. Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba, the wife of the Appellant with her own resources.
			<lb />
			Although the learned Special Judge in the impugned
			<lb />
			judgment has expressed doubt as regards the genuineness
			<lb />
			of Exhibit D9, no steps were taken for getting it examined
			<lb />
			by expert even at the stage of the trial.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			78.
			<lb />
			Deducing from what have been revealed in the
			<lb />
			evidence, we have no hesitation to hold that the building
			<lb />
			at Development Area also was constructed by Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba, wife of the Appellant over a site allotted to her by
			<lb />
			the Government in 1988 vide allotment order Exhibit 40.
			<lb />
			We have already noticed that the land at Sichey and
			<lb />
			Arithang were purchased by her. Her assertion that she
			<lb />
			herself had raised the four buildings in her evidence has
			<lb />
			gone uncontroverted and nothing has been brought out in
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			her cross-examination to give rise to any doubt on these
			<lb />
			facts.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			79.
			<lb />
			We have also noticed that the learned Special
			<lb />
			Judge has not accepted the document produced by the
			<lb />
			Appellant through the defence witnesses on the ground
			<lb />
			that those had not been produced by him at the stage of
			<lb />
			the investigation.
			<lb />
			Firstly, this finding of the learned
			<lb />
			special Judge appears to be factually erroneous as will be
			<lb />
			revealed from the facts stated hereafter and secondly,
			<lb />
			documentary evidence produced by an accused during the
			<lb />
			course of a trial cannot be disbelieved simply because it
			<lb />
			was not available during the investigation. There is no bar
			<lb />
			under the law for an accused to produce evidence in
			<lb />
			defence at the appropriate stage during the proceeding of
			<lb />
			the trial when Section 233(3) CrPC enables an accused to
			<lb />
			do so.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			80.
			<lb />
			We find that at the very stage of investigation,
			<lb />
			the Appellant had submitted an application dated
			<lb />
			26.03.2007, Exhibit D2 to the Inspector of Police,
			<lb />
			Vigilance Department, informing him that the properties
			<lb />
			and earnings under the heads a, b, c, d and e to Sl.No.4
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			were his wife&apos;s. We may reproduce below the relevant
			<lb />
			portion of the said application:

			4. WIFE BUSINESS :
			<lb />
			My wife, Mrs. Dikkila Subba carried out various types of
			<lb />
			business through out the last 30 years period. These
			<lb />
			businesses were briefly :
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			a. CONSTRUCTION OF PANI HOUSE HOTEL REVERIE :
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			 The Building sites was acquired in 1978.
			<lb />
			 The Building initially was rented out till
			<lb />
			1994 with :
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			 2 small flat at GF.
			<lb />
			 8 Family Flats in 1 st , 2 nd , 4 th and 5 th
			<lb />
			Floor.
			<lb />
			 3 shops at Road Level.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			 The Building was later converted into 13
			<lb />
			rooms Hotel and leased out to various
			<lb />
			parties.
			<lb />
			 Hence the Building provided earning
			<lb />
			through out the last 25 years plus.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			b. MANDAR LODGE BUILDING AT DEV.AREA :
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			The Building sites was Govt. allotted site
			<lb />
			in 1989.
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			Initially for a short period it was rented
			<lb />
			out to Private Parties and later it was
			<lb />
			leased out as a full hotel.
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			Hence through out last 15 years it
			<lb />
			provided earnings.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			c. ARITHANG BUILDING :
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			
			<lb />
			The Building sites was registered in her
			<lb />
			name.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			
			<lb />
			The Buildidng has 9 family units in three
			<lb />
			floors.
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			Since its completion it provided rental
			<lb />
			earnings.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			d. EARNINGS FROM OTHER SMALLER BUSINESSES :
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			My wife also carried out numerous smaller
			<lb />
			business and contract works, including
			<lb />
			retail business, collection of milk, running
			<lb />
			hotels on partnerships and on lease,
			<lb />
			&apos;dadani&apos; on agricultural produce, etc.
			<lb />
			These accrued her good profit.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			
			<lb />
			Therefore continuously endeavoured to
			<lb />
			improve
			<lb />
			life
			<lb />
			standard
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			entrepreneurship and hard works.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			e. EARNINGS FROM AGRICULTURAL LAND AND
			<lb />
			PERSONAL LOANS :
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			All the lands with Mrs. Dikkila Subba,
			<lb />
			yielded agricultural produce and yielded
			<lb />
			some earning in terms of cash or kind.
			<lb />
			
			<lb />
			During the span of 30 years personal
			<lb />
			loans were taken from friends and
			<lb />

			<lb />
			The receipt of the original of Exhibit D2 stands
			<lb />
			admitted by the Investigating Officer, PW-69, who did not
			<lb />
			seek any explanation from the Appellant, as will appear
			<lb />
			from the following extract of this deposition :-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;It is true that I had received the original of Exbt.D-2
			<lb />
			dated: 26.3.07. in nine pages.
			<lb />
			I have seen my
			<lb />
			signature acknowledging receipt of Exbt.D-2 in the
			<lb />
			office copy of Exbt.D-2. Exbt.D-2(a) is my signature.
			<lb />
			It is true that in Exbt.D-2 it has been written that the
			<lb />
			accused is submitting along with said exhibit six
			<lb />
			number of forms of assets and liabilities however the
			<lb />
			said six number of forms of assets and liabilities were
			<lb />
			not received by me at any point of time. It is not a
			<lb />
			fact that I had received all those formats but I am now
			<lb />
			concealing the truth in order to frustrate the genuine
			<lb />
			claim of the accused. It is true that after receipt of
			<lb />
			Exbt. D-2 dated: 26.3.2007 I had not issued any notice
			<lb />
			or showcause to the accused informing him that the
			<lb />
			enclosures namely six nos. of forms were not received
			<lb />
			by me nor any explanation as to why he did not hand
			<lb />
			over the said six nos. of formats to me even after
			<lb />
			mentioning the same in Exbt.D-2.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			( emphasis supplied )
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			83.
			<lb />
			We, therefore, are in no doubt that at the stage
			<lb />
			of investigation, the Appellant had informed the
			<lb />
			Crl.A. No. 02 of 2013
			<lb />
			Investigating Officer in most categorical terms that the
			<lb />
			properties belonged to his wife, Smt. Dikila Subba, and
			<lb />
			that the Investigating Officer did not care to enquire into
			<lb />
			that aspect. It is quite obvious that he chose to ignore all
			<lb />
			that and insisted on fixing the ownership of those
			<lb />
			properties on the Appellant. When the I.O. on his own
			<lb />
			admission had received the document Exhibit D2 from the
			<lb />
			Appellant containing nine pages, it is not understood as to
			<lb />
			why it was not filed along with his report under Section
			<lb />
			173 Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			This, in our view, surely amounts to
			<lb />
			suppression and concealment of material facts and
			<lb />
			withholding evidence, leading us to draw an adverse
			<lb />
			presumption against the prosecution. This also holds good
			<lb />
			in respect of the document Exhibit D7, i.e., the &quot;Daijo&quot;
			<lb />
			Document and Exhibit D8 i.e., the partition document
			<lb />
			pertaining to the Appellant. The finding of the learned
			<lb />
			trial Court which apparently is very cryptic on this does
			<lb />
			not appear to be convincing.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			84.
			<lb />
			It is in the evidence of Smt. Dikila Subba, DW2
			<lb />
			that she used to run a lodge named &quot;Asia Lodge&quot; on lease
			<lb />
			from Shri N. K. Pradhan, who is a Minister at present, a
			<lb />
			Hotel Meridian under Mr. Panth, presently an MLA, a
			<lb />
			garment shop at supermarket, a milk supply business and
			<lb />
			a hotel in Orissa. That she was an income tax assessee as
			<lb />
			Proprietor of Mandaar Lodge at Development Area and
			<lb />
			Hotel Reverie at Panihouse under valid trade licences
			<lb />
			under Exhibits 45 and 44 respectively. That she had also
			<lb />
			done film production named &quot;Tshango Film&quot; of which the
			<lb />
			document had been seized by the police. We find that the
			<lb />
			Investigating Officer has admitted having seized vide
			<lb />
			seizure memo Exhibit 2 a register containing 64 pages of
			<lb />
			which pages 1 to 5 pertain to &quot;Tshango&quot; income, a register
			<lb />
			with a title &quot;Film&quot; containing 9 written pages and Exhibit
			<lb />
			D-2 as has already been referred to earlier. But curiously
			<lb />
			the prosecution has also chosen not to file those
			<lb />
			documents along with the charge sheet and failed to
			<lb />
			conduct investigation on those. It is also an admitted fact
			<lb />
			that the I.O. had seized receipt of Rs.25,000.00 against
			<lb />
			lease of Asia Lodge vide item No.38 under seizure memo
			<lb />
			Exhibit 2 which also was not filed with the charge sheet
			<lb />
			and no investigation conducted towards those. We may
			<lb />
			reproduce below the relevant portion of the evidence of
			<lb />
			the I.O., PW69 :-

			<lb />

		<item>
			&quot;It is true that I had received the original of
			<lb />
			Exbt.D-2 dated 26.3.07 in nine pages. I have
			<lb />
			seen my signature acknowledging receipt of
			<lb />
			Exbt.D-2 in the office copy of Exbt.D-2, Exbt.D-
			<lb />
			2(a) is my signature. It is true that in Exbt. D-2 it
			<lb />
			has been written that the accused is submitting
			<lb />
			along with said exhibit six number of forms of
			<lb />
			assets and liabilites however the said six number
			<lb />
			of forms of assets and liabilities were not received
			<lb />
			by me at any point of time. It is not a fact that I
			<lb />
			had received all those formats but I am now
			<lb />
			concealing the truth in order to frustrate the
			<lb />
			genuine claim of the accused. It is true that after
			<lb />
			receipt of Exbt.D-2 dated : 26.3.2007 I had not
			<lb />
			issued any notice or showcause to the accused
			<lb />
			informing him that the enclosures namely six nos.
			<lb />
			of forms were not received by me nor any
			<lb />
			explanation was asked for them from the accused
			<lb />
			asking the reasons as to why he did not hand over
			<lb />
			the said six nos. of formats to me even after
			<lb />
			mentioning the same in Exbt.D-2.&quot;
			<lb />
			( emphasis supplied )
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			85.
			<lb />
			It is re-emphasised that despite such multitudes
			<lb />
			of evidence indicating the income and assets of Smt. Dikila
			<lb />
			Subba, she was not at all examined under Section 161
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. during the investigation, let alone she being made
			<lb />
			a co-accused or even charge for abatement under Section
			<lb />
			109 IPC registered against her. All these, in our view,
			<lb />
			additionally convince us of the genuineness of the claim of
			<lb />
			the wife, Smt. Dikila Subba and severely corrodes the
			<lb />
			credibility of the prosecution case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			86.
			<lb />
			In the case of Chittaranjan Chouhury vs. State of
			<lb />
			Bihar : (1987) 2 SCC 104, it has been held as follows: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;6.
			<lb />
			……………This evidence is noticed only to be
			<lb />
			rejected. In our opinion where, as in the instant case,
			<lb />
			the defence is founded on a relevant and vital
			<lb />
			document seized from the custody of the accused and
			<lb />
			not deliberately produced, it is difficult to sustain the
			<lb />
			conviction of the accused……………&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			87.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the finding of the learned trial Court
			<lb />
			that there was no proof of the wife of the Appellant
			<lb />
			having business of her own from which she had earned
			<lb />
			income does not appear to be sound.
			<lb />
			Adverse inference
			<lb />
			ought to have been drawn against the prosecution for
			<lb />
			having failed to produce the seized documents pertaining
			<lb />
			to her business and to investigate into those aspects on
			<lb />
			their own admission. This is apart from what we have
			<lb />
			already held in respect of documents Exhibit D-2, Exhibit
			<lb />
			D-7 and Exhibit D-8.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			88.
			<lb />
			We may in this regard refer to State Inspector of
			<lb />
			Police Vishakhapatnam vs. Surya Sankaram Karri : (2006) 7
			<lb />
			SCC 172 where it has been held as under :-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;18. It is now well settled that when a document
			<lb />
			being in possession of a public functionary, who is
			<lb />
			under a statutory obligation to produce the same
			<lb />
			before the court of law, fails and/or neglects to produce
			<lb />
			the same, an adverse inference may be drawn against
			<lb />
			him.
			<lb />
			The learned Special Judge in the aforesaid
			<lb />
			situation was enjoined with a duty to draw an adverse
			<lb />
			inference. He did not consider the question from the
			<lb />
			pointof view of statutory requirements, but took into
			<lb />
			consideration factors, which were not germane.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			19.
			<lb />
			Illegality apart, the manner in which the
			<lb />
			investigation was conducted, is condemnable.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			least that a court of law would expect from the
			<lb />
			prosecution is that the investigation would be a fair
			<lb />
			one. It would not only be carried out from the stand of
			<lb />
			the prosecution, but also the defence, particularly, in
			<lb />
			view of the fact that the onus of proof may shift to the
			<lb />
			accused at a later stage. The evidence of PW41 raises
			<lb />
			doubts about his bona fides. Why he did not examine
			<lb />
			important witnesses and as to why he had not taken
			<lb />
			into consideration the relevant documentary evidence
			<lb />
			has not been explained. He did not even care to
			<lb />
			ascertain the correctness or otherwise of the status of
			<lb />
			both the respondent and his wife before the Income
			<lb />
			Tax Department. Above all, he did not produce before
			<lb />
			the court the statements made by the respondent, his
			<lb />
			wife and those of his sons, although they were
			<lb />
			relevant. Had the statements of DW3 and Dw4 been
			<lb />
			produced before, the learned Special Judge might not
			<lb />
			have opined that the sons of the respondent, other
			<lb />
			than DW 2, did not make any contribution totheir
			<lb />
			parents at all. If such statements were made by the
			<lb />
			said witnesses before the investigating officer,
			<lb />
			omission on the part of DW1, the wife of the
			<lb />
			respondent, to state the same before the Special Judge
			<lb />
			might have taken a back seat and the statements of
			<lb />
			other sons of the respondent, namely, DW 3 and DW 4
			<lb />
			might not have been ignored by the learned Special
			<lb />
			Judge.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			89.
			<lb />
			On an analysis of the discussions on the &apos;daijo&apos;
			<lb />
			document, Exhibit D7, we are convinced that the wife of
			<lb />
			the Appellant, Smt. Dikila Subba, did have the following
			<lb />
			income:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(a)
			<lb />
			Cost of 240 mounds of cardamom at the
			<lb />
			average rate of Rs.550/-per mound i.e.
			<lb />
			Rs.1,32,000/-(i.e.240 mounds x Rs.550/-)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			Cost of the land of her share retained by the
			<lb />
			family Rs.5,00,000/-.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c)
			<lb />
			Ornament cash etc. valued at Rs.1,75,000/-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d)
			<lb />
			Loan of Rs.5,00,000/-received from Topden
			<lb />
			Phintso Bhutia by Loan Agreement, Exhibit
			<lb />
			D9.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			90.
			<lb />
			The Additional income of the wife will, therefore,
			<lb />
			amount to Rs.8,07,000/-(+) Rs.5,00,000/-(from her share
			<lb />
			of paternal property) = Rs.13,07,000/-. This is in addition to
			<lb />
			the income from her business and from rent already
			<lb />
			discussed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			91.
			<lb />
			Although not specifically stated in the charge
			<lb />
			sheet and no such charge having been framed, it is quite
			<lb />
			clear from the list of assets set out in the charge sheet
			<lb />
			that the prosecution has proceeded under the presumption
			<lb />
			that the income and assets of the wife are the income and
			<lb />
			assets of the Appellant, i.e., their incomes have been
			<lb />
			clubbed together and the Benami nature of the holdings
			<lb />
			of the wife and her income was inherent. This in our view
			<lb />
			is impermissible in law particularly in view of what have
			<lb />
			been discussed earlier. In DSP. Chennai vs. K. Inbasagaran
			<lb />
			: (2006)1 SCC 420 it has been held as follows: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;17. …………………….The question is, when the accused
			<lb />
			has provided satisfactory explanation that all the
			<lb />
			money belonged to his wife and she has owned it and
			<lb />
			the Income Tax Department has assessed it in her
			<lb />
			hand, then, in that case, whether he could be charged
			<lb />
			under the Preventionof Corruption Act. It is true that
			<lb />
			when threre is joint possession between the wife and
			<lb />
			husband, or father and son and if some of the
			<lb />
			members of the family are involved in amassing illegal
			<lb />
			wealth, then unless there is categorical evidence to
			<lb />
			believe, that this can be read in the hands of the
			<lb />
			husband as the case may be, it cannot be fastened on
			<lb />
			the husband or the head of the family. It is true that
			<lb />
			the prosecution in the present case has tried its best to
			<lb />
			lead evidence to show that all these monies belonged
			<lb />
			to the accused but when the wife has fully owned the
			<lb />
			entire money and the other wealth earned by her by
			<lb />
			not showing in the income tax returns and she has
			<lb />
			accepted the whole responsibility, in that case, it is
			<lb />
			very difficult to hold the accused guilty of the charge.
			<lb />
			It is very difficult to segregate that how much of the
			<lb />
			wealth belonged to the husband and how much
			<lb />
			belonged to the wife. The prosecution has not been
			<lb />
			able to lead evidence to establish that some of the
			<lb />
			money could be held in the hands of the accused. In
			<lb />
			case of joint possession it is very difficult when one of
			<lb />
			the persons accepted the entire responsibility. The
			<lb />
			wife of the accused has not been prosecuted and it is
			<lb />
			only the husband who has been charged being a public
			<lb />
			servant. In view of the explanation given by the
			<lb />
			husband and when it has been substantiated by the
			<lb />
			evidence of the wife, the other witneswses who have
			<lb />
			been produced on behalf of the accused, coupled with
			<lb />
			the fact that the ntire money has been treated in the
			<lb />
			hands of the wife and she has owned it and she has
			<lb />
			been assessed by the Income Tax Department, it will
			<lb />
			not be proper to hold the accused guilty under the
			<lb />
			Prevention of Corruption Act as his explanation appears
			<lb />
			to be plausible and justifiable. The burden is on the
			<lb />
			accused to offer plausible explanation and in the
			<lb />
			present case, he has satisfactorily explained that the
			<lb />
			whole money which has been recovered from his house
			<lb />
			does notbelong to him and that it belonged to his wife.
			<lb />
			Therefore, he has satisfactorily accounted for the
			<lb />
			recovery of the unaccounted money. Since the crucial
			<lb />
			questioin in this case was of possession and the
			<lb />
			premises in question were jointly share by the wife and
			<lb />
			the husband and the wife having accepted the entire
			<lb />
			recovery at her hand, it will be proper to hold the
			<lb />
			husband guilty…………………………………..&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			92.
			<lb />
			We may also refer to KrishnaNand Agnihotri vs.
			<lb />
			The State of Madhya Pradesh : (1977) 1 SCC 816 where facts
			<lb />
			involved are pari materia as the case at hand. It has been
			<lb />
			held as follows: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;25. The next item of assets to which we must refer is
			<lb />
			the land at Varanasi which was purchased for Rs.2500
			<lb />
			in 1956. The sale deed of this land was in the name
			<lb />
			of Shanti Devi and hence it must be presumed unless
			<lb />
			the contrary is shown by the prosecution that the land
			<lb />
			belonged to Shanti Devi in whose name it was
			<lb />
			purchased and it stood in the records of the Municipal
			<lb />
			authorities. The case of the appellant was that this
			<lb />
			land was purchased by the father of Shanti Devi for her
			<lb />
			benefit and the consideration for the sale was also
			<lb />
			provided by the father of Shanti Devi.
			<lb />
			Ramadhar
			<lb />
			Avasthi DW 22, the father of the first husband of
			<lb />
			Shanti Devi, clearly stated in his evidence that Anant
			<lb />
			Ram, the father of Shanti Devi had purchased a plot of
			<lb />
			land for Shanti Devi for Rs.2500 and this was
			<lb />
			supported by Bachhalal DW 11 who was one of the
			<lb />
			attesting witnesses to the sale deed. It is indeed
			<lb />
			difficult to see how this evidence led on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant could be brushed aside and without any
			<lb />
			evidence whatsoever led on behalf of the prosecution,
			<lb />
			it could be concluded that the purchase price of the
			<lb />
			land was paid by the appellant and that the land was
			<lb />
			purchased by the appellant in the name of Shanti Devi.
			<lb />
			We must, therefore, exclude this land in computing
			<lb />
			the total assets belonging to the appellant.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………………
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			29.
			<lb />
			There is also one further asset of Rs.6688
			<lb />
			representing the credit balance in the bank account
			<lb />
			standing in the name of Sheela Devi to which we must
			<lb />
			refer. This bank account stood in the name of Sheela
			<lb />
			Devi and hence the burden of proving that the monies
			<lb />
			in this bank account belonged to the appellant and
			<lb />
			Sheela Devi was merely his benamidar would be on the
			<lb />
			prosecution. When we turn to the evidence, we find
			<lb />
			that the prosecution has failed to discharge this
			<lb />
			burden. Beyond raising suspicion and doubt in the
			<lb />
			mind of the court, the prosecution has not been able to
			<lb />
			adduce any legal evidence of a definite character which
			<lb />
			would establish lthe benami character of this bank
			<lb />
			account. On the contrary, the evidence led on behalf
			<lb />
			of the appellant shows that Sheela Devi had means of
			<lb />
			her own.
			<lb />
			……………………………………………… We do not,
			<lb />
			therefore, think that the prosecution can be said to
			<lb />
			have established that the sum of Rs.6688 standing to
			<lb />
			the credit of this bank account belonged to the
			<lb />
			appellant. And on the same reasoning we must hold
			<lb />
			that the National Savings Certificates for Rs.65
			<lb />
			standing in the name of Sheela Devi also could not be
			<lb />
			said to be an asset belonging to the appellant, since
			<lb />
			there was no legal evidence led on behalf of the
			<lb />
			prosecution which would establish definitely that the
			<lb />
			consideration for the purchase of these National
			<lb />
			Savings Certificates was provided by the appellant.&quot;

			<lb />
			Considering the legal position set out above, we
			<lb />
			are firmly of the view that the prosecution has failed to
			<lb />
			establish that the entire property including those standing
			<lb />
			in the name of the wife, Dikila Subba, DW-2 is the Benami
			<lb />
			property of the Appellant. Under such circumstances, the
			<lb />
			very basis of the prosecution case against the Appellant
			<lb />
			would not sustain.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			In State of M.P. vs. Awadh Kishore Gupta and
			<lb />
			others, reported in (2004) 1 SCC 691, while explanining
			<lb />
			the explanation appended to Clause (e) of sub-section (1)
			<lb />
			of Section 13, P.C. Act, 1988, it has been held that the
			<lb />
			explanation has relieved the prosecution of the burden of
			<lb />
			investigating into &quot;source of income&quot; of an accused to a
			<lb />
			large extent, as it is stated in the explanation that &quot;kown
			<lb />
			sources of income&quot; means income received from any
			<lb />
			lawful source, the receipt of which has been intimated in
			<lb />
			accordance with the provisions of any law, rules, orders
			<lb />
			for the time being applicable to a public servant and that
			<lb />
			the expression &quot;known sources of income&quot; has reference
			<lb />
			to sources known to the prosecution after thorough
			<lb />
			investigation of the case. The evidence on record does
			<lb />
			not suggest that in accordance with provisions of any law,
			<lb />
			rules, orders applicable to the appellant or to his wife,
			<lb />
			they or any of them was required to give any intimation.
			<lb />
			In any event, no reliance was placed on any such
			<lb />
			intimation. It was only in course of search and seizure,
			<lb />
			documents suggesting receipt by appellant and his wife
			<lb />
			had come to light.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			94.
			<lb />
			In any case, the valuation of the four buildings
			<lb />
			which together constitute Rs.36,60,449.00 ought to be
			<lb />
			deleted from the value of the Appellant&apos;s assets
			<lb />
			considering the serious flaw in the evidence of the
			<lb />
			prosecution in arriving at those as discussed in extenso
			<lb />
			earlier.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			95.
			<lb />
			Consequently, Rs. 36,60,449.00 which is the
			<lb />
			value of all the buildings shall stand deleted from the
			<lb />
			head &quot;Assets during the close of the Check Period&quot;
			<lb />
			thereby reducing its total value from Rs. 74,37,253.73 as
			<lb />
			worked out by the learned Special Judge, to
			<lb />
			Rs.37,76,804.73.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			96.
			<lb />
			The rest of the calculations on the value of the
			<lb />
			assets at the beginning of the check period, expenditure
			<lb />
			and income during the check period remaining the same,
			<lb />
			the detailed calculations would then read as under: -

			Notwithstanding the above position, more

			buildings, even if we proceed under the assumption that
			<lb />
			the valuations are valid and acceptable, we have found
			<lb />
			that the Appellant has been denied of a large number of

		<p>
			Therefore, the Appellant being obviously in

		<p>
			99.
			<lb />
			So far as findings on the other items that have
			<lb />
			been questioned on behalf of the Appellant, namely, GPF
			<lb />
			withdrawal, arrears of salary, assets at the beginning of
			<lb />
			the check period, we do not see any substantial reason to
			<lb />
			interefere with those.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			100.
			<lb />
			Having come to this finding, we do not feel it
			<lb />
			necessary to go into other aspects raised on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Appellant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			101.
			<lb />
			Therefore, considering the prosecution case on
			<lb />
			all accounts, we have no hesitation to hold that they have
			<lb />
			failed to prove the case as required under law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			102.
			<lb />
			For the reasons stated above, the Appeal
			<lb />
			succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned judgment
			<lb />
			and sentence are hereby quashed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			103.
			<lb />
			Consequently, the Appellant is acquitted of the

			charges and is released from bail.

			No order as to costs.
