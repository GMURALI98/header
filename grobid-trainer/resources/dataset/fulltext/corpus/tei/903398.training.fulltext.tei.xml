			<head>FACTUAL MATRIX<lb/></head>

			<p>2.<lb/> Brief facts of the case are that the instant FIR bearing No. 12/2008<lb/> dated 22 nd October, 2008 was registered at Police Station Crime Branch,<lb/> Delhi against Mr. Davinder Sharma, Mrs. Seema Sharma, Mr. Sanjay<lb/> Kriplani, Mr. Baljit Singh, Mr. Kuldeep Singh and Mr. Hari Om Yadav for<lb/> the offence of extortion of more than Rs. 100 crores by way of putting the<lb/> complainant and his wife in fear of death. It is contended in the instant FIR<lb/> that the complainant, Mr. Harbhajan Singh Chopra and his wife Mrs. Surjit<lb/> Kaur Chopra are the Directors of &apos;Hotel Fountain Head Motel Pvt.

It is<lb/> contended that few years back, the complainant came back to India and<lb/> invested his lifelong earned money into &quot;Hotel Fountain Head Motel Pvt.<lb/> Ltd./Hotel Claremont&quot; and other properties in and around Delhi. It is further<lb/> contended that one Mr. Davinder Sharma/alleged accused and his wife Mrs.<lb/> Seema Sharma, whom they met in the month of September/October, 2007<lb/> through some of their common friends, started extending good gestures and<lb/> develop a good rapport with them. The complainant was lured by<lb/> misrepresentation and assurance to assist in expanding the operations of the<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> hotel. It is contended that the aforesaid accused persons along with their<lb/> criminal conspirators had forced, coerced under threat of life and physical<lb/> harm upon the complainant and his wife, and by way of such threats on gun<lb/> point, had forced them to sign various documents and cheques for the<lb/> purpose of creating liability on the company in their favour. It is further<lb/> contended that under the threat, the complainant has given certain cheques,<lb/> demand drafts/post dated cheques, cash and also executed sale deed in<lb/> favour of the accused persons. They had provided some details of the<lb/> transactions in the FIR itself. It is contended that crores of amounts have<lb/> been credited in the account of Baljeet Singh for no rhymes or reason<lb/> except the false documentation. Apart from the transactions which were<lb/> given in the FIR, there are several other transactions which are a matter of<lb/> the record. The complainants are living under threat of the aforesaid<lb/> accused persons. On the aforesaid FIR, the investigating agency has<lb/> completed the investigation and filed the charge-sheet against the accused<lb/> persons on 23 rd April, 2013.<lb/></p>

			<head>SUBMISSIONS<lb/> On behalf of the Petitioners:<lb/></head>

			<p>3.<lb/> Mr. Maninder Singh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of<lb/> the petitioners submitted that on 21 st December, 2009, respondent no. 2<lb/> through respondents no. 3 &amp; 4 filed a Recovery Suit bearing no. CS (OS)<lb/> No. 2471/2009 before the Hon&quot;ble High Court of Delhi against the<lb/> petitioner no. 1 on the ground that the loan agreement was a forged and<lb/> fabricated document and was obtained under duress and coercion, therefore,<lb/> is liable to be declared null and void.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> Learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that vide order<lb/> dated 1 st June, 2010, the matter was referred to the Delhi High Court<lb/> Mediation and Conciliation Centre on the request of respondent nos. 3 and<lb/> 4 and petitioner no. 1 in the aforesaid suit i.e. CS (OS) No. 2471/2009.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> It is submitted that respondent nos. 2 to 4 and petitioner no. 1 entered<lb/> into a settlement agreement after extensive mediation sessions in the Delhi<lb/> High Court Mediation Centre on 11 th June, 2010, 25 th June, 2010 and 8 th<lb/> July, 2010. It is submitted that the parties entered into the settlement<lb/> agreement on 8 th July, 2010, and signed the same voluntarily and on their<lb/> own free will, in the presence of the Mediator/Conciliator. As per the<lb/> settlement agreement, the respondent no. 2 through respondents no. 3 and 4<lb/> agreed to pay Rs. 5,50,00,000/-as full and final payment against the claim<lb/> of Rs. 7,76,00,000/-to petitioner no. 1. Out of Rs. 5,50,00,000/-, Rs.<lb/> 1,00,00,000/-has been paid by respondent no. 2 to petitioner no. 1 vide<lb/> Cheque No. 125349 dated 27 th September, 2010 drawn on Corporation<lb/> Bank.

It was also agreed that both parties will withdraw all the pending<lb/> litigation and complaints which had been instituted by them against each<lb/> other. In view of the aforesaid agreement, the petitioner no. 1 withdrew his<lb/> police complaints against respondents no. 2 to 4 in Police Station Mehrauli,<lb/> Delhi; before Crime Branch, Qutab Institutional Area, New Delhi; before<lb/> EOW Crime Branch, Haryana; and a Complaint filed under Section 138 of<lb/> the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act), pending before learned<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> Metropolitan Magistrate, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi. It is submitted that the<lb/> obligations of respondents No. 3 and 4 in the said MOU, were to withdraw<lb/> suit bearing no. CS (OS) No. 2471/2009 and to get the impugned FIR<lb/> quashed.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> Learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that on 5 th<lb/> October, 2010, petitioner no. 1 and respondent no. 3 got their respective<lb/> statements recorded before the Joint Registrar of this Court. The Coordinate<lb/> Bench of this Court vide order dated 24 th November, 2010, in CS (OS)<lb/> 2471/2009 observed that there was nothing illegal in the settlement arrived<lb/> at between the parties and accepting the same the matter was disposed of.<lb/> On 25 th January, 2011, the respondents no. 3 and 4 filed an application in<lb/> CS (OS) No. 2471/2009 for return of their Court fee from the Collector<lb/> which was accordingly allowed.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> It is submitted that on 27 th January, 2011, petitioner no. 2 received a<lb/> notice under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. issued by Crime Branch, Police<lb/> Station Sunlight Colony, New Delhi to join investigation in the impugned<lb/> FIR. In the month of April, 2011, the petitioner no. 2 filed a Contempt<lb/> Petition bearing No. CCP(O) No. 21/2011 in CS (OS) No. 2471/2009. The<lb/> petitioner no. 1 filed an execution petition bearing No. Ex. P. No. 179/2011<lb/> against respondent no. 2 and the Coordinate Bench of this Court ordered<lb/> warrants of attachment against respondent no. 2.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> It is further submitted that on 1 st August, 2011, the petitioners and<lb/> respondents no. 2 to 4 entered into a second MOU and the same was<lb/> registered before the Sub Registrar, Mehrauli, New Delhi. As per the MOU<lb/> dated 1 st August, 2011, it was agreed that respondent no. 3 shall file an<lb/> affidavit before the concerned Police Station for quashing of the impugned<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/></p>

			<p>FIR. It was further agreed that respondent no. 3 shall withdraw the<lb/> application for recalling order dated 24 th November, 2010 in CS (OS) No.<lb/> 2471/2011. The respondent no. 3 undertook to fully co-operate in all<lb/> possible respects with the petitioners for the purpose of quashing of the<lb/> impugned FIR. For this purpose, respondent no. 3 undertook to depose on<lb/> affidavit(s) before this Court for getting the impugned FIR quashed and<lb/> would make appropriate statements for the discharge of the petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> Learned senior counsel for the petitioners vehemently submitted that<lb/> respondents no. 3 and 4 signed and attested their counter affidavits in which<lb/> they have categorically stated that they did not want to pursue the impugned<lb/> FIR against the petitioners herein. Respondents no. 2 to 4 also moved an<lb/> application bearing CRL. M. A. No. 9400/2011 in CRL. M. C. No.<lb/> 1396/2011 pursuant to the MOU dated 1 st August, 2011, acknowledging the<lb/> said MOU, stating therein that they do not wish to pursue the impugned FIR<lb/> against the petitioners herein. On 10 th August, 2011, the petitioner no. 1<lb/> withdrew the Execution Petition against respondent no. 2.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. It is further submitted that from the above facts and circumstances,<lb/> the only question of law which remains to be decided is whether<lb/> respondents no. 3 and 4 can be permitted to retract from two formal dispute<lb/> resolutions at their whims and fancies, thereby, making a mockery of the<lb/> legal system and the Mediation Centres.<lb/></p>

			<p>11. In support of his arguments, learned senior counsel for the petitioners<lb/> has relied upon the judgment of Dalbir Singh vs. State &amp; Ors., Crl. M. C.<lb/> No. 1852/2011, passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court, relying on<lb/> the landmark Judgment of the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court titled, &quot;Md. Shamim<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> &amp; Ors, vs. Smr. Nahid Begum &amp; Anr.&quot;, (2005) 3 SCC 302, has observed<lb/> the following:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;18. This issue is not res integra. The same has been settled<lb/> by the Apex court in a case of Md. Shamim &amp; Ors, vs. Smr.<lb/> Nahid Begum &amp; Anr., (2005) 3 SCC 302, has observed as<lb/> under: -<lb/></item>

			<item>11. … before us, there is no denial or dispute as<lb/> regard that factum of entering into the<lb/> aforementioned settlement dated 14.11.2022. in the<lb/> said deed of compromise, it has categorically been<lb/> averred that the same had been entered into on the<lb/> intervention of S.N Gupta, Additional Sessions<lb/> Judge, Delhi. It has also been accepted that out of<lb/> sum of Rs. 2,75,000/-, a sum of Rs. 2,25,000/-has<lb/> been paid to the First Respondent herein and the<lb/> balance amount of Rs. 50,000/-would be paid at the<lb/> time of complainant&apos;s making statement and no<lb/> objection for quashing the FIR, which was retained<lb/> in the court as per the direction of the court. It has<lb/> further been averred that no dispute remained<lb/> between the parties regarding the payment of dower<lb/> amount (Mehar), dowry articles, including the<lb/> alleged jewellery gift, etc.<lb/></item>

			<item>12. In view of the fact that the settlement was<lb/> arrived at the intervention of a judicial officer of the<lb/> rank of the Additional Sessions Judge, we are of the<lb/> opinion, the contention of the First Respondent<lb/> herein to the effect that she was not aware of the<lb/> contents thereof and the said agreement as also the<lb/> affidavit which were got signed by her by<lb/> misrepresentation of facts must be rejected. In the<lb/> facts and circumstances of this case, we have no<lb/> doubt in our mind that the denial of execution of the<lb/> said deed of settlement is an afterthought on part of<lb/> the Respondent No. 1 herein.<lb/></item>

			<item>CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/></item>

			<item>13. Ex facie the settlement between the parties<lb/> appears to be genuine. If the contention of the First<lb/> Respondent herein is to be accepted, she would not<lb/> have accepted the sum of Rs.2,25,000/-and in any<lb/> even she could have filed an appropriate application<lb/> in that behalf before the Court of S.N Gupta,<lb/> Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi. What was least<lb/> expected of her was that she would return the said<lb/> sum of Rs. 2,25,000/-to the Appellants herein.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>12. It is apposite to mention here that respondents no. 3 &amp; 4 have never<lb/> filed any Civil Suit to declare the Settlement Agreement dated 8 th July,<lb/> 2010 and MOU dated 1 st August, 2011, null and void. They reaped all the<lb/> benefits of the settlement and created hurdles for the Petitioners to settle<lb/> their personal scores with Respondent No. 2.<lb/></item>

			<item>13. It is submitted that the Coordinate Bench of this Court in Para 4 of<lb/> the Judgment Naresh Chand Jain &amp; Anr. vs. KM Tayal, CM (M) No.<lb/></item>

			<item>1405/2009, dated 23 rd February, 2012, has observed that:-<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;4. … Section 89 was introduced into the Code (Code of Civil<lb/> Procedure, 1908) by the amendment of 2002; the legislative<lb/> intent was to encourage settlement of disputes through the<lb/> mechanism of Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR); Section<lb/> 89 (2) provides that where the dispute has been referred for<lb/> mediation, the Court shall effect a compromise between the<lb/> parties and shall follow such procedure as may be<lb/> prescribed. Rules 24 &amp; 25 of the Mediation and Conciliation<lb/> Rules, 2004 also stipulates the manner in which the<lb/> settlement has to be recorded and after the settlement has<lb/> been recorded .i.e. on the receipt of settlement, the Court, if<lb/> satisfied that the parties have settled their disputes, shall pass<lb/> a decree in accordance thereof. …&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>14. It is submitted that in the present petition, the settlement between<lb/> petitioner no. 1 and respondents no. 2 to 4 took place before the Delhi High<lb/> Court Mediation Centre. In CS (OS) No. 2471/2009 filed by Respondent<lb/> No. 3, the mediation was extensive and took place from 1 st June, 2010 to 8 th<lb/> July, 2010 and finally on 8 th July, 2010, the MOU was entered into by the<lb/> parties voluntarily, in the presence of the Mediators, and without any force,<lb/> duress or coercion. The petitioners pursuant to the said MOU, complied<lb/> with all their obligations but respondents no. 3 and 4, for their ulterior<lb/> motives and illegal gains, have been opposing the quashing of the<lb/> impugned FIR to extort illegal money from the petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. It is submitted that not only this, a second MOU dated 1 st August,<lb/> 2011 was also executed and registered before the Sub-Registrar, Mehrauli,<lb/> New Delhi, between the petitioners and respondents no. 2 to 4. But again,<lb/> respondents no. 2 to 4 have tried to wriggle out of the same. The whole<lb/> purpose and import of Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,<lb/> (hereinafter &apos;CPC&apos;) would be frustrated, if settlements arrived at between the<lb/> parties by their own free will and consent are permitted to be withdrawn<lb/> and allowed to be given a go by. In fact, the settlement arrived at in the<lb/> Delhi High Court Mediation Centre is a legal process and terms and<lb/> conditions of such process are binding on both the parties.<lb/></p>

			<p>16. The Courts have also held that once disputes are settled by the<lb/> process of mediation, it would be in the public interest as well as to attach<lb/> importance to such a process and treat the settlement as solemn settlement,<lb/> otherwise, the movement of mediation may itself suffer, if the parties are<lb/> given to understand that even after they agree for settlement, one of the<lb/> parties can still back out/ resile.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. It is therefore submitted that the FIR as well as criminal prosecution<lb/> emanating therefrom, has been quashed by the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court and<lb/> by this Court in various cases where the complainant has tried to wriggle<lb/> out of any such settlement. Moreover, in cases where the complainant has<lb/> enjoyed benefits out of the MOU, the Courts have not hesitated to quash<lb/> such criminal proceedings.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. In view of the above facts and circumstances, it is urged that the<lb/> entire criminal proceedings initiated against the petitioners is nothing but a<lb/> gross misuse of process of law and also since the disputes between the<lb/> parties have already been settled twice and MOUs have been signed by the<lb/> respondents and petitioners for quashing of the criminal cases and other<lb/> pending cases against each other, the instant FIR and the charge-sheet may<lb/> be quashed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Submissions on behalf of the Respondents:<lb/></head>

			<p>19. Mr. Anupam Lal Das, learned senior counsel for the respondents<lb/> vehemently opposed the submissions and contentions made by the learned<lb/> senior counsel for the petitioners and submitted that respondents no. 3 and 4<lb/> were held captive under house arrest by one Mr. Krishan Kumar along with<lb/> other accused persons and a lot of documents were signed by the<lb/> respondents no. 3 and 4 under coercion and undue influence of the above-<lb/>named persons. Therefore, it is wrong to say that the MOUs signed by the<lb/> respondents were on their own free will and without pressure.<lb/> 20. Learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that since the<lb/> respondents no. 3 and 4 were the ones who got the present FIR registered<lb/> and filed for the suit for cancellation of coerced loan agreements, then there<lb/> was no need or requirement for the respondents no. 3 and 4 to pay Rs. 5.50<lb/> Crores to the petitioners accused persons to settle the disputes. The fact that<lb/> mediation agreement is patently flawed and coerced will be borne out of the<lb/> fact that the respondent no. 4 was a major and equal shareholder in<lb/> respondent no. 2 Company along with respondent no. 3, was neither present<lb/> at the time of execution of the agreement and nor was a signatory to it. It is<lb/> also important to note that petitioner no. 2/Kuldeep Singh was also missing<lb/> from the said agreement as he was holding respondent no. 4 in captivity and<lb/> hostage and the respondent no. 3 was forcefully sent to sign the said<lb/> agreement before the Delhi High Court Mediation Centre.<lb/></p>

			<p>21. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the respondent<lb/> no. 2 company was not a signatory to the said agreement, moreover, no<lb/> board resolution was passed or authority letter was sanctioned for signing<lb/> the agreement for the Company. Thus, creating a serious doubt over the<lb/> validity of the settlement agreement, as the signatures of the respondents<lb/> no. 2 and•3 were conspicuously missing from the settlement, which is not<lb/> only a mandatory requirement but also essential for the said document to be<lb/> a legally sustainable document. Hence, the said settlement has no legal<lb/> enforceability and is non-est in the eyes of law.<lb/></p>

			<p>CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/></p>

			<p>22. It is submitted that in the past, a lot of illegally unsustainable<lb/> settlements were being executed where the parties were arm-twisted to<lb/> settle the dispute by the aggressor. Since there was no requirement of<lb/> validation of MOU by a committee before the Mediation Centre, the same<lb/> has been required to be mandatory after the directions of this Court in the<lb/> matter of Vinod Kumar and Others &amp; Govt of NCT of Delhi &amp; Anr., Crl.<lb/> M.C. 4286/2019:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;… As observed vide order dated 17.01.2020 in<lb/> Crl.M.C.214/2020, the learned trial Courts making reference<lb/> to mediation proceedings ought to take into account the<lb/> guidelines laid down in Afcons Infrastructure Limited &amp;<lb/> Another v. Cherian Varkey Construction Company Private<lb/> Limited; (2010) 8 SCC 24 as well as the guidelines laid<lb/> downby this Court in Yashpal Chaudhrani &amp; Ors. v. State<lb/> (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) and Another 2019 SCC OnLine Del<lb/> 8179 whereby it has been observed to the effect that:<lb/></item>

			<item>67. This Court is of the firm view that before making a<lb/> reference to mediation in the context of criminal case, the<lb/> court must consider as to whether a settlement reached by such<lb/> effort would be acceptable for the criminal process to be<lb/> brought to an end.<lb/> (emphasis supplied)<lb/> ……………………….<lb/></item>

			<item>71. To sum up, this Court is of the considered opinion that<lb/> there has to be circumspection at all stages and: (i) The court<lb/> while considering reference of the parties to a criminal case to<lb/> mediation must before even ascertaining as to whether<lb/> elements of settlement exist first examine, by preliminary<lb/> scrutiny, the permissibility in Jaw for the criminal action to be<lb/> brought to an end either because the offence involved &apos;is<lb/> compoundable or because the High Court would have no<lb/> inhibition to quash it, bearing in mind the broad principles<lb/> that govern the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> Cr.P.C. (ii) The mediator (before commencing mediation) must<lb/> undertake a preliminary scrutiny of the facts of the criminal<lb/> case and satisfy himself as to the possibility of assisting the<lb/> parties to such a settlement as would be acceptable to the<lb/> court, bearing in mind the law governing the compounding of<lb/> the offences or exercise of power of the High Court under<lb/> Section 482 Cr.P.C For this, an institutional mechanism has to<lb/> be created in the mediation centers so that there is consistency<lb/> and uniformity in approach. The scrutiny in above nature<lb/> would also need to be undertaken, as the mediation process<lb/> continues, should any such criminal case, as mentioned above,<lb/> be brought on the table by the parties (for being included in<lb/> the settlement), as takes it beyond the case initially referred.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) The system of vetting, at the conclusion of the mediation<lb/> process, needs to be institutionalized so that before a<lb/> settlement vis-a-vis a criminal case is formally executed by the<lb/> parties, satisfaction ls reached that the criminal charge<lb/> involved is one which is either compoundable or one<lb/> respecting which there would be no inhibition felt by the High<lb/> Court in exercise of its inherent power under Section 482 of<lb/> Cr.P.C bearing in mind the relevant Jurisprudence.<lb/></item>

			<item>72. It is hoped and expected that the criminal courts, and<lb/> the mediation centres shall abide by the above guidelines in<lb/> future. It may be added that the above would equally apply<lb/> mutatis mutandis to the other ADR methods.&quot;<lb/> The learned trial Courts are thus directed to adhere to<lb/> the law at the time of making referral of cases to Mediation<lb/> especially in relation to non-compoundable offences involving<lb/> gross allegations of mental depravity against the accused<lb/> persons. The petition is disposed of accordingly.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>23. It is submitted that the accused petitioners along with Krishan Kumar<lb/> realized their mistake and another settlement agreement dated 1 st August,<lb/> 2011 was coerced and illegally executed under the supervision of Krishan<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> Kumar, who stood as a witness and on the same terms and condition as<lb/> were mentioned in MOU dated 8 th July, 2010 before the High Court<lb/> Mediation Centre. The accused petitioner Kuldeep Singh was also made<lb/> party to this new settlement. It is categorically stated in the present petition<lb/> that if the settlement fails then the case will be fought on its own merits.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. Learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that on 28 th<lb/> March, 2011, another MOU was signed between the accused Devender<lb/> Sharma, Krishan Kumar, and Respondent Nos. 3 and 4, wherein it was<lb/> categorically admitted that the disputed property was valued at about Rs.<lb/> 110 crores. That as such, no person of sound mind would give 76%<lb/> shareholdings in the Respondent No. 2 company for a mere sum of Rs. 6.6<lb/> crores, which was never transferred to the shareholders respondents nos. 3<lb/> and 4 but were transferred to the company which was taken over by Krishan<lb/> Kumar on the very same day. Thus, it was a sham transfer and the money<lb/> went from one pocket to the pocket of Krishan Kumar and the respondents<lb/> No. 2 Company was taken over by Krishan Kumar without paying a dime<lb/> to the respondent nos.3 and 4. That to this effect a Civil Suit bearing no.<lb/> CS(OS) 299/2012 is currently pending before the learned ADJ, Saket Court,<lb/> New Delhi.<lb/></p>

			<p>25. It is submitted that as stated above the MOU dated 8 th July, 2010 and<lb/> the outside Court settlement dated 1 st August, 2011 are documents created<lb/> under coercion and undue influence for which the issue can be decided by<lb/> the Trial Court on merit and no relief can be granted in the quashing<lb/> petition for the facts and circumstances mentioned herein above. It is<lb/> informed that the quashing petition of accused Devender Sharma bearing<lb/> CRL. MC No.1981/2013 was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 6 th<lb/> August, 2015 passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court, wherein also<lb/> several coerced and under threat MOUs and deeds of settlements were<lb/> entered into with the respondents no. 3 and 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>26. Learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that even an<lb/> application under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. is pending before the<lb/> competent court for registration of FIR against Krishan Kumar.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. It is vehemently submitted that serious allegations of extortions,<lb/> cheating, fraud, forgery are leveled against the petitioners along with<lb/> Devender Sharma and others. The further investigation is also pending.<lb/> Thus, it is not a fit case where this Hon&quot;ble Court ought to appreciate<lb/> evidence for which the Trial Court is the designated Court. It is submitted<lb/> that the present matter is pending since the year 2011 and the prayer for<lb/> quashing of FIR was made at that time, however, the charge-sheet was filed<lb/> on 23 rd April, 2013 and as such, the present petition seeking quashing of<lb/> FIR has now become infructuous and the remedy available to the accused<lb/> persons is to argue before the Trial Court at the time of argument on charge.<lb/></p>

			<p>28. It is pertinent to mention that the respondents no. 3 and 4 specifically<lb/> assert that the agreements on the basis of which the quashing petition has<lb/> been filed, is signed by the Respondent No. 3 and has been signed by him<lb/> under duress and coercion. It is further submitted that the settlement<lb/> agreement dated 8 th July, 2010 clearly states the force and threat, coercion<lb/> etc. under which the respondents no. 3 and 4 signed the agreement. The said<lb/> agreement states that the respondent Nos. 3 and 4 are withdrawing all the<lb/> cases against the petitioners herein and paying amount of Rs. 5.50 crores.<lb/> There has been no settlement of disputes as sought to be portrayed by the<lb/> said agreements. It is prayed that the FIR as well as the charge-sheet should<lb/> not be quashed by this Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>29. It is submitted that the petitioners herein are land grabbers and<lb/> history sheeters and multiple heinous criminal cases are registered against<lb/> them in the State of NCT of Delhi and State of U.P. in addition to the<lb/> present FIR. The petitioners themselves in the quashing petition have not<lb/> made averments of having clean antecedents. The following are the list of<lb/> few cases in Delhi reflecting the past antecedents of the accused<lb/> Petitioners:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Where it appears to the Court that there exist elements of<lb/> a settlement which may be acceptable to the parties, the<lb/> Court shall formulate the terms of settlement and give<lb/> them to the parties for their observations and after<lb/> receiving the observations of the parties, the Court may<lb/> reformulate the terms of a possible settlement and refer the<lb/> same for:-a) arbitration b)conciliation c) Judicial<lb/> settlement including settlements through lok Adalat or d)<lb/> mediation.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The settlement in question is a settlement where one party was<lb/> forced and coerced to sign the said settlement agreement. It is pertinent<lb/> to mention that the criminal courts are not bound by the law laid down<lb/> in CPC and the same is rectified by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in many<lb/> judgments. In this regard reliance was placed on decisions of the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Karam Chand Ganga Prasad v. Union of<lb/> India, (1970) 3 SCC 694 &amp; KG. Premshankercase (2002) 8SCC 87.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. Learned senior counsel for the respondents further submitted that in<lb/> Kaptan Singh v. State of U.P., (2021) 9 SCC 35, the Hon&quot;ble Supreme<lb/> Court held that :<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;9.1 At the outset it is required to be noted that in the present<lb/> case the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 482<lb/> Cr PC has quashed the criminal proceedings for the offences<lb/> under Sections 14 7, 148, 149, 406,329 and 386 IPC. It is<lb/> required to be noted that when the High Court in exercise of<lb/> powers under Section 482 CrPC quashed the criminal<lb/> proceedings, by the time the investigating officer after<lb/> recording the statement of the witness, statement of the<lb/> complainant and collecting the evidence from the incident<lb/> place and after taking statement of the independent witnesses<lb/> and even statement of the accused persons, has filed the<lb/> charge-sheet before the learned Magistrate for the offences<lb/> under Sections 14 7, 148, 149, 406, 329 and 386 IPC and even<lb/> the learned Magistrate also took the cognizance .If the petition<lb/> under Section 482CrPC was at the stage of FIR in that case<lb/> the allegations in the FIR/complaint only are required to be<lb/> considered and whether a cognizable offence is disclosed or<lb/> not is required to be considered. However, thereafter when the<lb/> statements are recorded, evidence is collected and the charge-<lb/>sheet is filed after conclusion of the investigation/inquiry the<lb/> matter stands on different footing and the Court is required to<lb/> consider the material/evidence collected during the<lb/> investigation. Even at this stage also, as observed and held by<lb/> this Court in a catena of decisions, the High Court is not<lb/> required to go into the merits of the allegations and/or enter<lb/> into the merits of the case as if the High Court is exercising the<lb/> appellate jurisdiction and/or conducting the trail. As held by<lb/> this Court in Dineshbhai Chnadubhai v. State of Gujrat (2018)<lb/> 3 SCC 104 : (2018) 1 SCC (Crl) 683] in order to examine as to<lb/> whether factual contents of the FIR disclose any cognizable<lb/> offence or not, the High Court cannot act like the investigating<lb/> agency nor can exercise power like an appellate court. It sis<lb/> further observed and held that the question is required to be<lb/> examined keeping in view, the contents of FIR and prima facie<lb/> material, if any, requiring no proof. At such stage, the High<lb/> Court cannot appreciate evidence nor it can draw its own<lb/> inferences from contents of the FIR and material relied on. It is<lb/> further observed it is more so, when the material relied on is<lb/> disputed. It is further observed that in such a situation, it<lb/> becomes the job of an investigating authority at such to stage a<lb/> probe and then the Court should examine questions once the<lb/> chargesheet is filed along with such material as to how far and<lb/> to what extent reliance can be placed on such a material.<lb/></item>

			<item>9.2 In Dhruvaram Murlidhar Sonar v. State of Maharashtra,<lb/> (2019) 18 SCC 191 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 672 after considering<lb/> the decisions of this Court in Bhajan Lal {State of Haryana v.<lb/> Bhajan Lal 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335: 1992 SCC (Cri) 426}, it is<lb/> held by this Court that exercise of powers under Section 482<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> CrPC to quash the proceedings is an exception and not a rule.<lb/> It is further observed that inherent jurisdiction under Section<lb/> 482 CrPC though wide is to be exercised sparingly, carefully<lb/> and with caution, only when such exercise is justified by tests<lb/> specifically laid down in the section itself. It is further<lb/> observed that appreciation of evidence is not permissible at the<lb/> stage of quashing of proceedings in exercise of powers under<lb/> Section 482 CrPC Similar view has been expressed by this<lb/> Court in Arvind Khanna CBI v. Arvind Khanna, (2019) 10<lb/> SCC 686, referred to hereinabove.<lb/> ***<lb/></item>

			<item>12. Therefore, the High Court has grossly erred in quashing<lb/> the criminal proceedings by entering into the merits of the<lb/> allegations as if the High Court was exercising the appellate<lb/> jurisdiction and/or conducting the trial. The High Court has<lb/> exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the criminal proceedings<lb/> in exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>32. It is submitted that in State of Odisha v. Pratima Mohanty Etc.,<lb/> 2021 SCC Online SC 1222, the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court held that:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;14. At the outset, it is required to be noted that by the<lb/> impugned judgment and order the High Court in exercise of its<lb/> powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has quashed the criminal<lb/> proceedings for the offences under Section 13(2) read with<lb/> Section 13(1)(d) of the Act and Section 420 read with Section<lb/> 120B IPC. From the impugned judgment and order passed by<lb/> the High Court, it appears that the High Court has entered into<lb/> the merits of the allegations and has conducted the mini-trial by<lb/> weighing the evidence in detail which, as such, as observed and<lb/> held by this Court in a catena of decisions is wholly<lb/> impermissible. As held by this Court in the case of State of<lb/> Haryana v. Ch. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : AIR 1992<lb/> SC 604, the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. could be<lb/> exercised either to prevent an abuse of process of any court<lb/> and/or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In the said<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> decision this Court had carved out the exceptions to the general<lb/> rule that normally in exercise of powers under Section 482<lb/> Cr.P.C. the criminal proceedings/FIR should not be quashed.…<lb/> ***<lb/></item>

			<item>22. While quashing the criminal proceedings the High Court<lb/> has not at all adverted to itself the aforesaid aspects and has<lb/> embarked upon an enquiry as to the reliability and genuineness<lb/> of the evidence collected during the investigation as if the High<lb/> Court was conducting the mini-trial. Therefore, as such the<lb/> impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court<lb/> quashing the criminal proceedings against the respondents herein<lb/> -original accused Nos. 4, 5 and 3 -Smt. Pratima Mohanty,<lb/> Shri Prakash Chandra Patra and Shri Rajendra Kumar Samal<lb/> is unsustainable,both, in law and/or facts and the same<lb/> deserves to be quashed and set aside.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>33. It is submitted that in Satyendra Kumar Jain &amp; Anr. V. State and<lb/> Anr. In Crl.M.C No. 5553-54/2006, dated 1 st July 2010, coordinate bench<lb/> of this Court has stated that:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;17. The Respondents also submit that once a charge sheet<lb/> has been filed, FIR cannot be quashed. A charge sheet is the<lb/> culmination of the investigation by the police and is<lb/> accompanied by necessary documents, statement of witnesses<lb/> etc. Thus a petition praying for simplicitor quashing of FIR<lb/> becomes infructuous on filing of the charge sheet The only<lb/> resort with the accused in such a situation is either to<lb/> challenge the charge sheet as not making out any offence or<lb/> argue before the trial court at the stage of framing of charge.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>34. The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Kalyan<lb/> Singh &amp; Ors. SLP (CrL) No. 5632 of 2014 dated 4 th January, 2019 has<lb/> stated that:-<lb/></p>

			<item>CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> &quot;3.1. … the fact remains that the accused was facing the criminal<lb/> proceedings for the offences under Sections 307, 294 read with<lb/> Section 34 of the IPC and that the offences under these sections<lb/> are not non-compoundable offences and, looking to the serious<lb/> allegations against the accused we are of the opinion that the<lb/> High Court has committed a grave error in quashing the criminal<lb/> proceedings for the offences under Sections 307, 294 read with<lb/> Section 34 of the IPC solely on the ground that the original<lb/> Complainant and the accused have settled the dispute… In the<lb/> said decision, this Court has specifically observed and held that,<lb/> despite any settlement between the Complainant on the one hand<lb/> and the accused on the other, the criminal proceedings for the•<lb/> offences under Section 307 of the IPC cannot be quashed, as the<lb/> offence under Section 307 is a non compoundable offence.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>35. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, learned counsel for<lb/> the respondents submitted that instant petition is devoid of any merits and is<lb/> liable to be dismissed.<lb/></p>

			<head>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS<lb/></head>

			<p>36. Heard learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the<lb/> record.<lb/></p>

			<p>37. The inherent power of the High Court to quash a non-compoundable<lb/> offence is not circumscribed by any of the provisions of the Cr.P.C,<lb/> including Section 320. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C is a declaration of the<lb/> inherent power, pre-existing in the High Court and so long as the exercise<lb/> of the inherent power falls within the parameters of Section 482 of the<lb/> Cr.P.C., it shall have an overriding effect over any of the provisions of the<lb/> Cr.P.C. In exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.,<lb/> High Court may permit compounding of a non-compoundable offence,<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> provided that in doing so, it satisfies the conditions mentioned therein. It is<lb/> settled law that the power to quash the criminal proceedings under Section<lb/> 482 of the Cr.P.C exists even in non-compoundable offence but its actual<lb/> exercise will depend on the facts of a particular case. There are few tests<lb/> relevant to decide whether to quash or not to quash the criminal<lb/> proceedings i.e. (a) the nature and gravity of the case; (b) does the dispute<lb/> reflect overwhelming and predominantly civil nature; (c) would the<lb/> quashing involve settlement of entire or almost the entire dispute; (d) the<lb/> compromise/settlement between parties and/or other facts and the<lb/> circumstances render possibility of conviction remote and bleak; (e) not to<lb/> quash would cause extreme injustice and would not serve the ends of<lb/> justice; and (f) not to quash would result in abuse of process of court.<lb/></p>

			<p>38. If the powers under Section 482 are exercised, in relation to non-<lb/>compoundable offences, it will amount to what is prescribed by law and<lb/> such cases cannot be brought within the parameters &quot;to secure the ends of<lb/> justice&quot;. Any order in violation and breach of the statutory provisions,<lb/> would be a case against the ends of justice.<lb/></p>

			<p>39. In the case of CBI v. Keshub Mahindra, (2011) 6 SCC 216, the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;11. No decision by any court, this Court not excluded, can be<lb/> read in a manner as to nullify the express provisions of an Act<lb/> or the Code and the 1996 judgment never intended to do so. In<lb/> the 1996 judgment, this Court was at pains to make it<lb/> absolutely clear that its findings were based on materials<lb/> gathered in the investigation and brought before the Court till<lb/> that stage. At every place in the judgment where the Court<lb/> records the finding or makes an observation in regard to the<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> appropriate charge against the accused, it qualifies the finding<lb/> or the observation by saying &quot;on the materials produced by the<lb/> prosecution for framing charge&quot;. &quot;At this stage&quot;, is a kind of a<lb/> constant refrain in that judgment. The 1996 judgment was<lb/> rendered at the stage of Sections 209/228/240 of the Code and<lb/> we are completely unable to see how the judgment can be read<lb/> to say that it removed from the Code Sections 323, 216, 386,<lb/> 397, 399, 401, etc. or denuded a competent court of the powers<lb/> under those provisions. In our view, on the basis of the material<lb/> on record, it is wrong to assume that the 1996 judgment is a<lb/> fetter against the proper exercise of powers by a court of<lb/> competent jurisdiction under the relevant provisions of the<lb/> Code.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>40. In the case of State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy, (1977) 2 SCC<lb/> 699, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;7. The second limb of Mr Mookerjee&apos;s argument is that in<lb/> any event the High Court could not take upon itself the task of<lb/> assessing or appreciating the weight of material on the record<lb/> in order to find whether any charges could be legitimately<lb/> framed against the respondents. So long as there is some<lb/> material on the record to connect the accused with the crime,<lb/> says the learned counsel, the case must go on and the High<lb/> Court has no jurisdiction to put a precipitate or premature end<lb/> to the proceedings on the belief that the prosecution is not likely<lb/> to succeed. This, in our opinion, is too broad a proposition to<lb/> accept. Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 2 of<lb/> 1974, provides that:<lb/> If, upon consideration of the record of the case and<lb/> the documents submitted therewith, and after hearing<lb/> the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in<lb/> this behalf, the Judge considers that there is not<lb/> sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused,<lb/> he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons<lb/> for so doing.<lb/></item>

			<item>This section is contained in Chapter 18 called &quot;Trial Before a<lb/> Court of Session&quot;. It is clear from the provision that the<lb/> Sessions Court has the power to discharge an accused if after<lb/> perusing the record and hearing the parties he comes to the<lb/> conclusion, for reasons to be recorded, that there is not<lb/> sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The<lb/> object of the provision which requires the Sessions Judge to<lb/> record his reasons is to enable the superior court to examine<lb/> the correctness of the reasons for which the Sessions Judge has<lb/> held that there is or is not sufficient ground for proceeding<lb/> against the accused. The High Court therefore is entitled to go<lb/> into the reasons given by the Sessions Judge in support of his<lb/> order and to determine for itself whether the order is justified<lb/> by the facts and circumstances of the case. Section 482 of the<lb/> New Code, which corresponds to Section 561-A of the Code of<lb/> 1898, provides that:<lb/></item>

			<item>Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect<lb/> the inherent powers of the High Court to make such<lb/> orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order<lb/> under this Code or to prevent abuse of the process of<lb/> any Court or other wise to secure the ends of justice.<lb/></item>

			<item>In the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court is<lb/> entitled to quash a proceeding if it comes to the conclusion that<lb/> allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the<lb/> process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that the<lb/> proceeding ought to be quashed. The saving of the High Court&apos;s<lb/> inherent powers, both in civil and criminal matters, is designed<lb/> to achieve a salutary public purpose which is that a court<lb/> proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a<lb/> weapon of harassment or persecution. In a criminal case, the<lb/> veiled object behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the<lb/> material on which the structure of the prosecution rests and the<lb/> like would justify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> the interest of justice. The ends of justice are higher than the<lb/> ends of mere law though justice has got to be administered<lb/> according to laws made by the legislature. The compelling<lb/> necessity for making these observations is that without a proper<lb/> realisation of the object and purpose of the provision which<lb/> seeks to save the inherent powers of the High Court to do<lb/> justice, between the State and its subjects, it would be<lb/> impossible to appreciate the width and contours of that salient<lb/> jurisdiction.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>41. In the case of Ashok Sadarangani v. Union of India, (2012) 11 SCC<lb/> 321, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;24. Having carefully considered the facts and circumstances<lb/> of the case, as also the law relating to the continuance of<lb/> criminal cases where the complainant and the accused had<lb/> settled their differences and had arrived at an amicable<lb/> arrangement, we see no reason to differ with the views that had<lb/> been taken in Nikhil Merchant case [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008)<lb/> 3 SCC (Cri) 858] or Manoj Sharma case [(2008) 16 SCC 1 :<lb/> (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 145] or the several decisions that have<lb/> come thereafter. It is, however, no coincidence that the golden<lb/> thread which runs through all the decisions cited, indicates that<lb/> continuance of a criminal proceeding after a compromise has<lb/> been arrived at between the complainant and the accused,<lb/> would amount to abuse of the process of court and an exercise<lb/> in futility, since the trial could be prolonged and ultimately,<lb/> may conclude in a decision which may be of any consequence<lb/> to any of the other parties.<lb/></item>

			<item>25. Even in Sushil Suri case [(2011) 5 SCC 708 : (2011) 2<lb/> SCC (Cri) 764] on which the learned Additional Solicitor<lb/> General had relied, the learned Judges who decided the said<lb/> case, took note of the decisions in various other cases, where it<lb/> had been reiterated that the exercise of inherent powers would<lb/> depend entirely on the facts and circumstances of each case. In<lb/> other words, not that there is any restriction on the power or<lb/> authority vested in the Supreme Court in exercising powers<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> under Article 142 of the Constitution, but that in exercising<lb/> such powers the Court has to be circumspect, and has to<lb/> exercise such power sparingly in the facts of each case.<lb/></item>

			<item>26. Furthermore, the issue, which has been referred to a<lb/> larger Bench in Gian Singh case [(2010) 15 SCC 118] in<lb/> relation to the decisions of this Court in B.S. Joshi case [(2003)<lb/> 4 SCC 675 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 848] , Nikhil Merchant<lb/> case [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC (Cri) 858] , as<lb/> also Manoj Sharma case [(2008) 16 SCC 1 : (2010) 4 SCC<lb/> (Cri) 145] , deals with a situation which is different from that of<lb/> the present case. While in the cases referred to hereinabove, the<lb/> main question was whether the offences which were not<lb/> compoundable, under Section 320 CrPC could be quashed<lb/> under Section 482 CrPC, in Gian Singh case [(2010) 15 SCC<lb/> 118] the Court was of the view that a non-compoundable<lb/> offence could not be compounded and that the courts should not<lb/> try to take over the function of Parliament or the executive. In<lb/> fact, in none of the cases referred to in Gian Singh case [(2010)<lb/> 15 SCC 118] , did this Court permit compounding of non-<lb/>compoundable offences. On the other hand, upon taking<lb/> various factors into consideration, including the futility of<lb/> continuing with the criminal proceedings, this Court ultimately<lb/> quashed the same.<lb/></item>

			<item>27. In addition to the above, even with regard to CBI v. A.<lb/> Ravishankar Prasad [(2009) 6 SCC 351 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri)<lb/> 1063] this Court observed that the High Court can exercise<lb/> power under Section 482 CrPC to do real and substantial<lb/> justice and to prevent abuse of the process of court when<lb/> exceptional circumstances warranted the exercise of such<lb/> power. Once the circumstances in a given case were held to be<lb/> such as to attract the provisions of Article 142 or Articles 32<lb/> and 226 of the Constitution, it would be open to the Supreme<lb/> Court to exercise its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of<lb/> the Constitution to quash the proceedings, the continuance<lb/> whereof would only amount to abuse of the process of court.<lb/></item>

			<item>28. In the instant case the dispute between the petitioners<lb/> and the Banks having been compromised, we have to examine<lb/> whether the continuance of the criminal proceeding could turn<lb/> out to be an exercise in futility without anything positive being<lb/> ultimately achieved.<lb/></item>

			<item>29. As was indicated in Harbhajan Singh case [Harbhajan<lb/> Singh v. State of Punjab, (2009) 13 SCC 608 : (2010) 1 SCC<lb/> (Cri) 1135] , the pendency of a reference to a larger Bench,<lb/> does not mean that all other proceedings involving the same<lb/> issue would remain stayed till a decision was rendered in the<lb/> reference. The reference made in Gian Singh case [(2010) 15<lb/> SCC 118] need not, therefore, detain us. Till such time as the<lb/> decisions cited at the Bar are not modified or altered in any<lb/> way, they continue to hold the field.<lb/></item>

			<item>30. In the present case, the fact situation is different from<lb/> that in Nikhil Merchant case [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC<lb/> (Cri) 858] . While in Nikhil Merchant case [(2008) 9 SCC 677 :<lb/> (2008) 3 SCC (Cri) 858] the accused had misrepresented the<lb/> financial status of the company in question in order to avail of<lb/> credit facilities to an extent to which the Company was not<lb/> entitled, in the instant case, the allegation is that as part of a<lb/> larger conspiracy, property acquired on lease from a person<lb/> who had no title to the leased properties, was offered as<lb/> collateral security for loans obtained. Apart from the above, the<lb/> actual owner of the property has filed a criminal complaint<lb/> against Shri Kersi V. Mehta who had held himself out as the<lb/> attorney of the owner and his family members.<lb/></item>

			<item>31. The ratio of the decisions in B.S. Joshi case [(2003) 4<lb/> SCC 675 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 848] and in Nikhil Merchant<lb/> case [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC (Cri) 858] or for that<lb/> matter, even in Manoj Sharma case [(2008) 16 SCC 1 : (2010)<lb/> 4 SCC (Cri) 145] , does not help the case of the writ petitioners.<lb/> In Nikhil Merchant case [(2008) 9 SCC 677 : (2008) 3 SCC<lb/> (Cri) 858] , this Court had in the facts of the case observed that<lb/> the dispute involved had overtures of a civil dispute with<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> criminal facets. This is not so in the instant case where the<lb/> emphasis is more on the criminal intent of the petitioners than<lb/> on the civil aspect involving the dues of the Bank in respect of<lb/> which a compromise was worked out.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>42. In the case of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab, (2012) 10 SCC 303,<lb/> the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;52. The question is with regard to the inherent power of the<lb/> High Court in quashing the criminal proceedings against an<lb/> offender who has settled his dispute with the victim of the<lb/> crime but the crime in which he is allegedly involved is not<lb/> compoundable under Section 320 of the Code.<lb/></item>

			<item>53. Section 482 of the Code, as its very language suggests,<lb/> saves the inherent power of the High Court which it has by<lb/> virtue of it being a superior court to prevent abuse of the<lb/> process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.<lb/> It begins with the words, &quot;nothing in this Code&quot; which means<lb/> that the provision is an overriding provision. These words<lb/> leave no manner of doubt that none of the provisions of the<lb/> Code limits or restricts the inherent power. The guideline for<lb/> exercise of such power is provided in Section 482 itself i.e. to<lb/> prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to<lb/> secure the ends of justice. As has been repeatedly stated that<lb/> Section 482 confers no new powers on the High Court; it<lb/> merely safeguards existing inherent powers possessed by the<lb/> High Court necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any<lb/> court or to secure the ends of justice. It is equally well settled<lb/> that the power is not to be resorted to if there is specific<lb/> provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of an<lb/> aggrieved party. It should be exercised very sparingly and it<lb/> should not be exercised as against the express bar of law<lb/> engrafted in any other provision of the Code.<lb/></item>

			<item>54. In different situations, the inherent power may be<lb/> exercised in different ways to achieve its ultimate objective.<lb/> Formation of opinion by the High Court before it exercises<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> inherent power under Section 482 on either of the twin<lb/> objectives, (i) to prevent abuse of the process of any court, or<lb/> (ii) to secure the ends of justice, is a sine qua non.<lb/></item>

			<item>55. In the very nature of its constitution, it is the judicial<lb/> obligation of the High Court to undo a wrong in course of<lb/> administration of justice or to prevent continuation of<lb/> unnecessary judicial process. This is founded on the legal<lb/> maxim quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, conceditur et id sine<lb/> qua res ipsa esse non potest. The full import of which is<lb/> whenever anything is authorised, and especially if, as a matter<lb/> of duty, required to be done by law, it is found impossible to do<lb/> that thing unless something else not authorised in express<lb/> terms be also done, may also be done, then that something else<lb/> will be supplied by necessary intendment. Ex debito justitiae is<lb/> inbuilt in such exercise; the whole idea is to do real, complete<lb/> and substantial justice for which it exists. The power possessed<lb/> by the High Court under Section 482 of the Code is of wide<lb/> amplitude but requires exercise with great caution and<lb/> circumspection.<lb/></item>

			<item>56. It needs no emphasis that exercise of inherent power by<lb/> the High Court would entirely depend on the facts and<lb/> circumstances of each case. It is neither permissible nor<lb/> proper for the court to provide a straitjacket formula<lb/> regulating the exercise of inherent powers under Section 482.<lb/> No precise and inflexible guidelines can also be provided.<lb/></item>

			<item>***<lb/></item>

			<item>61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can<lb/> be summarised thus : the power of the High Court in quashing<lb/> a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its<lb/> inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power<lb/> given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under<lb/> Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude<lb/> with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord<lb/> with the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of<lb/> any court. In what cases power to quash the criminal<lb/> proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the<lb/> offender and the victim have settled their dispute would depend<lb/> on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category<lb/> can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power,<lb/> the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity<lb/> of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity<lb/> or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly<lb/> quashed even though the victim or victim&apos;s family and the<lb/> offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private<lb/> in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any<lb/> compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to<lb/> the offences under special statutes like the Prevention of<lb/> Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants<lb/> while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any<lb/> basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such<lb/> offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and<lb/> predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different footing for<lb/> the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising<lb/> from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or<lb/> such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony<lb/> relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong<lb/> is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have<lb/> resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the<lb/> High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view,<lb/> because of the compromise between the offender and the<lb/> victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and<lb/> continuation of the criminal case would put the accused to<lb/> great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be<lb/> caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full<lb/> and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In<lb/> other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be<lb/> unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the<lb/> criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal<lb/> proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law<lb/> despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the<lb/> wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is<lb/> appropriate that the criminal case is put to an end and if the<lb/> answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High<lb/> Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal<lb/> proceeding.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>43. In the present case, it is an admitted fact that at the time of filing of<lb/> the instant petition for quashing the FIR; the charge-sheet was not filed but<lb/> during the pendency of the instant petition; the Police have investigated the<lb/> entire matter and filed the charge-sheet against the accused persons before<lb/> the competent Court on 23 rd April, 2013 and that is not under challenge<lb/> before this Court. If the Police have filed the charge-sheet after completing<lb/> the investigation against the accused persons/petitioners and the competent<lb/> Court after perusing the materials collected by the Police, has taken the<lb/> cognizance and the same is not under challenge in the instant petition. In<lb/> such circumstances, the issue before this Court remains, whether the<lb/> impugned FIR can be quashed or not by this Court while exercising the<lb/> inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.<lb/></p>

			<p>44. While investigating the case, the Investigating Officer recorded the<lb/> statements of the witnesses, the statement of the complainant and collected<lb/> the all material evidence. After getting the evidences/materials against an<lb/> accused person, the investigating agency preferred to file a charge-sheet<lb/> against the said accused person before the competent Court. The<lb/> investigating officer investigated the matter and filed the chargesheet<lb/> against the accused person long back after collecting incriminating material<lb/> against the accused person, which is not under challenge before this Court.<lb/> In such circumstances, this Court cannot adjudicate or appreciate the<lb/> material which has been collected by the Investigating Agency during the<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> course of investigation for the purpose of quashing the chargesheet or the<lb/> FIR.<lb/></p>

			<p>45. The instant petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C was filed at the<lb/> stage of FIR, therefore, only the allegations in the FIR/complaint are<lb/> required to be considered and other grounds which have been vehemently<lb/> argued by the petitioners cannot be adjudicated by this Court in present<lb/> proceedings. The main argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners is<lb/> that the parties have entered into the compromise, therefore, the instant<lb/> petition is liable to be quashed on the basis of the said compromise.<lb/> However, the said compromise is disputed by the respondents herein and<lb/> vehemently opposed the instant petition.<lb/></p>

			<p>46. In view of the foregoing discussions, it is clear that the offences in<lb/> question are non-compoundable and the allegations have been investigated<lb/> by the investigating agency. The charge-sheet has thereafter been presented<lb/> and the learned Sessions Judge has taken cognizance of the same. As such,<lb/> the fact that the complainant had earlier entered into a compromise<lb/> agreement would not stand in the way of examining the allegations against<lb/> the accused at trial because the complainant has subsequently disavowed<lb/> the settlement agreement, alleging duress and coercion. These are<lb/> statutorily recognised as exceptions to a binding agreement under the Indian<lb/> Contract Act, 1872. Undoubtedly, the veracity of the complainant&quot;s<lb/> allegations of coercion and duress would also have to be tested in any other<lb/> appropriate proceedings. Be that as it may, once the complainant has<lb/> claimed that the settlement agreement is not valid in law, this Court cannot<lb/> prevent the prosecution from making its case against the accused at trial and<lb/> the judicial precedents to support this conclusion.<lb/></p>

			<p>47. In case of Ramgopal &amp; Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2021 SCC<lb/> OnLine SC 834, the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court has recently held as follows:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;19. We thus sum-up and hold that as opposed to Section 320<lb/> Cr.P.C. where the Court is squarely guided by the compromise<lb/> between the parties in respect of offences &apos;compoundable &apos;<lb/> within the statutory framework, the extra-ordinary power<lb/> enjoined upon a High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. or<lb/> vested in this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution, can<lb/> be invoked beyond the metes and bounds of Section 320 Cr.P.C.<lb/> Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude<lb/> ought to be exercised carefully in the context of<lb/> quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind: (i) Nature and<lb/> effect of the offence on the conscious of the<lb/> society; (ii) Seriousness of the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary<lb/> nature of compromise between the accused and the victim;<lb/> &amp; (iv) Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the<lb/> occurrence of the purported offence and/or other relevant<lb/> considerations.<lb/></item>

			<item>20. Having appraised the afore-stated para-meters and<lb/> weighing upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of the two<lb/> appeals before us, we are inclined to invoke powers under<lb/> Article 142 and quash the criminal proceedings and<lb/> consequently set aside the conviction in both the appeals. We<lb/> say so for the reasons that:<lb/> Firstly, the occurrence(s) involved in these appeals<lb/> can be categorized as purely personal or having<lb/> overtones of criminal proceedings of private nature;<lb/></item>

			<item>Secondly, the nature of injuries incurred, for which<lb/> the Appellants have been convicted, do not appear to<lb/> exhibit their mental depravity or commission of an<lb/> CRL.M.C. 1396/2011<lb/> offence of such a serious nature that quashing of<lb/> which would override public interest;<lb/> Thirdly, given the nature of the offence and injuries, it<lb/> is immaterial that the trial against the Appellants had<lb/> been concluded or their appeal(s) against conviction<lb/> stand dismissed;<lb/> Fourthly, the parties on their own volition, without<lb/> any coercion or compulsion, willingly and voluntarily<lb/> have buried their differences and wish to accord a<lb/> quietus to their dispute(s);<lb/> Fifthly, the occurrence(s) in both the cases took place<lb/> way back in the years 2000 and 1995, respectively.<lb/> There is nothing on record to evince that either before<lb/> or after the purported compromise, any untoward<lb/> incident transpired between the parties;<lb/> Sixthly, since the Appellants and the complainant(s)<lb/> are residents of the same village(s) and/or work in<lb/> close vicinity, the quashing of criminal proceedings<lb/> will advance peace, harmony, and fellowship amongst<lb/> the parties who have decided to forget and forgive<lb/> any ill-will and have no vengeance against each<lb/> other; and<lb/> Seventhly, the cause of administration of criminal<lb/> justice system would remain un-effected on<lb/> acceptance of the amicable settlement between the<lb/> parties and/or resultant acquittal of the Appellants;<lb/> more so looking at their present age.&quot;<lb/> (emphasis supplied)<lb/></item>

			<p>48. Similarly, in case of State of M.P. v. Laxmi Narayan, (2019) 5 SCC<lb/> 688, the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court had held as follows:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;15. Considering the law on the point and the other decisions of<lb/> this Court on the point, referred to hereinabove, it is observed and<lb/> held as under:<lb/></item>

			<item>15.1. That the power conferred under Section 482 of the<lb/> Code to quash the criminal proceedings for the non-<lb/>compoundable offences under Section 320 of the Code<lb/> can be exercised having overwhelmingly and<lb/> predominantly the civil character, particularly those<lb/> arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of<lb/> matrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the<lb/> parties have resolved the entire dispute amongst<lb/> themselves;<lb/></item>

			<item>***<lb/></item>

			<item>15.5 While exercising the power under Section 482 of the<lb/> Code to quash the criminal proceedings in respect of<lb/> non-compoundable offences, which are private in nature<lb/> and do not have a serious impact on society, on the<lb/> ground that there is a settlement/compromise between the<lb/> victim and the offender, the High Court is required to<lb/> consider the antecedents of the accused; the conduct of<lb/> the accused, namely, whether the accused was<lb/> absconding and why he was absconding, how he had<lb/> managed with the complainant to enter into a<lb/> compromise, etc.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>49. It is therefore clear that, this Court should exercise its extra-ordinary<lb/> powers under section 482 of the Cr.P.C only when it is satisfied that the<lb/> settlement agreement or the compromise between the victim and the<lb/> offender has been freely and voluntarily executed or reached. In the present<lb/> facts and circumstances, that is not so because the complainant has assailed<lb/> the very legality of that agreement or compromise.<lb/> CONCLUSION<lb/></p>

			<p>50. Perusal of several judgments on quashing of FIR, shows that<lb/> constitutional courts ordinarily exercise powers under section 482 of the<lb/> Cr.P.C after considering the fact that there is no objection by the victim to<lb/> such exercise of power. Moreover, it is not as if the allegations made by the<lb/> complainant are purely in nature, having been investigated into and<lb/> taken cognizance by the learned Sessions Judge. In the peculiar facts and<lb/> circumstance of instant case, it would be perilous for this Court to rely upon<lb/> the agreement or compromise to justify quashing the FIR in question,<lb/> particularly when the complainant is contesting the merits of the instant<lb/> petition under section 482 of the Cr.P.C.<lb/></p>

			<p>51. In view of the above facts and circumstances and foregoing<lb/> discussions, this Court does not find any merit in the instant petition for<lb/> exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction for the purpose of quashing the<lb/> instant FIR as prayed for.<lb/></p>

			<p>52. Accordingly, the instant petition is dismissed along with pending<lb/> applications, if any.<lb/></p>

			<p>53. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.<lb/></p>
