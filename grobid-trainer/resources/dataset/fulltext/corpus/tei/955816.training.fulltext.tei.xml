			<p>1.<lb/> By way of the present writ petition, the petitioner has prayed<lb/> thus:-<lb/>&quot;A. By an appropriate writ, order or direction, the<lb/> respondents may kindly be directed to return the<lb/> original title deeds in respect of the properties<lb/> belonging to the petitioner which were given as<lb/> security by way of deposit of title deeds in respect of<lb/> the transaction covered by sanctioning letter dated<lb/> 18.04.2015.<lb/> B. By an appropriate writ, order or direction, the<lb/> respondent may further be directed to return the<lb/> original title deeds of the properties stated below:-<lb/>a. Commercial office No.514, 515 &amp; 516<lb/> admeasuring approx. 570 Sq. ft. situated at 3 rd<lb/> floor, SM Lodha Complex, Plot No.109-C. Shastri<lb/> Circle Post Office, Near Court Chauraha, Udaipur,<lb/> Rajasthan;<lb/> b. Commercial office No.513 admeasuring 165<lb/> Sq. ft. situated at 3 rd floor, SM Lodha Complex,<lb/> Plot No.109-C. Shastri Circle Post Office, Near<lb/> Court Chauraha, Udaipur, Rajasthan;<lb/> c. Commercial office No.512 admeasuring 305<lb/> Sq. ft. situated at 3 rd floor, SM Lodha Complex,<lb/> Plot No.109-C. Shastri Circle Post Office, Near<lb/> Court Chauraha, Udaipur, Rajasthan.<lb/> C. By an appropriate writ, order or direction the<lb/> response of the respondent bank Dt. 28.10.2021<lb/> whereby they have denied releasing the mortgaged<lb/> property, may kindly be castigated and appropriate<lb/> directions be issued to act in fair and lawful manner.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> Undisputed facts, which emanate from the record are that<lb/> the borrower M/s. Marudhar Metals and Minerals availed a credit<lb/> facility from the respondent -Bank of Baroda, in which the<lb/> present petitioner (Ashok Kumar Mehta) stood guarantor and<lb/> created security interest of his four properties.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> The borrower, however failed to honor its commitment, due<lb/> to which the respondent-Bank initiated proceedings under the<lb/> Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and<lb/> Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002<lb/> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act of 2002&quot;) and a notice under<lb/> section 13(2) of the Act was issued, whereafter the possession of<lb/> the secured assets were taken and after issuance of notice of<lb/> possession under section 13(4) of the Act of 2002, a notification<lb/> for e-auction notice was issued. Accordingly, e-auction was held<lb/> on 07.06.2019.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> In the e-auction aforesaid, all the four properties of the<lb/> guarantor were offered for sale. Scanned copy of the e-auction<lb/> notice is placed hereinfra:-<lb/>successful bidder and sale letter/communication for the same was<lb/> issued.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> In the meantime, the petitioner, guarantor for the loan<lb/> managed to deposit the entire outstanding amount with the<lb/> respondent-Bank. Out of which, a part payment was made prior<lb/> to the auction and remaining amount was paid after the auction<lb/> proceedings were held, however, before the sale letter got<lb/> registered.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> The petitioner has challenged the confirmation of sale of the<lb/> 1 st property made in favour of the successful bidder before the<lb/> Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the<lb/> Appellate Tribunal&quot;) and the matter is still pending consideration.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> The lis pending before the Appellate Tribunal is mainly for<lb/> consideration on the issue -&quot;as to whether the authorized officer<lb/> was justified in confirming the sale in favour of successful bidder&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> The petitioner made a representation before the respondent-<lb/>Bank to release the original documents of his other three<lb/> properties, which are not subject matter of any dispute, as the<lb/> entire loan amount has been paid by the petitioner and there is no<lb/> dispute so far as the remaining three properties (property No.2, 3<lb/> and 4) are concerned.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. The respondent-Bank turned down petitioner&apos;s request,<lb/> inter-alia, observing that the matter is pending before the<lb/> Appellate Tribunal and according to the terms and condition of the<lb/> loan, petitioner&apos;s remaining properties cannot be released.<lb/></p>

			<p>11. Mr. Abhishek Pareek, learned counsel for the petitioner<lb/> argued that indisputably, the entire outstanding amount of the<lb/> respondent-Bank in relation to the credit facility availed by the<lb/> borrower has been paid and rather the petitioner has deposited an<lb/> excess amount of more than Rs. 10 lacs.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. Learned counsel further argued that even if the petitioner&apos;s<lb/> appeal, pending before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, is<lb/> rejected or allowed, the sale would be either finalised in favour of<lb/> the auction purchaser or set aside. In either of the eventualities<lb/> respondent-Bank would not be requiring any further amount.<lb/> Hence, the respondent-Bank&apos;s action of not releasing documents<lb/> qua property No.2, 3 &amp; 4 is arbitrary.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. Mr. Dhanesh Saraswat, learned counsel appearing for the<lb/> respondent-Bank, on the other hand, submitted that as per the<lb/> loan agreement, unless the entire loan is cleared and &apos;No<lb/> Objection Certificate (NOC)&apos; is issued in this regard, neither the<lb/> security interest created against the assets of the borrower or the<lb/> guarantor can be eschewed, nor can the documents be released.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. Learned counsel for the respondent-Bank argued that the<lb/> petitioner should pursue his appeal before the Appellate Authority<lb/> and get the matter finally adjudicated. Whereafter, the Bank<lb/> would naturally release the original documents in accordance with<lb/> law.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. It was also argued that in the representation/letter sent by<lb/> the petitioner, no extraordinary circumstances were pointed out<lb/> by the petitioner, under which the Bank should accede to his<lb/> request of releasing the documents.<lb/></p>

			<p>16. An objection was also raised by learned counsel for the<lb/> respondent-Bank that the petitioner -a guarantor has approached<lb/> this Court, without impleading the borrower as party. Hence, the<lb/> writ petition is not competent.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. Mr. Saraswat nevertheless submitted that as per the<lb/> instructions available to him, no excess amount has been<lb/> deposited by the petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the<lb/> material available on record.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. It is undisputed fact that the entire loan amount or the<lb/> amount advanced to the borrower M/s. Marudhar Metals and<lb/> Minerals stands paid by the borrower/guarantor.<lb/></p>

			<p>20. The dispute, which is pending consideration before the<lb/> Appellate Tribunal is that, as to whether auction sale of property<lb/> No.1 made in favour of the successful bidder was valid or not.<lb/></p>

			<p>21. In the opinion of this Court, in any eventuality, if the<lb/> petitioner&apos;s appeal succeeds or fails, the respondent-Bank is<lb/> having the original documents of title qua property No.1 and,<lb/> therefore, the contingency arising out of petitioner&apos;s appeal being<lb/> dismissed would be taken care of by the excess amount paid by<lb/> the petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>22. Concededly, there is no quarrel in relation to remaining three<lb/> properties. The respondent-Bank&apos;s stand that unless the entire<lb/> dispute is resolved and NOC is issued in this regard, by the<lb/> respondent-Bank, it cannot handover the documents to the<lb/> petitioner, cannot be countenanced.<lb/></p>

			<p>23. This Court does not find any substance in the respondent-<lb/>Bank&apos;s stance that the petitioner has not stated any specific<lb/> circumstance for which, the documents in question should be<lb/> released.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. According to this Court, stand of the respondent-Bank per-se<lb/> is contradictory.<lb/></p>

			<p>25. If the stand of the respondent-Bank is, that it cannot release<lb/> the documents unless NOC is granted then, it is inconsequential<lb/> whether reasons have been assigned or not by the petitioner. In<lb/> case their such stand does not find favour, then, they cannot sit<lb/> over the documents simply because the petitioner has failed to<lb/> give good reasons, why he requires the documents.<lb/></p>

			<p>26. In the opinion of this Court, the petitioner is not required to<lb/> satisfy the respondent-Bank, as to why he is in requirement of the<lb/> document of other three properties.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. The mere fact that the entire loan amount has been paid is<lb/> reason enough for a borrower/guarantor to ask for the documents.<lb/></p>

			<p>28. In order to meet with the contingency, in case petitioner&apos;s<lb/> appeal before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal fails (though<lb/> according to the petitioner excess amount is lying with the<lb/> respondent Bank) the petitioner may be called upon to file an<lb/> undertaking to pay the remaining amount (if any).<lb/></p>

			<p>29. The writ petition is allowed.<lb/></p>

			<p>30. The petitioner shall be required to file an undertaking before<lb/> the respondent-Bank that in case any further liability arises on<lb/> account of the dispute being pending before the Appellate<lb/> Tribunal, he shall pay the same to the respondent-Bank in<lb/> accordance with law, however, subject to his right of raising just<lb/> objection and challenging the same.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. The respondent-Bank is directed to handover the original<lb/> documents to the petitioner of property No.2, 3 and 4 (excluding<lb/> the property No.1) within a period of one week of furnishing duly<lb/> notarised undertaking alongwith affidavit of petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>32. In case, the petitioner fails to honor his undertaking, the<lb/> respondent-Bank shall be free to take up appropriate proceedings,<lb/> including filing of contempt petition.<lb/></p>

			<p>33. The writ petition as well as stay application stands disposed<lb/> of.<lb/></p>
