			<p>For Plaintiffs<lb/> : Ms.Gladys Daniel<lb/> For Defendant<lb/> : Set exparte<lb/> JUDGMENT<lb/> There are three plaintiffs. Plaintiff No.1 is an individual i.e., a natural<lb/> person. Plaintiff Nos.2 and 3 are Private Limited Companies i.e., juristic<lb/> persons. Ms.Gladys Daniel, counsel on record for all the three plaintiffs is<lb/> before this Commercial Division.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. The sole defendant was duly served with suit summons, but did not<lb/> appear or enter appearance through a counsel. The sole defendant was set<lb/> ex-parte and the suit itself was set down for recording ex-parte evidence<lb/> before the learned Additional Master III. One Mr.B.Gnana Sambandam deposed<lb/> as P.W.1, on behalf of all the three plaintiffs and 24 exhibits i.e., Exs.P1 to<lb/> P24 were marked through him.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. Today, this suit is listed for arguments before this Commercial<lb/> Division.<lb/></p>

			<p>4. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to set out the case of the<lb/> plaintiffs in a nutshell. Main thrust of plaintiffs&apos; complaint is that the<lb/> defendant is infringing and passing off qua four of their registered trademarks.<lb/> The four trademarks are Trade Mark Nos.838786, 1116254, 1479159 and<lb/> 1715718. These four trademarks have been marked as Exs.P18 to P21. These<lb/> four trademarks are hereinafter referred to as &apos;suit TMs&apos; for the sake of brevity,<lb/> convenience and clarity. The details of the suit TMs can be tabulated and set<lb/> out as follows:<lb/></p>

			<item>S.No. Trademark No.<lb/> Class and goods<lb/> Mark<lb/></item>

			<item>1<lb/> 838786<lb/> 30-Masala Powder and Spices<lb/> AACHI<lb/></item>

			<item>2<lb/> 1116254<lb/> 30-All kinds of Food preparations for<lb/> human consumption coffee, Tea,<lb/> Coca, Sugar, Rice, Tapioca, Sago,<lb/> Coffee<lb/> Substitutes,<lb/> Flour<lb/> and<lb/> Preparations made from cereals,<lb/> Bread, Biscuits, Cakes, Pastry and<lb/> Confectionery, Ice<lb/> 3<lb/> 1479159<lb/> 30-All kinds of Masala Powders and<lb/> Spices, Honey, Crystallized Fruits,<lb/> Dates, Fruit Jellies, Jams, processed<lb/> peanut, pickle, potato chips and potato<lb/> crisps, all kinds of flour, coffee, Tea<lb/> cocoa, sugar, rice, tapioca and<lb/> artificial powder, asafetida, turmeric<lb/> powder, idly chilly powder appalams,<lb/> orid dhall, Toor dhall, Moong Dhall<lb/> and all kinds of Dhall, included in<lb/> class 30<lb/> 4<lb/> 1715718<lb/> 43-Services for chain of restaurants,<lb/> Providing of Food and Drink,<lb/> Temporary Accommodation, canteen,<lb/> catering, self service restaurants, fast<lb/> food restaurants and snack bars<lb/> AACHI<lb/> KITCHN<lb/></item>

			<p>5. It is the case of the plaintiffs that somewhere in October 2017, they<lb/> came to know about the alleged infringement of their suit TMs and passing off<lb/> by the defendant.<lb/> The instant suit vide plaint dated 30.10.2017 was<lb/> presented/filed in this Court on 15.11.2017. Thereafter, this suit took the<lb/> trajectory, which has been set out supra.<lb/></p>

			<p>6. Today in the hearing, learned counsel for plaintiffs Ms.Gladys Daniel<lb/> brings to my notice that the depiction of the suit TMs by the plaintiffs has been<lb/> marked by way of a photograph being Ex.P22 and the same is as follows:<lb/> To be noted, one photograph is that of the Restaurant and the other is Menu<lb/> card. These two together constitute Ex.P.22. (Ideally it should have been<lb/> marked as Ex.P22 series)<lb/></p>

			<p>7. To buttress the case of infringement and passing off, my attention is<lb/> drawn to the alleged offending mark that has been used by the defendant, has<lb/> been marked as Ex.P 24. Ex.P 24 is as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>8. To be noted, in the suit TMs, the word AACHI is a very prominent part<lb/> of the mark.<lb/></p>

			<p>9. Plaintiffs have set out the manner in which the suit TMs evolved. This<lb/> is articulated in paragraph Nos.8 to 10 of the plaint, which read as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;8. A proprietary concern Aachi Spices and Foods was<lb/> registered on 28.12.2006. Aachi Masala Foods P Ltd., who<lb/> acquired the trademark AACHI on 30.11.2016 from Abishek<lb/> Enterprises and Naveen Products assigned the same in favour of<lb/> the 1 st plaintiff, trading as Aachi Spices And Foods on<lb/> 30.03.2007. On 01.04.2007, the 1 st plaintiff, trading as Aachi<lb/> Spices and Foods executed a License User Agreement in favour of<lb/> Aachi Masala Foods P Ltd. The sole proprietary concern of the 1 st<lb/> plaintiff owned the Intellectual Property Rights under the<lb/> trademark AACHI. The Trademark AACHI expanded on its list of<lb/> products. The business of AACHI was expanding in mammoth<lb/> proportions. On 17.03.2010, Aachi Spices and Foods Private<lb/> Limited were incorporated. At the time of incorporation of<lb/> Aachi Spices and Foods Private Limited the Memorandum of<lb/> Association of the company reiterated at Clause B-11 that the<lb/> Trademark AACHI along with its right, title and interest were<lb/> vested with the 1 st plaintiff who already owned the Trademark<lb/> AACHI. On 21.04.2010 the 1 st plaintiff entered into a Licence<lb/> User Agreement with Aachi Spices and Foods Private Limited to<lb/> use the trademark AACHI. On 21.04.2010 the 1 st plaintiff<lb/> entered into a fresh License User Agreement with AACHI Masala<lb/> Foods Private Limited.<lb/></p>

			<p>9. The 1 st plaintiff is the proprietor of the trademark<lb/> AACHI. He continues to use the trademark AACHI through his<lb/> Licensees AACHI Spices and Foods Private Limited and the 2 nd<lb/> Plaintiff. The 3 rd Plaintiff is the licensee of the 1 st Plaintiff&apos;s<lb/> registered Trade Marks AACHI KITCHEN and AACHI CHETTINAD<lb/> RESTAURANT.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. The Plaintiffs have also diversified their business<lb/> activities and started manufacturing and marketing various kinds<lb/> of consumer goods, within a short span of 17 years. The<lb/> Plaintiffs have now become one of the leading manufacturers of<lb/> packaged masalas. Because of the efforts undertaken by the<lb/> Plaintiffs in promoting and advertising their products through<lb/> various mediums, their market share in these products have<lb/> risen considerably. The Plaintiffs have put in enormous effort,<lb/> hard work and money towards advertising their products AACHI<lb/> in all forms of media such as radio, newspapers, hoardings,<lb/> magazines and television networks. The Plaintiffs have also<lb/> received many prestigious awards for the quality of products and<lb/> customer service.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>10. Plaintiffs have also mentioned about the manner in which they have<lb/> used and promoted the mark, which are contained in paragraph Nos.13 and 14<lb/> of the plaint, which read as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;13. The subject matter of this proceeding is in respect<lb/> of &apos;AACHI&apos; word mark. This word mark as whole has been used<lb/> by the Plaintiffs since 1995 and has become a well known Trade<lb/> Mark of the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs have honestly adopted the<lb/> mark and have put in enormous amount of hard work and labour<lb/> and invested huge sums of money, for advertisement and sales<lb/> promotional expenses. Because of the efforts made by the<lb/> Plaintiffs, the trade and the public, associate the mark with the<lb/> Plaintiffs and none else. The Trade Mark of the Plaintiffs as<lb/> used is registered.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. The plaintiffs have been using this mark AACHI with<lb/> respect to almost all the masala preparations from the<lb/> commencement of its business. As a result of the efforts<lb/> undertaken by the Plaintiffs its turnover has been increasing,<lb/> substantially every year.<lb/> The turnover and promotional<lb/> expenditure incurred by M/s.Abishek Enterprises, M/s.Naveen<lb/> Products, M/s.Nazareth Foods Pvt. Ltd. and M/s.Aachi Masala<lb/> Foods Pvt. Ltd., since 1995 is given hereunder:<lb/></p>

			<p>S.No.<lb/> Year<lb/> Turnover<lb/> (in Rs)<lb/> Advertising<lb/> Expenditure<lb/> (in Rs)<lb/> 1<lb/> 1995-1996<lb/> 3,96,420.00<lb/> 9.983.00<lb/> 2<lb/> 1996-1997<lb/> 4,37,568.00<lb/> 4,691.00<lb/> 3<lb/> 1997-1998<lb/> 5,10,755.00<lb/> 352.00<lb/> 4<lb/> 1998-1999<lb/> 14,68,159.00<lb/> 15,820.00<lb/> 5<lb/> 1999-2000<lb/> 20,27,457.00<lb/> 16,775.00<lb/> 6<lb/> 2000-2001<lb/> 52,03,979.00<lb/> 57,676.00<lb/> 7<lb/> 2001-2002<lb/> 64,12,491.00<lb/> 2,13,512.00<lb/> 8<lb/> 2002-2003<lb/> 1,69,44,334.00<lb/> 6,62,290.00<lb/> 9<lb/> 2003-2004<lb/> 9,00,05,884.00<lb/> 19,63,479.00<lb/> 10<lb/> 2004-2005<lb/> 24,46,95,540.00<lb/> 1,13,28,450.00<lb/> 11<lb/> 2005-2006<lb/> 79,47,99,230.00<lb/> 4,63,96,880.00<lb/> 12<lb/> 2006-2007<lb/> 1,36,54,50,781.00<lb/> 5,68,45,817.00<lb/> 13<lb/> 2007-2008<lb/> 2,07,85,55,508.00<lb/> 7,87,06,261.00<lb/> 14<lb/> 2008-2009<lb/> 4,14,12,42,106.00<lb/> 9,40,86,979.00<lb/> 15<lb/> 2009-2010<lb/> 4,73,98,26,852.00<lb/> 10,76,86,530.00<lb/> 16<lb/> 2010-2011<lb/> 6,40,40,50,524.00<lb/> 11,63,97,497.00<lb/> 17<lb/> 2011-2012<lb/> 7,59,35,14,309.00<lb/> 12,42,15,050.00<lb/> 18<lb/> 2012-2013<lb/> 8,82,91,64,390.00<lb/> 13,72,06,476.00<lb/> 19<lb/> 2013-2014<lb/> 11,27,06,92,876.00<lb/> 19,57,87,446.00<lb/> 20<lb/> 2014-2015<lb/> 13,20,61,70,537.00<lb/> 21,00,17,044.00<lb/></p>

			<p>11. From the aforesaid details, it comes to light that the plaintiffs have<lb/> been expending/shelling out, substantial sums of money towards<lb/> advertisement expenditure.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. Be that as it may, learned counsel for plaintiffs brings to my notice<lb/> that plaintiffs have been very diligently protecting their suit TMs as well as the<lb/> other trademark registrations in their favour. It is highlighted that they have<lb/> been so diligent that the plaintiffs have taken immediate action against a<lb/> person in California in the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in United States<lb/> of America. The order dated 13.09.2016 has been marked as Ex.P23. This is<lb/> being referred to, to emphasise that the plaintiffs have been very diligent in<lb/> protecting their mark and particularly suit TMs.<lb/> With regard to the<lb/> relationship between the three plaintiffs, it is to be mentioned that the first<lb/> plaintiff, who is a natural person is the owner of the suit TMs. The second<lb/> plaintiff, which is a juristic person and a company is a general licensee under<lb/> the first plaintiff vide License User Agreement, which has been marked as<lb/> Ex.P13. With regard to plaintiff No.3, which is also a juristic person, I am<lb/> informed that plaintiff No.3 is a license with regard to one specific service i.e.,<lb/> Restaurant services and this License User Agreement between the first plaintiff<lb/> and the third plaintiff has been marked as Ex.P15.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant has not chosen to enter<lb/> appearance and resist the suit, owing to which the defendant has been set ex-<lb/>parte in this suit, I have perused the pleadings, deposition and<lb/> exhibits/documents that have been placed before me. I find that the<lb/> deposition of P.W.1 is in tune/ tandem with the pleadings in the plaint. In<lb/> other words, the deposition of P.W.1 supports the pleadings in the plaint.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. I have also compared the two marks i.e., Exs.P18 to P21 on one side<lb/> and Exs.P22 and P24 on the other side.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. I find that the plaintiffs have made out a clear case for infringement<lb/> and passing off. Therefore, the plaintiffs will certainly be entitled to the<lb/> reliefs of injunctions against infringement and passing off, which are sub-<lb/>paragraphs (a) and (b) of pliant paragraph No.38. The other sub-paragraphs<lb/> are (c) to (f). While sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) are usual prayers for surrender<lb/> of offending mark and accounts, sub-paragraph (e) is for costs of the suit. To<lb/> be noted, sub-paragraph (f) is a residuary prayer.<lb/></p>

			<p>16. In the light of the conclusion that the plaintiffs are entitled to<lb/> injunctive reliefs qua infringement of suit TMs and passing off, it follows as a<lb/> sequitur that the plaintiffs are entitled to surrender of offending materials as<lb/> well as accounts as sought for in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of the plaint prayer<lb/> paragraph.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. With regard to the costs prayer, on coming to know of the offending<lb/> use by the defendant in October 2017, plaintiffs have diligently filed the plaint<lb/> dated 30.10.2017 on 15.11.2017 and carried it to its logical end by pursuing the<lb/> matter diligently. Therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. With regard to the residuary prayer, as there is a prayer for<lb/> accounts, I make it clear that if the plaintiffs are able to get accounts, which<lb/> is being decreed or quantify the damages in manner, it is open to the plaintiffs<lb/> to seek damages, if they choose to do so and if so advised.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. In the light of the narrative supra, it follows that this suit deserves<lb/> to be decreed with costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>20. Suit is decreed with costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>14.03.2018<lb/> Speaking/Non-Speaking order<lb/> Index : Yes/No<lb/> vsm<lb/> M.SUNDAR, J.<lb/> vsm<lb/> C.S.No.911 of 2017<lb/> 14.03.2018</p>
