        </p>

        <p>
            8.
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs plead that their SUN (Device)/logo consisting of four
            <lb />
            spheres interlocked/

            <lb />
            the said artistic work under Section 13(1) of the Copyright Act. Plaintiff

            No.1 is the first owner of Copyright in the SUN (Device) having exclusive
            <lb />
            right to use the same under Section 14 of the Copyright Act.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            9.
            <lb />
            It is further averred that the mark ISITE/I-SITE was coined by
            <lb />
            Plaintiff No.1&apos;s predecessor in the year 1997 and has been in use ever since.
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs&apos; product under the said mark is a well-balanced combination of
            <lb />
            vital vitamins and minerals in appropriate concentrations, which have been
            <lb />
            formulated to help in formation of blood cells, improving vision, treating
            <lb />
            acne, regulating blood pressure and treating certain skin disorders.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            10. In order to obtain statutory protection, Plaintiff No.1&apos;s predecessor
            <lb />
            obtained registrations of the ISITE trademark in Class 5 for different goods
            <lb />
            such as medicinal, pharmaceutical and veterinary preparations and
            <lb />
            substances, dental preparations, dietary preparations, health and food
            <lb />
            supplements for medical use in India, as mentioned in para 11 of the plaint
            <lb />
            and the same are valid and subsisting. Plaintiff No.2 is stated to be recorded
            <lb />
            as the subsequent proprietor qua the aforementioned trademarks. Apart from
            <lb />
            the said ISITE mark, Plaintiffs are also commercially using the trademark
            <lb />
            NEW I-SITE and I-SITE PLUS.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            11. It is averred that the trademark
            <lb />
            and ISITE/I-SITE and
            <lb />
            I-SITE formative trademarks have acquired distinctiveness and enviable
            <lb />
            goodwill and reputation due to their extensive, long and continuous use
            <lb />
            since the years 1993 and 1997 respectively. The goods bearing the said
            <lb />
            trademarks identify Plaintiffs as a source or origin. Plaintiffs have statutory
            <lb />
            as well as common law rights to the exclusive use of the trademarks and the
            <lb />
            formative trademarks and, therefore, use of the same or deceptively similar
            <lb />
            trademarks by an unauthorised person, in relation to similar goods, amounts
            <lb />
            to infringement of the Plaintiffs&apos; rights under Section 29 of the Trade Marks
            <lb />
            Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the &apos;Trade Marks Act&apos;). Plaintiffs
            <lb />
            further claim that the said trademarks have acquired the status of
            <lb />
            well-known trademarks under Section 2(1)(zb) of the Trade Marks Act,
            <lb />
            which entitles them to the highest degree of statutory protection against any
            <lb />
            form of misappropriation and dilution of distinctiveness, irrespective of the
            <lb />
            nature of goods or business that they are used for.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            12. It is further stated that health supplements sold under the marks
            <lb />
            I-SITE, NEW I-SITE and I-SITE PLUS, are Over-the-Counter (OTC)
            <lb />
            products. Once a product is marketed as an OTC product, it is promoted
            <lb />
            extensively in a manner so as to gain consumer awareness. OTC products
            <lb />
            can be purchased over the counter without prescription of medical
            <lb />
            practitioners and are primarily purchased by consumers who make informed
            <lb />
            decisions on their own. In such a case, the burden falls heavily on the brand
            <lb />
            owner to reach out to consumers on its own, by marketing and promotion.
            <lb />
            Quality consistency and control, goodwill and distinctiveness of the brand
            <lb />
            for identification of source and origin of the product become significant
            <lb />
            factors and thus, the trademark acquires greater significance as a source
            <lb />
            identifier and constitutes valuable trademark rights for the proprietor. Hence,
            <lb />
            OTC products form a class different from prescription or scheduled drugs
            <lb />
            and ought to be treated differently for purpose of likelihood of consumer
            <lb />
            confusion.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            13. Plaintiffs have, in the plaint, set out sales figures commencing from
            <lb />
            the years 1992-93 to 2020-21 as well as statement of sales and promotion for
            <lb />
            the period between 2012-13 to 2018-19 with respect to the goods sold under
            <lb />
            the logo. Sales figures for the goods sold under the mark ISITE and its
            <lb />
            formative marks have also been furnished in para 17 of the plaint.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            14. It is averred that Plaintiffs have been vigilant and zealous in
            <lb />
            protecting their intellectual property rights and have been taking actions
            <lb />
            from time to time against third parties from using deceptively similar marks.
            <lb />
            A list mentioning some of the Court orders as brought forth in para 18 of the
            <lb />
            plaint is as under:

            17. It is averred that from the packaging of the product, it was discovered
            <lb />
            that the aforesaid products are being marketed by both the Defendants. Upon
            <lb />
            conducting a search on the official website of the Trade Marks Registry, it
            <lb />
            was further discovered that Defendant No.1 has filed trademark applications
            <lb />
            for registration of the impugned mark EYESITE. Application No. 4006600
            <lb />
            dated 24.11.2018 for registration of trademark EYESITE (word) was filed
            <lb />
            on &apos;Proposed to be Used&apos; basis for goods namely &apos;medicinal and
            <lb />
            pharmaceutical preparation included in class 5&apos;, stating that the impugned
            <lb />
            mark was being used since 11.02.2019 and invoices dated 13.02.2019 and
            <lb />
            05.08.2019 were placed on record. Pertinently, registration was rejected by
            <lb />
            the Registrar of Trade Marks vide order dated 13.03.2020 on the ground that
            <lb />
            the mark is objectionable under Sections 9(1)(a) and 9(1)(b) of the Trade
            <lb />
            Marks Act. The order has not been challenged and thus, has attained finality.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            18. It is further pleaded that application No.4931158 dated 02.04.2021 for
            <lb />
            registration of the trademark
            <lb />
            /EYESITE (Label)
            <lb />
            was filed on &apos;Proposed to be Used&apos; basis in class 5 for goods, namely
            <lb />
            &apos;pharmaceutical and medicine preparations&apos; and is pending before the Trade
            <lb />
            Marks Registry, as objection has been raised under Section 9(1)(b) of the
            <lb />
            Trade Marks Act. It is averred that Defendant No.1 does not hold
            <lb />
            registration per se for the mark
            <lb />
            , however, there is a registration
            <lb />
            under No.4030881 for the trademark
            <lb />
            /Kinetic
            <lb />
            Lifescience (Label) dated 18.12.2018, on an application filed on &apos;Proposed
            <lb />
            to be Used&apos; basis.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            19. According to the Plaintiffs, being in pharmaceutical business,
            <lb />
            Defendants are well aware of Plaintiffs&apos; adoption and use of the trademarks
            <lb />
            and the action of the Defendants in adopting the marks and using them,
            <lb />
            amounts to infringement of the registered trademarks and copyright as well
            <lb />
            as passing off, unfair trade practice, etc. It is in this background that the
            <lb />
            present suit was filed by the Plaintiffs.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            20. Vide order dated 28.05.2021, ex-parte ad-interim injunction was
            <lb />
            granted by this Court in favour of the Plaintiffs. Summons were served on
            <lb />
            the Defendants. On 02.09.2021, Defendant No.1 was represented by a
            <lb />
            counsel, however, none appeared for Defendant No.2, despite service.
            <lb />
            Defendant No.2 was accordingly proceeded ex-parte. Despite opportunities,
            <lb />
            written statement was not filed on behalf of Defendant No.1 and since no
            <lb />
            one had appeared on behalf of Defendant No.1 on 25.11.2021 as well as on
            <lb />
            29.11.2021, Defendant No.1 was also proceeded ex-parte. It is pertinent to
            <lb />
            note that Defendant No.1 challenged the injunction order dated 28.05.2021
            <lb />
            before the Division Bench in FAO(OS)(COMM) 101/2021 but there was no
            <lb />
            appearance on behalf of the Appellant therein and accordingly, the appeal
            <lb />
            was dismissed in default and on account of non-prosecution, as reflected in
            <lb />
            the order of the Division Bench dated 28.01.2022, which is on record.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            21. Learned counsel for the Plaintiffs, at the outset, had urged the Court to
            <lb />
            proceed with hearing final arguments in the matter and submitted that since
            <lb />
            the Defendants were proceeded ex-parte and no written statement is filed,
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs are not required to file affidavit by way of evidence. It was further
            <lb />
            submitted that the averments in the plaint are duly supported by an affidavit
            <lb />
            and the same be read as an affidavit by way of evidence and the documents
            <lb />
            filed along with the plaint be looked into. To support the said contention,
            <lb />
            learned counsel relied on the judgments of Co-ordinate Benches of this
            <lb />
            Court in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Ors. vs. Hari Satya Lubricants &amp; Anr.,
            <lb />
            (2016) 234 DLT 524, The Indian Performing Right Society Ltd. vs.
            <lb />
            Gauhati Town Club and Anr., 2013 (134) DRJ 732 and United Coffee
            <lb />
            House vs. Raghav Kalra and Anr., 2013 (55) PTC 414 (Del).
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            22. Having perused the judgments in Aktiebolaget Volvo (supra), The
            <lb />
            Indian Performing Right Society Ltd. (supra) and United Coffee House
            <lb />
            (supra) and finding merit in the contention raised, Court had proceeded to
            <lb />
            hear the arguments without the Plaintiffs filing an affidavit by way of
            <lb />
            evidence. Be it noted that even today, there is no appearance on behalf of the
            <lb />
            Defendants to contest the suit and the averments in the plaint are unrebutted.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            23. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Plaintiffs contends that
            <lb />
            the Plaintiffs&apos; SUN (Device) constitutes an &apos;original artistic work&apos; within the
            <lb />
            meaning of Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act and that the copyright subsists
            <lb />
            in such artistic work under provisions of Section 13(1) of the said Act.
            <lb />
            Plaintiff No.1 is, therefore, the first owner of the copyright, having the
            <lb />
            exclusive right to use the same under provisions of Section 14 of the Act.
            <lb />
            Use of the impugned device mark by the Defendants is a colourable
            <lb />
            imitation and substantial reproduction of the Plaintiffs&apos; artistic work
            <lb />
            amounting to infringement of the copyright in the SUN (Device).
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            24. It was next contended that the impugned marks EYESITE/EYESITE
            <lb />
            (Label) and KL (Label) are visually, structurally and phonetically similar to
            <lb />
            the Plaintiffs&apos; registered trademark SUN (Device) and ISITE/I-SITE, I-SITE
            <lb />
            formative trademarks and thus, their use by the Defendants will cause
            <lb />
            confusion and deception, thereby constituting infringement of the Plaintiffs&apos;
            <lb />
            registered trademarks under Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            25. Next plank of argument of the Plaintiffs was that Plaintiffs&apos;
            <lb />
            trademarks have been extensively and commercially used by the Plaintiffs in
            <lb />
            the course of trade since 1993 for the SUN (Device) and since 1997 for the
            <lb />
            word marks. By virtue of prior adoption, extensive use, voluminous sales
            <lb />
            and substantial promotional expenses, coupled with extreme quality control
            <lb />
            exercised by the Plaintiffs, the said trademarks have acquired distinctiveness
            <lb />
            and formidable goodwill and reputation as a badge of quality products,
            <lb />
            originating from the Plaintiffs. The unauthorised use of the impugned marks
            <lb />
            EYESITE/EYESITE (Label) and KL (Label) by the Defendants is likely to
            <lb />
            cause confusion and/or deception in the minds of the consumers and
            <lb />
            constitutes acts of misrepresentation, misappropriation and passing off of the
            <lb />
            Defendants&apos; goods for those of the Plaintiffs and being an actionable tort, is
            <lb />
            liable to be injuncted.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            26. It was strenuously argued that the Defendants are also liable to be
            <lb />
            injuncted in the larger public interest considering that the goods in question
            <lb />
            are health supplements. The products in question fall in the category of
            <lb />
            pharmaceuticals and, therefore, strict standards are required to be applied to
            <lb />
            prevent likelihood of confusion, as this confusion may result in harmful and
            <lb />
            adverse effects on the consumers.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            27. I have heard the learned counsel for the Plaintiffs and perused the
            <lb />
            documents placed on record along with the plaint, which is duly supported
            <lb />
            by an affidavit.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            28. It emerges from the pleadings and the documents that the mark ISITE
            <lb />
            was coined by the Plaintiffs&apos; predecessor in the year 1997 and has been used
            <lb />
            for various medicinal and pharmaceutical products including health
            <lb />
            supplements. These supplements are combinations of vital vitamins and
            <lb />
            minerals, formulated to help in formation of blood cells, improving vision,
            <lb />
            treating acne and certain skin disorders as well as regulating blood pressure.
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs have placed on record trademark Registration Certificates for the
            <lb />
            trademark ISITE (word and device). The registrations are in Class 5, inter
            <lb />
            alia, for medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. There is no rebuttal
            <lb />
            either to the averments in this regard or to the Registration Certificates in the
            <lb />
            absence of written statement. Plaintiffs have established that they are the
            <lb />
            owners and registered proprietors of the trademarks ISITE (word and
            <lb />
            device) and thus have the exclusive right to use them. The registrations are
            <lb />
            valid and subsisting.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            29. Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act confers certain rights by virtue of
            <lb />
            registration, subject to other provisions of the said Act, including the
            <lb />
            exclusive right to use the trademark in relation to goods or services, in
            <lb />
            respect of which it is registered and to obtain relief in respect of
            <lb />
            infringement of the trademark in the manner provided under the Trade
            <lb />
            Marks Act. Therefore, clearly, two rights in favour of a registered proprietor
            <lb />
            of a trademark emanate from Section 28.

            <lb />
            OnLine Del 1619, a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court, relying on several
            <lb />
            judgments of the Supreme Court including the judgment in Kaviraj Pandit
            <lb />
            Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965
            <lb />

            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;31. It is settled law that in order to prove the case for
            <lb />
            infringement of trade mark, the plaintiff has to show that the
            <lb />
            essential features of the registered trade mark which has been
            <lb />
            adopted by the defendant has been taken out from the
            <lb />
            plaintiff&apos;s registration. Only the marks are to be compared by
            <lb />
            the Court and in case the registration is granted in favour of
            <lb />
            the plaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason of the said
            <lb />
            registration. The following are the judgments which are
            <lb />
            relevant to be referred for the purpose of infringement of the

            registered proprietor, uses in the course of trade a mark which
            <lb />
            is identical or deceptively similar in relation to the goods or
            <lb />
            services which are identical or similar to that in respect of
            <lb />
            which the trademark is registered without the permission of the
            <lb />
            trademark owner.&quot;
            <lb />

        <p>
            31. In the present case, Plaintiffs have, inter alia, alleged infringement of
            <lb />
            their registered trademarks. It would, therefore, be apposite to examine the
            <lb />
            provisions of Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, which provide the
            <lb />
            ingredients and constituent elements of infringement of registered
            <lb />
            trademarks. Section 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act provides that a registered
            <lb />
            trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or
            <lb />
            a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade a mark
            <lb />
            which is: (a) identical with or; (b) deceptively similar to, the trade mark in
            <lb />
            relation to goods or services in respect of which the trademark is registered
            <lb />
            and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as
            <lb />
            being used as a trademark. As per Section 29(2), a registered trademark is
            <lb />
            infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person
            <lb />
            using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which
            <lb />
            because of its: (a) identity with the registered trademark and similarity of the
            <lb />
            goods or services; or (b) similarity to the registered trademark and identity
            <lb />
            or similarity of the goods or services; or (c) identity with the registered
            <lb />
            trademark and identity of the goods or services, covered by such registered
            <lb />
            trademark is likely to cause confusion in public or have an association with
            <lb />
            the registered trademark. It is settled law that action for infringement is a
            <lb />
            statutory remedy available to the proprietor of a registered trademark to
            <lb />
            protect and vindicate his exclusive right to use of the trademark in relation to
            <lb />
            the goods/services for which it is registered.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            32.
            <lb />
            In a claim for infringement, it is a settled law that the Court is
            <lb />
            required to compare the two competing marks, i.e. registered mark of the
            <lb />
            Plaintiff and the allegedly infringing mark used by the Defendant, in the
            <lb />
            course of trade. Where the said two marks are identical, no further questions
            <lb />
            arise as infringement is made out. However, when the two marks are not
            <lb />
            identical, Plaintiff would have to establish that the impugned mark so
            <lb />
            closely resembles or is deceptively similar that it is likely to deceive or
            <lb />
            cause confusion in relation to the goods in respect of which the mark is
            <lb />
            registered. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea of
            <lb />
            the Plaintiff&apos;s mark. This proposition clearly flows from the judgment of the
            <lb />
            Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit (supra), relevant part of which is as
            <lb />
            follows:-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;29. When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is
            <lb />
            claimed to infringe the plaintiff&apos;s mark is shown to be &quot;in the
            <lb />
            course of trade&quot;, the question whether there has been an
            <lb />
            infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two marks.
            <lb />
            Where the two marks are identical no further questions arise;
            <lb />
            for then the infringement is made out. When the two marks
            <lb />
            are not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the
            <lb />
            mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff&apos;s
            <lb />
            registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion
            <lb />
            and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered
            <lb />
            (Vide Section 21). A point has sometimes been raised as to
            <lb />
            whether the words &quot;or cause confusion&quot; introduce any
            <lb />
            element which is not already covered by the words &quot;likely to
            <lb />
            deceive&quot; and it has sometimes been answered by saying that it
            <lb />
            is merely an extension of the earlier test and does not add very
            <lb />
            materially to the concept indicated by the earlier words &quot;likely
            <lb />
            to deceive&quot;. But this apart, as the question arises in an action
            <lb />
            for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish
            <lb />
            that the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of
            <lb />
            trade in the goods in respect of which his mark is registered, is
            <lb />
            deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be ascertained by a
            <lb />
            comparison of the two marks -the degree of resemblance
            <lb />
            which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being
            <lb />
            capable of definition by laying down objective standards. The
            <lb />
            persons who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers
            <lb />
            of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that
            <lb />
            is the subject of consideration. The resemblance may be
            <lb />
            phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the
            <lb />
            plaintiff&apos;s mark. The purpose of the comparison is for
            <lb />
            determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff&apos;s
            <lb />
            trade mark are to be found in that used by the defendant. The
            <lb />
            identification of the essential features of the mark is in essence
            <lb />
            a question of fact and depends on the judgment of the Court
            <lb />
            based on the evidence led before it as regards the usage of the
            <lb />
            trade. It should, however, be borne in mind that the object of
            <lb />
            the enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by
            <lb />
            the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the
            <lb />
            registered mark of the plaintiff.&quot;

        <p>
            33. The test which has been laid down over the years in several judgments
            <lb />
            for comparing the registered trademark vis-à-vis the infringing mark is that
            <lb />
            the two marks have to be considered as a whole and the question has to be
            <lb />
            approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and
            <lb />
            imperfect recollection. In Corn Products Refining Co. vs. Shangrila Food
            <lb />
            Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968, the Supreme Court was dealing with an
            <lb />
            application for registration of a mark &apos;Gluvita&apos; in respect of biscuits
            <lb />
            manufactured by the Respondent, which was opposed by Corn Products,
            <lb />
            who had registration in the mark &apos;Glucovita&apos; in respect of Glucose powder,
            <lb />
            used as an ingredient in food items. The opposition was rejected by the
            <lb />
            Registrar and the litigation between the parties finally reached the Supreme
            <lb />
            Court. After analysing the matter, the Supreme Court, disagreeing with the
            <lb />
            Registrar of Trade Marks that the syllable &apos;co&apos; between the syllables &apos;Glu&apos;
            <lb />
            and &apos;vi&apos; was enough to ensure that there was no likelihood of confusion,
            <lb />
            held as follows:-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;15. Now it is a well recognised principle, that has to be
            <lb />
            taken into account in considering the possibility of confusion
            <lb />
            arising between any two trademarks, that, where those two
            <lb />
            marks contain a common element which is also contained in a
            <lb />
            number of other marks in use in the same market such a
            <lb />
            common occurrence in the market tends to cause purchasers to
            <lb />
            pay more attention to the other features of the respective marks
            <lb />
            and to distinguish between them by those features. This
            <lb />
            principle clearly requires that the marks comprising the
            <lb />
            common element shall be in fairly extensive use and, as I have
            <lb />
            mentioned, in use in the market in which the marks under
            <lb />
            consideration are being or will be used.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            16. The series of marks containing the common element or
            <lb />
            elements therefore only assist the applicant when those marks
            <lb />
            are in extensive use in the market. The onus of proving such
            <lb />
            user is of course on the applicant, who wants to rely on those
            <lb />
            marks. Now in the present case the applicant, the respondent
            <lb />
            before us, led no evidence as to the user of marks with the
            <lb />
            common element. What had happened was that the Deputy
            <lb />
            Registrar looked into his register and found there a large
            <lb />
            number of marks which had either &apos;Gluco&apos; or &apos;Vita&apos; as prefix
            <lb />
            or suffix in it. Now of course the presence of a mark in the
            <lb />
            register does not prove its user at all. It is possible that the
            <lb />
            mark may have been registered but not used. It is not
            <lb />
            permissible to draw any inference as to their user from the
            <lb />
            presence of the marks on the register. If any authority on this
            <lb />
            question is considered necessary, reference may be made to
            <lb />
            Kerly p. 507 and Willesden Varnish Co. Ltd. v. Young &amp;
            <lb />
            Marten Ltd. It also appears that the appellant itself stated in
            <lb />
            one of the affidavits used on its behalf that there were biscuits
            <lb />
            in the market bearing the marks &apos;Glucose Biscuits&apos;, &apos;Gluco
            <lb />
            biscuits&apos; and &apos;Glucoa Lactine biscuits&apos;. But these marks do not
            <lb />
            help the respondent in the present case. They are ordinary
            <lb />
            dictionary words in which no one has any right. They are
            <lb />
            really not marks with a common element or elements. We,
            <lb />
            therefore, think that the learned appellate Judges were in error
            <lb />
            in deciding in favour of the respondent basing themselves on
            <lb />
            the series marks, having &apos;Gluco&apos; or &apos;Vita&apos; as a prefix or a
            <lb />
            suffix.

            18. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It is
            <lb />
            well known that the question whether the two marks are likely
            <lb />
            to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression.
            <lb />
            It is for the court to decide that question. English cases
            <lb />
            proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English
            <lb />
            word by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not always the
            <lb />
            same, may not be of much assistance in our country in
            <lb />
            deciding questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot be
            <lb />
            overlooked that the word is an English word which to the mass
            <lb />
            of the Indian people is a foreign word. It is well recognised
            <lb />
            that in deciding a question of similarity between two marks,
            <lb />
            the marks have to be considered as a whole. So considered,
            <lb />
            we are inclined to agree with Desai, J., that the marks with
            <lb />
            which this case is concerned are similar. Apart from the
            <lb />
            syllable &quot;co&quot; in the appellant&apos;s mark, the two marks are
            <lb />
            identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as would
            <lb />
            enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark
            <lb />
            from the other.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            19. We also agree with Desai, J., that the idea of the two
            <lb />
            marks is the same. The marks convey the ideas of glucose and
            <lb />
            life giving properties of vitamins. The Aquamatic case (Harry
            <lb />
            Reynolds v. Laffeaty&apos;s Ld.) is a recent case where the test of the
            <lb />
            commonness of the idea between two marks was applied in
            <lb />
            deciding the question of similarity between them. Again, in
            <lb />
            deciding the question of similarity between the two marks we
            <lb />
            have to approach it from the point of view of a man of
            <lb />
            average intelligence and of imperfect recollection. To such a
            <lb />
            man the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the
            <lb />
            similarity of the idea in the two marks is reasonably likely to
            <lb />
            cause a confusion between them.&quot;

            34. Another judgment of the Supreme Court, which is relevant to the
            <lb />
            present case is in the case of Amritdhara Pharmacy vs. Satya Deo Gupta,
            <lb />
            (1963) 2 SCR 484. The issue before the Supreme Court in the said matter
            <lb />
            was the registration of the trade name &apos;Lakshmandhara&apos; by the Respondent
            <lb />
            therein, which, according to the Respondent, had acquired a distinctiveness,
            <lb />
            being used since 1923, in respect of a biochemical medicinal preparation.
            <lb />
            Registration was opposed by the Appellant on the ground that the word
            <lb />
            &apos;Amritdhara&apos; was registered as a trade name for medicinal preparation and
            <lb />
            was in use much prior and had attained popularity. The Supreme Court held
            <lb />
            that the two names were in respect of the same description of goods, i.e.
            <lb />
            medicinal preparation, which were likely to be purchased by the literate as
            <lb />
            well as the illiterate. Relying on the test laid down in Corn Products (supra)
            <lb />
            that the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of
            <lb />
            average intelligence and imperfect recollection, the Supreme Court held that
            <lb />
            to such a man, the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two
            <lb />
            names is likely to deceive or cause confusion. It was also held that a critical
            <lb />
            comparison of the two marks may disclose some points of difference but to
            <lb />
            such a man, overall similarity of the two marks, having regard to the nature
            <lb />
            of medicine he is looking for with a vague recollection of having purchased
            <lb />
            a similar medicine on an earlier occasion, could cause confusion. Paras 7

            and 8 of the said judgment are as follow:-

            &quot;7. Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our
            <lb />
            consideration. It is not disputed before us that the two names
            <lb />
            &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshman-dhara&quot; are in use in respect of
            <lb />
            the same description of goods, namely a medicinal preparation
            <lb />
            for the alleviation of various ailments. Such medicinal
            <lb />
            preparation will be purchased mostly by people who instead
            <lb />
            of going to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for the
            <lb />
            quick alleviation of their suffering, both villagers and
            <lb />
            townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate. As we said in Corn
            <lb />
            Products Refining Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd. [(1960)
            <lb />
            (1) SCR 968] the question has to be approached from the point
            <lb />
            of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect
            <lb />
            recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic
            <lb />
            similarity-of
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            two
            <lb />
            names
            <lb />
            &quot;Amritdhara&quot;
            <lb />
            and
            <lb />
            &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause
            <lb />
            confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two
            <lb />
            composite words &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. We
            <lb />
            do not think that the learned Judges of the High Court were
            <lb />
            right in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other.
            <lb />
            An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
            <lb />
            recollection would not, as the High Court supposed, split the
            <lb />
            name into its component parts and consider the etymological
            <lb />
            meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the
            <lb />
            composite words as &quot;current of nectar&quot; or &quot;current of
            <lb />
            Lakshman&quot;. He would go more by the overall structural and
            <lb />
            phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine he has
            <lb />
            previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which
            <lb />
            has otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase. Where
            <lb />
            the trade relates to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly
            <lb />
            educated persons, it is no answer to say that a person educated
            <lb />
            in the Hindi language would go by the etymological or
            <lb />
            ideological meaning and see the difference between &quot;current
            <lb />
            of nectar&quot; and &quot;current of Lakshman&quot;. &quot;Current of
            <lb />
            Lakshman&quot; in a literal sense has no meaning; to give it
            <lb />
            meaning one must further make the inference that the &quot;current
            <lb />
            or stream&quot; is as pure and strong as Lakshman of the
            <lb />
            Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or townsman will
            <lb />
            perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the Ramayana being
            <lb />
            familiar to him; but we doubt if he would etymologise to the
            <lb />
            extent of seeing the so-called ideological difference between
            <lb />
            &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. He would go more by
            <lb />
            the similarity of the two names in the context of the widely
            <lb />
            known medicinal preparation which he wants for his
            <lb />
            ailments.

            8.
            <lb />
            We agree that the use of the word &quot;dhara&quot; which
            <lb />
            literally means &quot;current or stream&quot; is not by itself decisive of
            <lb />
            the matter. What we have to consider here is the overall
            <lb />
            similarity of the composite words, having regard to the
            <lb />
            circumstance that the goods bearing the two names are
            <lb />
            medicinal preparations of the same description. We are aware
            <lb />
            that the admission of a mark is not to be refused, because
            <lb />
            unusually stupid people, &quot;fools or idiots&quot;, may be deceived. A
            <lb />
            critical comparison of the two names may disclose some
            <lb />
            points of difference, but an unwary purchaser of average
            <lb />
            intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived by
            <lb />
            the overall similarity of the two names having regard to the
            <lb />
            nature of the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat
            <lb />
            vague recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine
            <lb />
            on a previous occasion with a similar name. The trade mark
            <lb />
            is the whole thing-the whole word has to be considered. In the
            <lb />
            case of the application to register &quot;Erectiks&quot; (opposed by the
            <lb />
            proprietors of the trade mark &quot;Erector&quot;) Farwell, J., said
            <lb />
            in William Bailey (Birmingham) Ltd. Application [(1935) 52
            <lb />
            RPC 137] :
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            &quot;I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and
            <lb />
            compare it with a part of the other word; one word must
            <lb />
            be considered as a whole and compared with the other
            <lb />
            word as a whole…. I think it is a dangerous method to
            <lb />
            adopt to divide the word up and seek to distinguish a
            <lb />
            portion of it from a portion of the other word.&quot;
            <lb />

        <p>
            35. It is relevant to note that the Supreme Court in the aforementioned
            <lb />
            case placed reliance on the observations of Parker J. in Pianotist Co. Ltd&apos;s
            <lb />
            application [23 RPC 774 at 777] as under:-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by
            <lb />
            their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to
            <lb />
            which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and
            <lb />
            kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In
            <lb />
            fact, you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and
            <lb />
            you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of
            <lb />
            those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for
            <lb />
            the goods of the respective owners of the marks. If, considering
            <lb />
            all those circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there
            <lb />
            will be a confusion, that is to say, not necessarily that one man
            <lb />
            will be injured and the other will gain illicit benefit, but that
            <lb />
            there will be a confusion in the mind of the public which will
            <lb />
            lead to confusion in the goods -then you may refuse the
            <lb />
            registration, or rather you must refuse the registration in that
            <lb />
            case.&quot;

            36. In Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. &amp; Co., Mysore, AIR 1972 SC 1359,
            <lb />
            the Supreme Court held as follows:-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;According to Karly&apos;s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names
            <lb />
            (9 th Edition Paragraph 838) &quot;Two marks, when placed side by
            <lb />
            side, may exhibit many and various differences, yet the main
            <lb />
            idea left on the mind by both may be the same. A person
            <lb />
            acquainted with the one mark, and not having the two side by
            <lb />
            side for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were
            <lb />
            allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a belief
            <lb />
            that he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as
            <lb />
            that with which he was acquainted.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with
            <lb />
            trademarked goods, and relying, as they frequently do, upon
            <lb />
            marks, should be able to remember the exact details of the
            <lb />
            marks upon the goods with which they are in the habit of
            <lb />
            dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general impressions
            <lb />
            or by some significant detail than by any photographic
            <lb />
            recollection of the whole. Moreover, variations in detail might
            <lb />
            well be supposed by customers to have been made by the
            <lb />
            owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for
            <lb />
            reasons of their own.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion
            <lb />
            whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad
            <lb />
            and essential features of the two are to be considered. They
            <lb />
            should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any
            <lb />
            differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such
            <lb />
            character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the
            <lb />
            other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an
            <lb />
            overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to
            <lb />
            mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other
            <lb />
            if offered to him.&quot;

        <p>
            37. In K.R. Chinna Krishana Chettiar vs. Shri Ambal and Co., Madras
            <lb />
            and Anr., (1969) 2 SCC 131, the question before the Supreme Court was
            <lb />
            whether the proposed mark of the Appellant was deceptively similar to the
            <lb />
            Respondent&apos;s mark. It was held that the resemblance in the two marks must
            <lb />
            be considered with reference to the ear as well as the eye, as ocular
            <lb />
            comparison may not always be a decisive test. Therefore, even if there is no
            <lb />
            visual resemblance between the two competing marks, a close affinity of
            <lb />
            sound could be a decisive factor. On the basis of phonetic similarity and
            <lb />
            affinity of sound between the words &apos;AMBAL&apos; and &apos;ANDAL&apos;, the Supreme
            <lb />
            Court held that they were deceptively similar, despite the fact that they had
            <lb />
            distinct meanings and represented separate divinities. Reliance was placed
            <lb />
            on an earlier judgment of the Supreme Court in De Cordova vs. Vick
            <lb />
            Chemical Co., 1951 68 RPC 103, wherein it was held that the Defendants
            <lb />
            by advertising their ointment as &apos;Karsote Vapour Rub&apos; had infringed the
            <lb />
            registered marks of the Plaintiffs, who were proprietors of the registered
            <lb />
            trademarks &apos;Vaporub&apos;. Lord Radcliffe observed that a mark is infringed by
            <lb />
            another trader if, even without using the whole of it upon or in connection
            <lb />
            with his goods, he uses one or more of its essential features.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            38. In F.Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. Ltd. vs. Geoffrey Manners &amp; Co.
            <lb />
            Pvt. Ltd., (1969) 2 SCC 716, the Supreme Court was dealing with the
            <lb />
            question as to whether the mark &apos;Dropovit&apos; was deceptively similar to
            <lb />
            &apos;Protovit&apos; within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Trade and
            <lb />
            Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. It was held that the marks must be compared
            <lb />
            as a whole. It is not right to take a portion of the word, dissect it and then
            <lb />
            hold that a part of the word differs from the competing mark and thus, there
            <lb />
            is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion. The true test is whether the
            <lb />
            totality of the proposed trademark is such that it is likely to cause deception
            <lb />
            or confusion in the mind of the persons accustomed to the existing
            <lb />
            trademark. Reliance was placed on the Lavroma case [Tokalon
            <lb />
            Ltd. v. Davidson &amp; Co., 32 RPC at 133 at 136] case where Lord Johnston
            <lb />
            observed that the comparison of marks is not a matter for microscopic
            <lb />
            inspection but is to be taken from the general and even casual point of view
            <lb />
            of a customer walking into a shop.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            39. Another relevant judgment in the context of phonetic similarity is in
            <lb />
            the case of M/s. Hitachi Ltd. v. Ajay Kr. Agarwal and Ors., 1995 (2) Arb.
            <lb />
            LR 348, wherein Division Bench of this Court was dealing with the question
            <lb />
            of similarity between two trademarks &apos;Hitachi&apos; and &apos;Hitaish&apos;. Applying the
            <lb />
            test of the point of view of an average man with imperfect memory, the
            <lb />
            Court held that the two marks, one written in English and the other in Hindi
            <lb />
            may be visually dissimilar on account of the difference in the script,
            <lb />
            however, there was a marked phonetic similarity since the two words are
            <lb />
            pronounced in almost the same way and an average purchaser will not be
            <lb />
            able to differentiate the two when he goes to purchase the product. This,
            <lb />
            according to the Division Bench, was likely to cause confusion and
            <lb />
            deception.
        </p>
        <lb />
        <p>
            40. Relevant would it be to refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in
            <lb />
            Cadila Health Care vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73,
            <lb />
            wherein the Supreme Court disagreed with the observations of the Supreme
            <lb />
            Court in an earlier judgment in S.M. Dyechem Ltd. vs. Cadbury (India)
            <lb />
            Ltd., (2000) 5 SCC 573, wherein it was held that stress must be laid on
            <lb />
            common features rather on differences in essential features and went on to
            <lb />
            hold that the real test is to see the similarity in the competing marks.
            <lb />
            Supreme Court examined the test applied in the S.M. Dyechem Ltd.&apos;s case
            <lb />
            wherein the marks &quot;PIKNIK&quot; and &quot;PICNIC&quot; were under examination viz.
            <lb />
            (i) is there any special aspect of the common feature which has been copied?
            <lb />
            (ii) mode in which the parts are put together differently, i.e. whether
            <lb />
            dissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to make the whole thing
            <lb />
            dissimilar? and (iii) whether, when there are common elements, should one
            <lb />
            not pay more regard to the parts which are not common? Applying the three
            <lb />
            tests, the Supreme Court in S.M. Dyechem Ltd.(supra) had come to a
            <lb />
            conclusion that seeing the manner in which the two words were written and
            <lb />
            the peculiarity of the script, the words were dissimilar despite the phonetic
            <lb />
            similarity in the two marks. In Cadila Health Care (supra), the Supreme
            <lb />
            Court held that the Court was unable to agree that the principle of phonetic
            <lb />
            similarity has to be jettisoned when the manner in which the competing
            <lb />
            words are written is different and that the tests followed in S.M. Dyechem
            <lb />
            Ltd.(supra) were contrary to the binding precedent of the Supreme Court in
            <lb />
            Amritdhara Pharmacy (supra).
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            41. Useful would it be to refer to the case of Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd. vs.
            <lb />
            Zamindara Engineering Co., (1969) 2 SCC 727, wherein the Appellant
            <lb />
            before the Supreme Court was a registered proprietor of the trademark
            <lb />
            &quot;RUSTON&quot; in class 7 in respect of diesel internal combustion engines.
            <lb />
            Respondent was found using the trademarks &quot;RUSTAM&quot; and &quot;RUSTAM
            <lb />
            INDIA&quot;. The Supreme Court held that the trademark &quot;RUSTAM&quot; was
            <lb />
            deceptively similar to the Appellants trademark &quot;RUSTON&quot; and mere
            <lb />
            addition of the word &quot;INDIA&quot; was of no consequence and the Appellant was
            <lb />
            thus entitled to succeed in its action for infringement of its trademark.
            <lb />
            Before drawing curtains on the aspect of confusing similarity and/or identity
            <lb />
            of trademarks, since the products in question in the present case are health
            <lb />
            supplements, it would be pertinent to refer to the observations of the
            <lb />
            Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care (supra). The Supreme Court held that
            <lb />
            in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, a much lower threshold is to be
            <lb />
            applied to determine confusing similarity while comparing the competing
            <lb />
            marks. This aspect has been brought out in a later part of this judgement.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            42.
            <lb />
            Coming to the present case and applying the principles enunciated in
            <lb />
            the aforesaid judgments viz. (i) competing marks have to be seen as a whole;
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            (ii) marks are not to be kept side by side for comparison and are not to be
            <lb />
            dissected or compared syllable by syllable; (iii) if the marks are visually
            <lb />
            and/or phonetically identical or similar, confusion/deception is likely to
            <lb />
            occur; and (iv) public interest supports lesser degree of proof showing
            <lb />
            confusing similarity in case of trademarks in respect of medicinal and
            <lb />
            pharmaceutical products, in the opinion of this Court, Plaintiffs&apos; registered
            <lb />
            mark ISITE, when compared as a whole with the impugned mark EYESITE,
            <lb />
            leaves no doubt that they are phonetically identical and visually similar.
            <lb />
            When both the words are articulated, an ordinary prudent man would be
            <lb />
            unable to distinguish them by their sounds and there would be likelihood of
            <lb />
            deception and confusion on account of their phonetic identity. While it may
            <lb />
            be true that the trademark of the Plaintiffs has a prefix &apos;I&apos; to the word &apos;SITE&apos;
            <lb />
            while that of the Defendants has a prefix &apos;EYE&apos; and a critical comparison of
            <lb />
            the two marks may disclose some difference, however, the likelihood of
            <lb />
            confusion and deception on account of phonetic identity and overall
            <lb />
            similarity of the two marks, when taken as a whole, cannot be ruled out
            <lb />
            albeit the test is of phonetic similarity and not identity. It needs no
            <lb />
            reiteration that phonetic identity or similarity is an important index of
            <lb />
            similarity or deceptive similarity of one mark against the other competing
            <lb />
            mark and the tests of phonetic, visual and structural similarity or identity are
            <lb />
            disjunctive and not conjunctive.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            43. Furthermore, use of the letters &quot;EYE&quot; in the impugned trademark by
            <lb />
            the Defendants, in my view, would be inconsequential in view of the clear
            <lb />
            law laid down by the Supreme Court and this Court that the question really
            <lb />
            is of the first impression, which is especially true in case of phonetic
            <lb />
            similarity where a meticulous comparison of the words, syllable by syllable
            <lb />
            is to be avoided, keeping room for callous pronunciation and speech of not
            <lb />
            only the unwary purchaser but also the shopkeeper. Examined on the said
            <lb />
            anvil and viewed from the perspective of a person with imperfect
            <lb />
            recollection, there is no doubt that &quot;EYESITE&quot; and &quot;ISITE&quot; are phonetically
            <lb />
            identical and the mere difference between the spellings &quot;EYE&quot; and &quot;I&quot; will
            <lb />
            not render the marks phonetically dissimilar. In the present case, not only
            <lb />
            are the marks phonetically identical, there is similarity in products, i.e.
            <lb />
            health supplements as well as identity of trade channels and customer base
            <lb />
            and, therefore, the triple identity test, which has been evolved over the years
            <lb />
            stands satisfied.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            44. Another factor, which weighs in favour of the Plaintiffs, is that
            <lb />
            Defendant No.1 had filed a trademark application dated 24.11.2018 under
            <lb />
            No. 4006600 for registration of the trademark &quot;EYESITE&quot; (word) on
            <lb />
            &quot;Proposed to be Used&quot; basis in class 5 for the goods &quot;medicinal and
            <lb />
            pharmaceutical preparations included in class 5&quot;. An affidavit was also filed
            <lb />
            to state that Defendant No.1 had been using the mark since 11.02.2019 and
            <lb />
            had placed invoices dated 13.02.2019 and 05.08.2019 on record. The request
            <lb />
            for registration was refused by the Registrar of Trade Marks vide order dated
            <lb />
            13.03.2020, on the ground of being objectionable under Section 9(1)(a) and
            <lb />
            9(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act and the order was not assailed by the
            <lb />
            Defendants and has attained finality. Relevant would it be also to note that
            <lb />
            the application filed by the Defendants under No.4931158 dated 02.04.2021,
            <lb />
            for registration of the trademark
            <lb />
            EYESITE (Label)
            <lb />
            on &quot;Proposed to be Used&quot; basis in class 5, for goods namely &apos;pharmaceutical
            <lb />
            and medicine preparations&apos;, is stated to be pending before the Trade Marks
            <lb />
            Registry, as objection has been raised under Section 9(1)(b) of the Trade
            <lb />
            Marks Act.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            45. On the above analysis, this Court comes to the conclusion that use of
            <lb />
            the marks &quot;EYESITE&quot;/ &apos;
            <lb />
            &apos; by the Defendants, which
            <lb />
            are deceptively similar to the mark &quot;ISITE&quot; of the Plaintiffs, is likely to
            <lb />
            confuse the consumers of similar products and dilute the distinctive
            <lb />
            character of the said mark, resulting in erosion of their goodwill and
            <lb />
            reputation. Courts have repeatedly applied a lower threshold of proving
            <lb />
            deceptive similarity in the case of medicinal products, since confusion
            <lb />
            between the two marks is likely to have a deleterious effect on the public.
            <lb />
            The adoption and use of the impugned marks by the Defendants in relation
            <lb />
            to health in my view, meets the said threshold and amounts to
            <lb />
            infringement of the Plaintiffs&apos; statutory rights in the registered trademark
            <lb />
            &quot;ISITE&quot;.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            46. The next plank of the argument of the learned counsel for the
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs was that the use of the mark
            <lb />
            by the Defendants
            <lb />
            amounts to infringement of Plaintiffs&apos; registered mark i.e. SUN logo
            <lb />
            . It is the pleaded case of the Plaintiffs that the Defendants have a
            <lb />
            valid
            <lb />
            and
            <lb />
            subsisting
            <lb />
            registration
            <lb />
            in
            <lb />
            the
            <lb />
            composite
            <lb />
            mark
            <lb />
            in Class 5, for which they had applied on
            <lb />
            18.12.2018 and secured registration on 21.05.2021.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            47. A bare look at the two marks would show that they are not identical.
            <lb />
            The question that next arises is whether the mark of the Defendants is
            <lb />
            similar to that of the Plaintiffs, so as to cause deception or confusion in
            <lb />
            relation to the goods for which the Plaintiffs&apos; mark is registered. The
            <lb />
            answer, in my opinion, is an emphatic &apos;no&apos;. Defendants&apos; registered mark is a
            <lb />
            composite mark consisting of: (a) a circular device with four spheres, which
            <lb />
            are not interlocking and contains a spiked wheel in the centre, embossed
            <lb />
            with the letters &quot;KL&quot;; (b) &quot;Kinetic Lifescience&quot; prominently written in a
            <lb />
            stylized font; (c) words &quot;OPC Private Limited&quot; written in capitals, below
            <lb />
            &quot;Kinetic Lifescience&quot;; and (d) the motto of the Defendants, &quot;Our Mission
            <lb />
            Healthy People&quot; appearing at the bottom of the mark. Component (a) covers
            <lb />
            one-third of the composite mark on the left side, while the remaining
            <lb />
            two-thirds is covered by components (b) to (d). The colour scheme
            <lb />
            throughout the composite mark is purple and fuchsia and it is also relevant
            <lb />
            to note that it is neither borne out from the pleadings nor the documents on
            <lb />
            record that component (a) is used by the Defendants separately for their
            <lb />
            products.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            48. Compared and contrasted with the Defendants&apos; mark, the device mark
            <lb />
            of the Plaintiffs, has four interlocked spheres and the colour scheme is a
            <lb />
            combination of peach and orange. Learned counsel for the Plaintiffs sought
            <lb />
            to compare component (a), i.e. the circular device, with the SUN logo of the
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs. This approach clearly contradicts the &quot;Anti-Dissection Rule&quot;,
            <lb />
            according to which, two marks have to be considered as a whole rather than
            <lb />
            truncating or dissecting them in parts and then comparing the component
            <lb />
            parts albeit constituent parts can be seen as a preliminary step to determine
            <lb />
            the ultimate impression that a customer may have when the conflicting
            <lb />
            marks are seen as a whole. This principle has been enunciated by a Division
            <lb />
            Bench of this Court in M/s. South India Beverages Pvt. Ltd. vs. General
            <lb />
            Mills Marketing, 2014 SCCOnLine Del 1953.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            49. Examined on the touchstone of the aforesaid principle and viewing
            <lb />
            the competing marks as a whole, it is not possible for this Court to accept
            <lb />
            that the impugned mark
            <lb />
            is similar to the SUN
            <lb />
            logo
            <lb />
            of the Plaintiffs so as to cause confusion or an association
            <lb />
            with the Plaintiffs. In fact, the three remaining components of the
            <lb />
            Defendants&apos; composite mark, i.e. components (b), (c) and (d), when seen as
            <lb />
            a whole with component (a), clearly distinguish the two marks such that a
            <lb />
            man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection cannot be confused.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            50. Furthermore, it is not even the pleaded case of the Plaintiffs that
            <lb />
            component (a) is the &quot;dominant&quot; part of the mark, such that it can be
            <lb />
            exempted from strict application of the anti-dissection rule. Even otherwise,
            <lb />
            it is evident that component (a) as well as the letters &apos;KL&apos;, representing the
            <lb />
            initials of the Defendants&apos; firm, are dominant parts of the Defendants&apos; mark
            <lb />
            and it cannot be said that the two marks are deceptively similar. Plaintiffs
            <lb />
            have relied on various Court orders granting protection with respect to
            <lb />
            device marks similar to Plaintiffs&apos; SUN logo. Bare perusal of the table
            <lb />
            extracted in para 14 above shows that the infringing marks therein have
            <lb />
            striking identity with and/or similarity to the Plaintiffs&apos; SUN (device), which
            <lb />
            is not the case here. The impugned device mark of the Defendants, as
            <lb />
            brought out above, is wholly dissimilar to the Plaintiffs&apos; device mark. This
            <lb />
            contention of the Plaintiffs is thus rejected, being devoid of merit.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            51. Even otherwise, if the Plaintiffs&apos; contention was to be considered
            <lb />
            de hors the rule of anti-dissection qua a composite mark, it is evident that
            <lb />
            the SUN logo of the Plaintiffs and component (a) of the Defendants&apos; mark,
            <lb />
            i.e. the circular device, are neither identical nor similar so as to cause
            <lb />
            confusion in the mind of the public. The SUN logo of the Plaintiffs has four
            <lb />
            interlocked spheres with the colour scheme being a combination of peach
            <lb />
            and orange, while that of the Defendants&apos; circular device has four spheres
            <lb />
            which are not interlocking with a colour scheme of purple and fuchsia.
            <lb />
            Besides, the sphere contains the letters &quot;KL&quot;, representing the initials of the
            <lb />
            Defendants&apos; firm and form a key differentiating feature from the Plaintiffs&apos;
            <lb />
            SUN logo, which has an empty core. Thus, judged from the perspective of a
            <lb />
            purchaser with average intelligence and imperfect recollection, it cannot be
            <lb />
            argued by the Plaintiffs that the overall impression so created would lead to
            <lb />
            confusion or association.

            52. The final contention of the Plaintiffs that requires consideration is
            <lb />
            whether the Defendants have passed off the products of the Plaintiffs. Law
            <lb />
            with respect to passing off is well settled by several judgments of the
            <lb />
            Supreme Court and various High Courts. In order to avoid prolixity, I may
            <lb />
            only refer to a recent judgment of a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in FDC
            <lb />
            Ltd. vs. Faraway Foods Pvt. Ltd., 2021 SCC Online Del 1539, wherein the
            <lb />
            following principles in relation to the tort of passing off have been culled
            <lb />
            out, relying on the judicial precedents:-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;75. From the aforenoted decisions, the following clear
            <lb />
            principles emerge:
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (i) Passing off, though an action based on deceit, does not
            <lb />
            require the establishment of fraud as a necessary element to
            <lb />
            sustain the action. Imitation or adoption, by the defendant, of
            <lb />
            the plaintiffs trade mark, in such manner as to cause confusion
            <lb />
            or deception in the mind of prospective customers, is sufficient.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (ii) The principles for grant of injunction, in passing off
            <lb />
            actions, are the same as those which govern the grant of
            <lb />
            injunctions in other cases, i.e. the existence of a prima
            <lb />
            facie case, the balance of convenience, and the likelihood of
            <lb />
            irreparable loss in issuing to the plaintiff, were injunction not
            <lb />
            to be granted.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (iii) Proof of actual damage is not necessary, to establish
            <lb />
            passing off. However, proof of misrepresentation is necessary,
            <lb />
            even if intent to misrepresent is not approved. The question of
            <lb />
            intent may, nevertheless, be relevant, when it comes to the
            <lb />
            ultimate relief to be granted to the plaintiff.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (iv) Passing off may be alleged by a claimant who owns
            <lb />
            sufficient proprietary interest in the goodwill associated with
            <lb />
            the product, which is really likely to be damaged by the alleged
            <lb />
            misrepresentation.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (v) Grant of injunction, in cases where passing off is found to
            <lb />
            exist, is intended to serve two purposes, the first being
            <lb />
            preservation of the reputation of the plaintiff, and the second,
            <lb />
            safeguarding of the public against goods which are &quot;passed
            <lb />
            off as those of the plaintiff.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (vi) The ingredients/indicia of the tort of passing off are the
            <lb />
            following:
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (a) There must be sale, by the defendant, of
            <lb />
            goods/services in a manner which is likely to deceive
            <lb />
            the public into thinking that the goods/services are
            <lb />
            those of the plaintiff.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (b) The plaintiff is not required to prove long user to
            <lb />
            prove established reputation. The existence, or
            <lb />
            otherwise, of reputation, would depend upon the
            <lb />
            volume of the plaintiffs sales and the extent of its
            <lb />
            advertisement.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (c) The plaintiff is required to establish
            <lb />
            (i) misrepresentation by the defendant to the
            <lb />
            public, though not necessarily mala fide,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (ii) likelihood of confusion in the minds of the
            <lb />
            public (the public being the potential
            <lb />
            customers/users of the product) that the goods
            <lb />
            of the defendant are those of the plaintiff,
            <lb />
            applying the test of a person of &quot;imperfect
            <lb />
            recollection and ordinary memory&quot;,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (iii) loss, or likelihood of loss, and
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (iv) goodwill of the plaintiff, as a prior user.
            <lb />
            Elsewhere, the five elements of passing off
            <lb />
            have been identified as (a) misrepresentation,
            <lb />
            (b) made by the trader in the course of trade,
            <lb />
            (c) to prospective customers or ultimate
            <lb />
            consumers of the goods or services supplied by
            <lb />
            him, (d) calculated to injure the business or
            <lb />
            goodwill of another (i.e. that such injury is
            <lb />
            reasonably foreseeable) and (e) actual
            <lb />
            damage, or the possibility of actual damage, to
            <lb />
            the business or goodwill of the plaintiff.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (vii) In cases of alleged passing off, the Court, while examining
            <lb />
            the likelihood of causing confusion, is required to consider, in
            <lb />
            conjunction, inter alia,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (a) the nature of the market,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (b) the class of customers dealing in the product,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (c) the extent of reputation possessed by the plaintiff,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (d) the trade channels through which the product is
            <lb />
            made available to the customer and
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (e) the existence of connection in the course of
            <lb />
            trade. The Supreme Court has also held that, in
            <lb />
            passing off action on the basis of unregistered trade
            <lb />
            marks, the Court is required to assess the likelihood
            <lb />
            of deception or confusion by examining
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (i) the nature of the marks, i.e. whether there
            <lb />
            were demands/label marks/composite marks,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (ii) the degree of similarity between the
            <lb />
            competing marks,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (iii) the nature of the goods,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (iv) the similarity in nature, character and
            <lb />
            performance of the goods of the rival parties,
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (v) the class of purchasers, and the degree of
            <lb />
            care which they would be expected to exercise
            <lb />
            while purchasing the goods, and
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (vi) the mode of purchasing the goods and
            <lb />
            placing orders.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (viii) That the defendant is not producing the
            <lb />
            goods manufactured by the plaintiff may not be
            <lb />
            relevant, where the plaintiff&apos; s mark is found to
            <lb />
            have sufficient reputation.
        </item>
        <lb />
        <item>
            (ix) Courts are required to be doubly vigilant
            <lb />
            where passing off is alleged in respect of
            <lb />
            pharmaceutical products, in view of the
            <lb />
            possibility of adverse effects resulting from
            <lb />
            administration of a wrong drug. For the said
            <lb />
            reason, the degree of proof is also lower, in
            <lb />
            the case of alleged passing of pharmaceutical
            <lb />
            products.
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (x) Passing off differs from infringement.
            <lb />
            Passing off is based on the goodwill that the
            <lb />
            trader has in his name, whereas infringement
            <lb />
            is based on the trader&apos;s proprietary right in the
            <lb />
            name, registered in his favour. Passing off is
            <lb />
            an action for deceit, involving passing off the
            <lb />
            goods of one person as those of another,
            <lb />
            whereas an action for infringement is a
            <lb />
            statutory remedy conferred on the registered
            <lb />
            proprietor of a registered trade mark for
            <lb />
            vindication of its exclusive right to use the
            <lb />
            trade mark in relation to the goods in respect
            <lb />
            of which registration has been granted. Use of
            <lb />
            the trade mark by the defendant is not
            <lb />
            necessary for infringement, but it is a sine qua
            <lb />
            non for passing off. Once sufficient similarity,
            <lb />
            as is likely to deceive, is shown, infringement
            <lb />
            stands established. Passing off, however, may
            <lb />
            be resisted on the ground of added material,
            <lb />
            such as packing, procurement through
            <lb />
            different trade channels, etc., which would
            <lb />
            distinguish the goods of the defendant from
            <lb />
            those of the plaintiff and belie the possibility of
            <lb />
            confusion or deception.&quot;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            53. In Satyam Infoway Ltd. vs. Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd., (2004) 6 SCC
            <lb />
            145, the Supreme Court observed that action of passing off is based on the
            <lb />
            goodwill and reputation that a trader has in the trademark or trade name and
            <lb />
            the remedy for an action for passing off is to preserve the goodwill and
            <lb />
            reputation of the Plaintiff as well as to safeguard the public against
            <lb />
            deception by believing the goods of one person to be those of another.

            <lb />
            1980 RPC 31, Lord Diplock stated the essential
            <lb />
            characteristics of a passing off action as under:
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            (1) misrepresentation, (2) made by a person in the
            <lb />
            course of trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or
            <lb />
            ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by
            <lb />
            him (4) which is calculated to injure the business or
            <lb />
            goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a
            <lb />
            reasonably foreseeable consequence and (5) which
            <lb />
            causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the
            <lb />
            trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia
            <lb />
            timet action) will probably do so.

            <lb />
            worth noting:

        <item>
            998. Essentials of the cause of action
            <lb />
            The plaintiff must prove that the disputed name, mark,
            <lb />
            sign or get up has become distinctive of his goods in
            <lb />
            the sense that by the use of his name or mark, etc. in
            <lb />
            relation to goods they are regarded, by a substantial
            <lb />
            number of members of the public or in the trade, as
            <lb />
            coming from a particular source, known or unknown;
            <lb />
            it is not necessary that the name of the plaintiff&apos;s firm
            <lb />
            should be known….. The plaintiff must further prove
            <lb />
            that the defendant&apos;s use of name or mark was likely or
            <lb />
            calculated to deceive, and thus cause confusion and
            <lb />
            injury, actual or probable, to the goodwill and the
            <lb />
            plaintiff&apos;s business, as for example, by depriving him
            <lb />
            of the profit that he might have had by selling the
            <lb />
            goods which ex hypothesi, the purchaser intended to
            <lb />
            buy. Thus, the cause of action involves a combination
            <lb />
            of distinctiveness of the plaintiff&apos;s name or mark and
            <lb />
            an injurious use by the defendant of the name or mark
            <lb />
            or a similar name or mark, sign, picture or get-up
            <lb />
            does or does not amount to passing off is in substance
            <lb />
            a question of evidence; the question whether the
            <lb />
            matter complained of is likely to deceive is a question
            <lb />
            for the Court.&quot;

            <lb />
            case of passing off has been very well discussed in the case of
            <lb />
            Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah, a judgment delivered
            <lb />
            by the Supreme Court, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 65, wherein
            <lb />
            the Apex Court while considering a plea of passing off and
            <lb />
            grant of ad interim injunction held that a person may sell his
            <lb />
            goods or deliver his services under a trading name or style
            <lb />
            which, with the passage of time, may acquire a reputation or
            <lb />
            goodwill and may become a property to be protected by the
            <lb />
            Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or
            <lb />
            services in the same name or by imitating that name causes
            <lb />
            injury to the business of one who has the property in that
            <lb />
            name. It was held that honesty and fair play are and ought to
            <lb />
            be the basic policy in the world of business and when a person
            <lb />
            adopts or intends to adopt a name which already belongs to
            <lb />
            someone else, it results in confusion, has the propensity of
            <lb />
            diverting the customers and clients of someone else to himself
            <lb />
            and thereby resulting in injury. It was held that the principles
            <lb />
            which apply to trade mark are applicable to trade name also.
            <lb />
            Relevant para 10 of the aforesaid judgment reads as under:-
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            &quot;The law does not permit any one to carry on his
            <lb />
            business in such a way as would persuade the customers
            <lb />
            or clients in believing that his goods or services
            <lb />
            belonging to someone else are his or are associated
            <lb />
            therewith. It does not matter whether the latter person
            <lb />
            does so fraudulently or otherwise. The reasons are two.
            <lb />
            Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, the
            <lb />
            basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when a
            <lb />
            person adopts or intends to adopt a name in connection
            <lb />
            with his business or services which already belongs to
            <lb />
            someone else it results in confusion and has propensity
            <lb />
            of diverting the customers and clients of someone else to
            <lb />
            himself and thereby resulting in injury.&quot;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            In this case, the Apex Court further observed that:
            <lb />
            &quot;Where there is probability of confusion in business, an
            <lb />
            injunction will be granted even though the defendants
            <lb />
            adopted the name innocently.&quot;&quot;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            56. From a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments and the principles
            <lb />
            propounded therein, it emerges that an action for passing off is brought by a
            <lb />
            Plaintiff to restrain the Defendant from passing off its goods and/or services
            <lb />
            to the public and is inherently aimed not only to protect and preserve the
            <lb />
            reputation of the Plaintiff but also to safeguard the public interest. The
            <lb />
            action is based on the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff albeit it is not
            <lb />
            essential for the Plaintiff to prove a long user to establish reputation and it
            <lb />
            would depend upon the volume of sales and extent of advertisement in a
            <lb />
            given case. The pre-requisite of making a claim alleging passing off is that
            <lb />
            the Defendant must have sold its goods or offered its services in a manner
            <lb />
            which has deceived or is likely to deceive the public into believing that the
            <lb />
            goods or services are that of the Plaintiff. Passing off is a common law
            <lb />
            remedy and does not require registration of the trademark of the Plaintiff.
            <lb />
            Passing off is &apos;goods&apos; specific as contrasted with infringement, which is
            <lb />
            &apos;mark&apos; specific. Thus, the sine qua non of passing off action is
            <lb />
            &quot;misrepresentation&quot; by the Defendant to the public, in the course of trade,
            <lb />
            which does not necessarily mean fraud or mala fide intent and can just be an
            <lb />
            innocent misrepresentation. Injury to reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff
            <lb />
            is the second essential element and loss or likelihood of loss is the third
            <lb />
            ingredient in an action of passing off.
            <lb />

        <p>
            57. Winfield and Jolowicz in their book on Tort (13 th Edition) have
            <lb />
            explained the concept of passing off as follows:
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;Although the classic form of the tort is one trader
            <lb />
            representing his goods as those of someone else, the basis of
            <lb />
            the liability is wider; it is the injury to the plaintiff&apos;s business
            <lb />
            goodwill the benefit and advantage of the good name,
            <lb />
            reputation and connection of a business…the attractive force
            <lb />
            which brings in customers.&quot;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            58. The essential characteristics/elements of the action of passing off have
            <lb />
            been brought out in Erven Warnink BV vs. J. Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd.,
            <lb />
            [1979] 2 All ER 927 and it would be apposite to refer to them as under:
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;(1) a misrepresentation, (2) made by a trader in the course of
            <lb />
            trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate
            <lb />
            consumers of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is
            <lb />
            calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader
            <lb />
            (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable
            <lb />
            consequence), and (5) which causes actual damage to a
            <lb />
            business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is
            <lb />
            brought or in a quiatimet action will probably do so&quot;
            <lb />
        </item>

        <p>
            59. From the averments in the plaint and the documents placed on record
            <lb />
            by the Plaintiffs such as the Chartered Accountant certified sales figures as
            <lb />
            well as sales invoices, which are not refuted, Plaintiffs have proved that the
            <lb />
            word marks &quot;ISITE&quot;, &quot;NEW I-SITE&quot; and &quot;I-SITE PLUS&quot; have been
            <lb />
            adopted and extensively and commercially used in relation to the health
            <lb />
            supplements. Plaintiffs, by their sale figures, media articles and reports,
            <lb />
            advertisements and trade literature have established that in the course of
            <lb />
            trade, the word marks have acquired distinctiveness and formidable
            <lb />
            goodwill and reputation as a badge of quality products originating from the
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs. Newspaper reports and articles reflect immense goodwill and
            <lb />
            reputation. Sales figures and expenses incurred on promotion are indicators
            <lb />
            of the reputation which the Plaintiffs enjoy.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            60. From the documents placed on record by the Plaintiffs, which include
            <lb />
            screenshots from the interactive websites of the Defendants as well as the
            <lb />
            e-pharmacy namely &apos;Mednear&apos;, it is evident that Defendants have adopted
            <lb />
            and are using the trademarks of the Plaintiffs with respect to health
            <lb />
            supplements and it is clear that the intention is to ride over the Plaintiffs&apos;
            <lb />
            reputation and goodwill. Plaintiffs have furnished a comparative table in the
            <lb />
            plaint, drawing similarity between the product of the Plaintiffs and the
            <lb />
            Defendants and relevant it is to note that both products are OTC drugs at a
            <lb />
            comparable price range, with the chemical composition almost overlapping.
            <lb />
            The identity of products, visual similarity and phonetic identity of the
            <lb />
            trademark is likely to create confusion and may lead to an unwary purchaser
            <lb />
            with imperfect recollection to purchase the supplements of the Defendants
            <lb />
            under an impression that they are sourced from the Plaintiffs, with resultant
            <lb />
            injury to the public and consequential revenue loss to the Plaintiffs. As
            <lb />
            aforementioned, the word &quot;ISITE&quot; was coined by the Plaintiffs in 1997 and
            <lb />
            is written differently from the commonly known spellings of the English
            <lb />
            word &quot;EYESIGHT&quot; and the adoption by the Defendants of part of the mark
            <lb />
            in an identical fashion clearly shows the intent to misrepresent and pass off
            <lb />
            the goods as that of the Plaintiffs by riding on their goodwill and reputation.
            <lb />
            The dishonest adoption by the Defendants leads to an inevitable conclusion
            <lb />
            that the Defendants are guilty of having committed the tort of passing off.
            <lb />
            This would not only lead to loss of reputation but also loss of revenue for the
            <lb />
            Plaintiffs. Defendants have consciously decided to keep away from the
            <lb />
            proceedings and, therefore, there is no plausible explanation as to why the
            <lb />
            Defendants adopted the marks visually deceptively similar and phonetically
            <lb />
            identical for the same products.
            <lb />
        </p>

        <p>
            61. It is pertinent to note that the products involved in the present case are
            <lb />
            health supplements and OTC drugs, which can be purchased without
            <lb />
            prescription of a medical practitioner. Hence, the products are primarily
            <lb />
            purchased by consumers who would more often than not make informed
            <lb />
            decisions on their own. Based upon market research, brand recollection and
            <lb />
            the quality maintained by the product, the consumer makes a choice
            <lb />
            amongst similar products in the market and, therefore, the trademark
            <lb />
            acquires grave significance. Courts have repeatedly affirmed that a lower
            <lb />
            threshold for determining confusion would apply in case of OTC medicinal
            <lb />
            products, since a lay consumer, lacking knowledge or skill in the field of
            <lb />
            medicine, would be unable to offset the doubtful impression created while
            <lb />
            purchasing the products with identical or deceptively similar or similar
            <lb />
            trademarks. Applying the principles to the present case, a consumer,
            <lb />
            intending to purchase the health supplement would be prone to confusion on
            <lb />
            account of the phonetic identity in the competing marks of the Plaintiffs and
            <lb />
            the Defendants as the product is an OTC and is sold without prescription. It
            <lb />
            would be useful in this regard to refer to a passage from the judgment of the
            <lb />
            Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care (supra):-
            <lb />
        </p>

        <item>
            &quot;32. Public interest would support lesser degree of proof
            <lb />
            showing confusing similarity in the case of trade mark in
            <lb />
            respect of medicinal products as against other non-medicinal
            <lb />
            products. Drugs are poisons, not sweets. Confusion between
            <lb />
            medicinal products may, therefore, be life threatening, not
            <lb />
            merely inconvenient. Noting the frailty of human nature and
            <lb />
            the pressures placed by society on doctors, there should be as
            <lb />
            many clear indicators as possible to distinguish two medicinal
            <lb />
            products from each other. It is not uncommon that in hospitals,
            <lb />
            drugs can be requested verbally and/or under critical/pressure
            <lb />
            situations. Many patients may be elderly, infirm or illiterate.
            <lb />
            They may not be in a position to differentiate between the
            <lb />
            medicine prescribed and bought which is ultimately handed
            <lb />
            over to them. This view finds support from McCarthy on Trade
            <lb />
            Marks, 3rd Edn., para 23.12 of which reads as under:
            <lb />
        </item>

        <item>
            &quot;The tests of confusing similarity are modified when the
            <lb />
            goods involved are medicinal products. Confusion of
            <lb />
            source or product between medicinal products may
            <lb />
            produce physically harmful results to purchasers and
            <lb />
            greater protection is required than in the ordinary case.
            <lb />
            If the goods involved are medicinal products each with
            <lb />
            different effects and designed for even subtly different
            <lb />
            uses, confusion among the products caused by similar
            <lb />
            marks could have disastrous effects. For these reasons,
            <lb />
            it is proper to require a lesser quantum of proof of
            <lb />
            confusing similarity for drugs and medicinal
            <lb />
            preparations. The same standard has been applied to
            <lb />
            medical products such as surgical sutures and clavicle
            <lb />
            splints.&quot;

        </item>

            33. …...However, the appellants are right in contending that
            <lb />
            where medicinal products are involved, the test to be applied
            <lb />
            for adjudging the violation of trade mark law may not be on a
            <lb />
            par with cases involving non-medicinal products. A stricter
            <lb />
            approach should be adopted while applying the test to judge
            <lb />
            the possibility of confusion of one medicinal product for
            <lb />
            another by the consumer. While confusion in the case of non-
            <lb />
            medicinal products may only cause economic loss to the
            <lb />
            plaintiff, confusion between the two medicinal products may
            <lb />
            have disastrous effects on health and in some cases life itself.
            <lb />
            Stringent measures should be adopted specially where
            <lb />
            medicines are the medicines of last resort as any confusion in
            <lb />
            such medicines may be fatal or could have disastrous effects.
            <lb />
            The confusion as to the identity of the product itself could have
            <lb />
            dire effects on the public health.&quot;
