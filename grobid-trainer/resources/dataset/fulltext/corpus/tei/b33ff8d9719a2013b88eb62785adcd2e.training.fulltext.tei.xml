			Lis in the Appeals
		</head>
		<lb />
		<p>
			1.1
			<lb />
			Tata Sons (Private) Limited has come up with two appeals
			<lb />
			in Civil Appeal Nos.1314 of 2020, challenging a final order dated
			<lb />
			18-12-2019 passed by the National Company Law Appellate
			<lb />
			Tribunal (&quot;NCLAT&quot; for short) (i) holding as illegal, the proceedings of
			<lb />
			the sixth meeting of the Board of Directors of TATA Sons Limited
			<lb />
			held on 24.10.2016 in so far as it relates to the removal of Shri
			<lb />
			Cyrus Pallonji Mistry (&quot;CPM&quot; for short); (ii) restoring the position of
			<lb />
			CPM as the Executive Chairman of Tata Sons Limited and
			<lb />
			consequently as a Director of the Tata Companies for the rest of the
			<lb />
			tenure; (iii) declaring as illegal the appointment of someone else in
			<lb />
			the place of CPM as Executive Chairman; (iv) restraining Shri Ratan
			<lb />
			N. Tata (&quot;RNT&quot; for short) and the nominees of Tata Trust from
			<lb />
			taking any decision in advance; (v) restraining the Company, its
			<lb />
			Board of Directors and Shareholders from exercising the power
			<lb />
			under Article 75 of the Articles of Association against the minority
			<lb />
			members except in exceptional circumstances and in the interest of
			<lb />
			the Company; and (vi) declaring as illegal, the decision of the
			<lb />
			Registrar of Companies for changing the status of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			Limited from being a public company into a private company.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			1.2
			<lb />
			RNT has come up with two independent appeals in Civil
			<lb />
			Appeal Nos.1920 of 2020 against the same Order of the NCLAT, on
			<lb />
			similar grounds.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			1.3
			<lb />
			The trustees of two Trusts namely Sir Ratan Tata Trust
			<lb />
			and Sir Dorabji Tata Trust have come up with two independent
			<lb />
			appeals in Civil Appeal Nos.444445 of 2020, challenging the
			<lb />
			impugned order of the Appellate Tribunal. A few companies of the
			<lb />
			Tata Group, which were referred to in the course of arguments, as
			<lb />
			the operating companies or downstream companies, such as the
			<lb />
			Tata Consultancy Services Limited, the Tata Teleservices Limited
			<lb />
			and Tata Industries Limited have come up with separate appeals in
			<lb />
			Civil Appeal Nos.440441 of 2020, 442443 of 2020 and 448449 of
			<lb />
			2020. The grievance of RNT as well as the Trustees of the two
			<lb />
			Trusts, is as regards the injunctive order of the Appellate Tribunal
			<lb />
			restraining them from taking any decision. The grievance of the
			<lb />
			three operating companies which have filed 6 Civil Appeals is that
			<lb />
			CPM has been directed to be reinstated as Director of these
			<lb />
			companies by the impugned Order, for the rest of the tenure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1.4
			<lb />
			The original complainants before the National Company
			<lb />
			Law Tribunal (&quot;NCLT&quot;for short), who initiated the proceedings under
			<lb />
			Sections 241 and 242 of the Companies Act, 2013 namely (i) Cyrus
			<lb />
			Investments Private Limited (ii) Sterling Investment Corporation
			<lb />
			Private Limited, have come up with a cross appeal in Civil Appeal
			<lb />
			No.1802 of 2020. Their grievance is that in addition to the reliefs
			<lb />
			already granted, the NCLAT ought to have also granted a direction
			<lb />
			to provide them proportionate representation on the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors of Tata Sons Limited and in all Committees formed by the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors. They have one more grievance namely that the
			<lb />
			Appellate Tribunal ought to have deleted the requirement of an
			<lb />
			affirmative Vote in the hands of select Directors under Article 121
			<lb />
			or at least ought to have restricted the affirmative vote to matters
			<lb />
			covered by Article 121A.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			1.5
			<lb />
			In addition to C.A.Nos. 13 and 14 of 2020, Tata Sons
			<lb />
			have also come up with 2 more appeals in C.A.Nos. 263 and 264 of
			<lb />
			2020. These appeals arise out of an order passed by NCLAT on 06
			<lb />
			012020 in two interlocutory applications filed by the Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies, Mumbai, seeking amendment of the final order passed
			<lb />
			by NCLAT in the main appeals. The reason why the Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies was constrained to file 2 interlocutory applications in
			<lb />
			the disposed of appeals, was that in the final order passed on 18
			<lb />
			122019 by NCLAT in the 2 company appeals, there were some
			<lb />
			remarks against the Registrar of Companies for having issued an
			<lb />
			amended certificate of incorporation to Tata Sons by striking off the
			<lb />
			word &quot;Public&quot; and inserting the word &quot;Private&quot;. NCLAT dismissed
			<lb />
			these 2 applications by an order dated 06012020, not merely
			<lb />
			holding that there were no adverse remarks against the Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies but also giving additional reasons to justify its findings
			<lb />
			in the disposed of appeals, in the purported exercise of the power
			<lb />
			available under section 420 of the Companies Act, 2013. Therefore,
			<lb />
			Tata Sons have come up with these 2 appeals in C.A.Nos. 263 and
			<lb />
			264 of 2020.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1.6
			<lb />
			Thus we have on hand, 15 Civil Appeals, 14 of which are
			<lb />
			on one side, assailing the Order of NCLAT in entirety. The
			<lb />
			remaining appeal is filed by the opposite group, seeking more reliefs
			<lb />
			than what had been granted by the Tribunal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1.7
			<lb />
			For the purpose of easy appreciation, we shall refer to the
			<lb />
			appellants in the set of 14 Civil Appeals as &quot;the Tata Group&quot; or &quot;the
			<lb />
			Appellants&quot;. We shall refer to the other group as &quot;SP Group&quot;
			<lb />
			(Shapoorji Pallonji Group) or &quot;the respondents&quot;. Similarly we shall
			<lb />
			refer to Tata Sons Limited (or Tata Sons Private Limited) merely as
			<lb />
			&apos;Tata Sons&apos;, as there is a controversy regarding the usage of the
			<lb />
			word &quot;Private&quot; before the word &quot;Limited&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			2. Background of the Litigation
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			2.1
			<lb />
			On 08.11.1917, Tata Sons was incorporated as a Private
			<lb />
			Limited Company under the Companies Act, 1913.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.2
			<lb />
			Two companies by name Cyrus Investments Private
			<lb />
			Limited and Sterling Investment Corporation Private Limited,
			<lb />
			forming part of the SP Group respectively acquired 48 preference
			<lb />
			shares and 40 equity shares of the paidup share capital of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons, from an existing member by name Mrs. Rodabeh Sawhney.
			<lb />
			Over the years, the shareholding of SP Group in Tata Sons has
			<lb />
			grown to 18.37% of the total paidup share capital.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.3
			<lb />
			The shareholding pattern of Tata Sons Limited is as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<table>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Shares held by two Tata Trusts
			<lb />
			65.89%
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Shares held by SP Group
			<lb />
			18.37%
			<lb />
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Shares held by operating Companies
			<lb />
			12.87%
			<lb />
			Total
			<lb />
			97.13%
		</table>
		<lb />
		<p>The balance is held by RNT and a few others.</p>
		<lb />

		<p>
			2.4
			<lb />
			From 25.06.1980 to 15.12.2004 Shri Pallonji S. Mistry,
			<lb />
			the father of CPM was a NonExecutive Director on the Board of
			<lb />
			Tata Sons. On 10.08.2006 CPM was appointed as a NonExecutive
			<lb />
			Director on the Board.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.5
			<lb />
			By a Resolution of the Board of Directors of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			dated 16.03.2012, CPM was appointed as Executive Deputy
			<lb />
			Chairman for a period of five years from 01.04.2012 to 31.03.2017,
			<lb />
			subject however to the approval of the shareholders at a General
			<lb />
			Meeting. The General Meeting gave its approval on 01.08.2012.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.6
			<lb />
			By a Resolution dated 18.12.2012, the Board of Directors
			<lb />
			of Tata Sons redesignated CPM as its Executive Chairman with
			<lb />
			effect from 29.12.2012, even while designating RNT as Chairman
			<lb />
			Emeritus.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.7
			<lb />
			By a Resolution passed on 24.10.2016, the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors of Tata Sons replaced CPM with RNT as the interim Non
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman. It is relevant to note that CPM was replaced
			<lb />
			only from the post of Executive Chairman and it was left to his
			<lb />
			choice to continue or not, as NonExecutive Director of Tata Sons.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.8
			<lb />
			As a follow up, certain things happened and by separate
			<lb />
			Resolutions passed at the meetings of the shareholders of Tata
			<lb />
			Industries Limited, Tata Consultancy Services Limited and Tata
			<lb />
			Teleservices Limited, CPM was removed from Directorship of those
			<lb />
			companies. CPM then resigned from the Directorship of a few other
			<lb />
			operating companies such as the Indian Hotels Company Limited,
			<lb />
			Tata Steel Limited, Tata Motors Limited, Tata Chemicals Limited
			<lb />
			and Tata Power Company Limited, after coming to know of the
			<lb />
			impending resolutions to remove him from Directorship.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.9
			<lb />
			Thereafter, 2 companies by name, Cyrus Investments
			<lb />
			Private Limited and Sterling Investment Corporation Private
			<lb />
			Limited, belonging to the SP Group, in which CPM holds a
			<lb />
			controlling interest, filed a company petition in C.P No.82 of 2016
			<lb />
			before the National Company Law Tribunal under Sections 241 and
			<lb />
			242 read with 244 of the Companies Act, 2013, on the grounds of
			<lb />
			unfair prejudice, oppression and mismanagement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.10
			<lb />
			But these two companies, hereinafter referred to as &apos;the
			<lb />
			complainantcompanies&apos;, together had only around 2% of the total
			<lb />
			issued share capital of Tata Sons. This is far below the deminimus
			<lb />
			qualification prescribed under Section 244(1)(a) to invoke sections
			<lb />
			241 and 242. Therefore, the complainant companies filed a
			<lb />
			miscellaneous application under the proviso to Subsection (1) of
			<lb />
			Section 244 seeking waiver of the requirement of Section 244(1)(a),
			<lb />
			which requires atleast one hundred members of the company
			<lb />
			having a share capital or onetenth of the total number of fixed
			<lb />
			members or any member or members holding not less than one
			<lb />
			tenth of the issued share capital of the company alone to be entitled
			<lb />
			to be the applicant/applicants.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.11
			<lb />
			Along with the application for waiver of the requirement
			<lb />
			of Section 244(1)(a), the complainant companies also moved an
			<lb />
			application for stay of an Extraordinary General Meeting (&quot;EGM&quot;
			<lb />
			for short) of Tata Sons, in which a proposal for removing CPM as a
			<lb />
			Director of Tata Sons had been moved. The NCLT refused stay, as a
			<lb />
			consequence of which the EGM proceeded as scheduled and CPM
			<lb />
			was removed from the Directorship of Tata Sons, by a Resolution
			<lb />
			dated 16.02.2017.
			<lb />
			2.12
			<lb />
			Subsequently, by an Order dated 06.03.2017, NCLT held
			<lb />
			the main company petition to be not maintainable at the instance of
			<lb />
			persons holding just around 2% of the issued share capital. This
			<lb />
			was followed by another order dated 17.4.2017, by which NCLT
			<lb />
			dismissed the application for waiver.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.13
			<lb />
			The complainant companies filed appeals before NCLAT
			<lb />
			against both the Orders dated 06.03.2017 and 17.04.2017. These
			<lb />
			appeals were allowed on 21.09.2017, granting waiver of the
			<lb />
			requirement of Section 244(1)(a) and remanding the matter back to
			<lb />
			NCLT for disposal on merits. Tata Group did not challenge this
			<lb />
			order.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.14
			<lb />
			Thereafter, NCLT heard the company petition on merits
			<lb />
			and dismissed the same by an Order dated 09.07.2018.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.15
			<lb />
			Challenging the order of the NCLT, the two complainant
			<lb />
			companies filed one appeal. CPM filed another appeal. Both these
			<lb />
			appeals were allowed by the Appellate Tribunal by a final Order
			<lb />
			dated 18.12.2019 granting the following reliefs:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The proceedings of the sixth meeting of the Board of Directors
			<lb />
			of &apos;Tata Sons
			<lb />
			Limited&apos; held on Monday, 24 th October,
			<lb />
			2016 so far as it relates to removal and
			<lb />
			other
			<lb />
			actions
			<lb />
			taken against Mr. Cyrus Pallonji Mistry (11 th Respondent) is
			<lb />
			declared illegal and is set aside. In the result, Mr. Cyrus
			<lb />
			Pallonji Mistry (11 th Respondent) is restored to his original
			<lb />
			position as Executive Chairman of &apos;Tata Sons Limited&apos; and
			<lb />
			consequently as Director of the &apos;Tata Companies&apos; for rest of
			<lb />
			the tenure.
			<lb />
			As a sequel thereto, the person who has been appointed as
			<lb />
			&apos;Executive Chairman&apos; in place of Mr. Cyrus Pallonji Mistry
			<lb />
			(11 th Respondent), his consequential appointment is declared
			<lb />
			illegal.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Mr. Ratan N. Tata (2 nd Respondent) and the nominee of the
			<lb />
			&apos;Tata Trusts&apos; shall desist from taking any decision in advance
			<lb />
			which requires majority decision of the Board of Directors or
			<lb />
			in the Annual General Meeting.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			In view of &apos;prejudicial&apos; and &apos;oppressive&apos; decision taken during
			<lb />
			last few years, the Company, its Board of Directors and
			<lb />
			shareholders which has not exercised its power under Article
			<lb />
			75 since inception, will not exercise its power under Article 75
			<lb />
			against Appellants and other minority member. Such power
			<lb />
			can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and in
			<lb />
			the interest of the company, but before exercising such power,
			<lb />
			reasons should be recorded in writing and intimated to the
			<lb />
			concerned shareholders whose right will be affected.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			The decision of the Registrar of Companies changing the
			<lb />
			Company (&apos;Tata Sons Limited&apos;) from &apos;Public Company&apos; to
			<lb />
			&apos;Private Company&apos; is declared illegal and set aside. The
			<lb />
			Company (&apos;Tata Sons Limited&apos;) shall be recorded as &apos;Public
			<lb />
			Company&apos;. The &apos;Registrar of Companies&apos; will make correction
			<lb />
			in its record showing the Company (&apos;Tata Sons Limited&apos;) as
			<lb />
			&apos;Public Company&apos;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			2.16
			<lb />
			After NCLAT disposed of the appeals by its order dated
			<lb />
			18122019, the Registrar of Companies moved 2 interlocutory
			<lb />
			applications seeking the deletion of certain remarks made by
			<lb />
			NCLAT against them. These applications were dismissed by NCLAT
			<lb />
			by order dated 06012020. Therefore, as against the final Order of
			<lb />
			NCLAT dated 18122019, (i) Tata Sons Private Limited (ii) RNT (iii)
			<lb />
			the Trustees of the two Tata Trusts and (iv) three operating
			<lb />
			companies of Tata Group have come up with 2 Civil Appeals each
			<lb />
			(totalling to 12 appeals) and the complainant companies have come
			<lb />
			up with one Civil Appeal. In addition, Tata Sons have also come up
			<lb />
			with 2 more appeals against the order dated 06012020 passed by
			<lb />
			NCLAT on the applications of the Registrar of Companies.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			3.
			<lb />
			Case set up by the complainants in their petition under
			<lb />
			sections 241 and 242, Companies Act, 2013 and Reliefs sought
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			3.1
			<lb />
			In the company petition as it was originally filed by S.P.
			<lb />
			Group in December, 2016 before the NCLT, the complainant
			<lb />
			companies claimed that the affairs of Tata Sons, are carried out as
			<lb />
			though it was a proprietary concern of RNT and that the oppressive
			<lb />
			conduct of the respondents was such that it would be just and
			<lb />
			equitable to wind up Tata Sons, but such winding up would
			<lb />
			unfairly prejudice the interest of the petitioners and that therefore
			<lb />
			the Tribunal should pass such orders so as to bring to an end, the
			<lb />
			acts of oppression and mismanagement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.2
			<lb />
			The acts of oppression and mismanagement complained
			<lb />
			against Tata Sons revolved around (i) alleged abuse of the Articles
			<lb />
			of Association, particularly Articles 121, 121A, 86, 104B and 118,
			<lb />
			to enable the trusts and its nominee Directors to exercise control
			<lb />
			over the Board of Directors; (ii) alleged illegal removal of CPM as
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman without any notice and an all out attempt to
			<lb />
			remove him from the Directorship of all the operating companies of
			<lb />
			the Tata group; (iii) alleged dubious transactions in relation to Tata
			<lb />
			Teleservices Limited, alongwith one Mr. C. Sivasankaran; (iv) RNT
			<lb />
			allegedly treating Tata Sons as a proprietorship concern with all
			<lb />
			others acting as puppets, resulting in the Board of Directors failing
			<lb />
			the test of fairness and probity (v) acquisition of Corus Group PLC
			<lb />
			of UK at an inflated price and then jeopardising the talks for its
			<lb />
			merger with Thyssen Krupp (vi) Nano car project becoming a
			<lb />
			disaster with losses accumulating year after year and the conflict of
			<lb />
			interest that RNT had in the supply of Nano gliders to a company
			<lb />
			where he had stakes; (vii) providing corporate guarantee to IL &amp; FS
			<lb />
			Trust Company for the loan sanctioned by Standard Chartered
			<lb />
			Bank to Sterling (viii) making Kalimati Investments Ltd, a
			<lb />
			subsidiary of Tata Steel to provide an inter corporate bridge loan to
			<lb />
			Sterling; (ix) the dealings with NTT DoCoMo and Sterling resulting
			<lb />
			in an arbitration award for a staggering amount; (x) leaking
			<lb />
			information to Siva of Sterling that resulted in Siva issuing legal
			<lb />
			notices to Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons (xi) RNT making a
			<lb />
			personal gain for himself through the sale of a flat owned by a Tata
			<lb />
			group company to Mehli Mistry; (xii) companies controlled by Mehli
			<lb />
			Mistry receiving favours due to the personal relationship that RNT
			<lb />
			had with him; and (xiii) fraudulent transactions in the deal with Air
			<lb />
			Asia which led to financing of terrorism.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.3
			<lb />
			On the foundation of the above, the complainant
			<lb />
			companies contended before NCLT: (i) that the directors of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons are not carrying out their fiduciary responsibilities for and on
			<lb />
			behalf of the shareholders, but have become mere puppets
			<lb />
			controlled by RNT and the Trustees of the two Trusts; (ii) that the
			<lb />
			powers contained in the Articles of Association are being exercised
			<lb />
			in a malafide manner prejudicial to the interest of the petitioners
			<lb />
			and to public interest; (iii) that various operating decisions are
			<lb />
			taken either for emotional reasons or for pampering the ego of RNT;
			<lb />
			(iv) that attempts are made to shield persons responsible for
			<lb />
			fraudulent transactions at Air Asia; (v) that attempts are made to
			<lb />
			ensure that no legal action is initiated against Siva who owes Rs.
			<lb />
			694 crores; (vi) that Ratan Tata enabled his associates to unjustly
			<lb />
			enrich themselves at the cost of Tata Sons; and (vii) that the
			<lb />
			present directors of Tata Sons are not promoting the interests of
			<lb />
			shareholders of Tata Sons and the interests of the shareholders of
			<lb />
			various operating companies of the Tata group.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.4
			<lb />
			In the light of the above pleadings and contentions, the
			<lb />
			petitioners before the NCLT sought a set of about 21 reliefs, whose
			<lb />
			abridged version is as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			4. Amendment of pleadings, addition and deletion of reliefs
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			4.1
			<lb />
			The contents of Chapter3 above, are the pleadings made
			<lb />
			and the reliefs sought in the company petition, as it was originally
			<lb />
			filed on 20.12.2016. But the pleadings and the prayers underwent
			<lb />
			certain changes in the course of the proceedings, partly due to
			<lb />
			subsequent developments and partly due to change of
			<lb />
			strategy/better counsel.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.2
			<lb />
			What is important to note here is that some of the
			<lb />
			changes to the pleadings and the reliefs sought, were by way of
			<lb />
			proper applications for amendment and some others were just by
			<lb />
			way of additional affidavits. We shall advert to them in this part.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.3
			<lb />
			The company petition filed on 20.12.2016 was taken up
			<lb />
			on 22.12.2016 and the NCLT passed an order to the following
			<lb />
			effect:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;It has also been further agreed by all the parties more
			<lb />
			specially by the petitioner counsel, or R11 counsel and
			<lb />
			the counsel on behalf of the answering respondents
			<lb />
			that they will not file any interim application or initiate
			<lb />
			any action or proceedings over this subject matter
			<lb />
			pending disposal of this company petition.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			4.4
			<lb />
			Soon, the matter got precipitated. Claiming that CPM
			<lb />
			sent four boxfiles containing several documents relating to Tata
			<lb />
			Education Trust, to the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax with a
			<lb />
			view to create trouble, a special notice was issued for convening the
			<lb />
			EGM of Tata Sons on 06.02.2017 for considering the proposal for
			<lb />
			the removal of CPM as a Director of Tata Sons.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.5
			<lb />
			Therefore, the complainantcompanies moved a contempt
			<lb />
			application. The said application was disposed of by NCLT by an
			<lb />
			order dated 18.01.2017, permitting the complainantcompanies and
			<lb />
			CPM to file an additional affidavit limiting to the proposal for the
			<lb />
			removal of Cyrus Pallonji Mistry from the Board.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.6
			<lb />
			Accordingly, an additional affidavit was filed on
			<lb />
			21.01.2017. However, the NCLT, by an order dated 31.01.2017
			<lb />
			rejected the prayer of S.P. Group for stay of EGM scheduled to be
			<lb />
			held on 06.02.2017.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.7
			<lb />
			S.P. Group filed an appeal against the order refusing the
			<lb />
			stay of EGM. The appeal was disposed of on 03.02.2017, merely
			<lb />
			permitting the S.P. Group to file a petition for amendment, in the
			<lb />
			event of CPM being removed in the EGM. In the EGM held on
			<lb />
			06.02.2017, CPM was removed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.8
			<lb />
			Therefore,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			complainantcompanies
			<lb />
			filed
			<lb />
			an
			<lb />
			amendment application dated 10.02.2017 seeking addition of two
			<lb />
			more prayers namely: (i) to direct the respondents to reinstate the
			<lb />
			representative of the complainantcompanies on the Board of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons; and (ii) to direct the amendment of Articles of Association of
			<lb />
			Tata Sons to provide for proportional representation of shareholders
			<lb />
			on the Board of Directors of Tata Sons.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.9
			<lb />
			But the petition for contempt, the petition for interim
			<lb />
			stay of EGM and the application for amendment to include
			<lb />
			additional prayers, all turned out to be exercises in futility, with the
			<lb />
			NCLT passing two orders, one on 06.03.2017 and another on
			<lb />
			17.04.2017. By the first order dated 06.03.2017, NCLT held the
			<lb />
			company petition to be not maintainable, on the ground that the
			<lb />
			two complainant companies did not hold at least 10% of the issued
			<lb />
			share capital of Tata Sons. By the second order dated 17.04.2017,
			<lb />
			NCLT rejected the application for grant of waiver filed under the
			<lb />
			proviso to Subsection (1) of Section 244.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.10
			<lb />
			But the aforesaid orders of NCLT dated 06.03.2017 and
			<lb />
			17.04.2017 were reversed by NCLAT by an order dated 21.09.2017
			<lb />
			and the matter was remanded back to NCLT.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.11
			<lb />
			Thereafter, the complainantcompanies filed one
			<lb />
			additional affidavit, one application for amendment, one application
			<lb />
			for stay and one memo giving up some of the reliefs already sought.
			<lb />
			The facts relating to these, can be compressed into a tabular
			<lb />
			column as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<table>
			Sl.No.
			<lb />
			What was filed
			<lb />
			Reliefs sought
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			Additional affidavit dated
			<lb />
			31.10.2017
			<lb />
			This additional affidavit sought to
			<lb />
			challenge the conversion of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			from being a Public Limited Company
			<lb />
			into a Private Limited Company.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			Application for amendment
			<lb />
			dated 31.10.2017
			<lb />
			By this application, the complainants
			<lb />
			sought the following prayers:
			<lb />
			(M1):
			<lb />
			Set aside the resolution
			<lb />
			passed by the shareholders of
			<lb />
			respondent No.1 on September 21,
			<lb />

			Memorandum of Association of
			<lb />
			Respondent No.1 for conversion of

			Respondent No.1 into a private
			<lb />
			company.
			<lb />
			(M2):
			<lb />
			Strike off/Delete Article
			<lb />
			75 as the same is a tool in the hands
			<lb />
			of the majority shareholders to
			<lb />
			oppress the minority; and;
			<lb />
			(M3):
			<lb />
			Pending the final hearing
			<lb />
			disposal of the Company Petition, the
			<lb />
			effect and operation of the resolution
			<lb />
			dated September 21, 2017 be stayed.
			<lb />
			(F1):
			<lb />
			Direct Respondent No.1

			<lb />
			(G1):

			Board of Directors of Respondent
			<lb />
			No.1
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			Application for stay dated

			<lb />
			Response of Tata Sons to the allegations made in the
			<lb />
			Company Petition
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			5.1
			<lb />
			Tata Sons filed a reply to the company petition
			<lb />
			contending interalia : (i) that CPM, who was removed from the post
			<lb />
			of Executive Chairman, after having lost the confidence of 7 out of 9
			<lb />
			Directors, has sought to use the complainant companies to
			<lb />
			besmirch the reputation of Tata Group; (ii) that even the decisions
			<lb />
			to which CPM was a party have been questioned in the petition; (iii)
			<lb />
			that Tata Group founded in 1868 is a global enterprise,
			<lb />
			headquartered in India, comprising over a hundred operating
			<lb />
			companies, having presence in more than 100 countries across six
			<lb />
			continents, collectively employing over 6,60,000 people; (iv) that the
			<lb />
			revenue of Tata Group in 201516, was $103.51 billion; (v) that
			<lb />
			there are 29 publicly listed companies in the Tata Group with a
			<lb />
			combined market capitalisation of about $116.41 billion; (vi) that
			<lb />
			65.3% of the issued ordinary share capital of Tata Sons is held by
			<lb />
			philanthropic trusts which support education, health, livelihood
			<lb />
			generation and art and culture; (vii) that it was at the instance of
			<lb />
			CPM that RNT was designated as Chairman Emeritus and he was
			<lb />
			requested to attend Board Meetings as a special and permanent
			<lb />
			invitee and continue to guide the Board; (viii) that Articles 104B
			<lb />
			and 121 were introduced through a new version of Articles of
			<lb />
			Association at the Annual General Meeting of Tata Sons held on
			<lb />
			13.09.2000 and Article 121 was subsequently amended by
			<lb />
			Resolution dated 09.04.2014; (ix) that Shri Pallonji Shapoorji
			<lb />
			Mistry, who represented the complainant companies, was present
			<lb />
			at the General meeting held on 13.09.2000; (x) that CPM himself
			<lb />
			was a party to the Resolution passed by the shareholders on
			<lb />
			09.04.2014, introducing Articles 121A and 121B; (xi) that CPM&apos;s
			<lb />
			leadership gave rise to certain issues such as insufficient detail and
			<lb />
			discipline on capital allocation decisions, slow execution on
			<lb />
			identified problems, lack of specificity and follow through in
			<lb />
			strategic plan and business plan, failure to take meaningful steps to
			<lb />
			enter new growth businesses, weak top management team and
			<lb />
			reluctance to embrace the Articles of Association that spelt out the
			<lb />
			governance structure of the company and the rights of Tata Trusts;
			<lb />
			(xii) that there was a growing trust deficit between the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors of Tata Sons and CPM due to several reasons, such as the
			<lb />
			conflict of interest in the matter of award of contracts to S.P. Group
			<lb />
			of companies and his systematic and planned reduction of the
			<lb />
			representation of Tata Sons Directors on the Boards of other major
			<lb />
			Tata Companies; (xiii) that even when the Directors of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			resolved on 24.10.2016 to replace CPM as Executive Chairman, the
			<lb />
			Board agreed to his continuance as a Director of Tata Sons;
			<lb />
			(xiv) that however CPM addressed a vitriolic mail on 25.10.2016 to
			<lb />
			the Directors making false allegations; (xv) that though the mail
			<lb />
			was marked confidential, it was simultaneously leaked to the press;
			<lb />
			(xvi) that CPM also breached his fiduciary and contractual duties
			<lb />
			by disclosing confidential information and documents pertaining to
			<lb />
			Tata Sons to third parties; (xvii) that CPM made representations to
			<lb />
			the shareholders of all operating companies, with unsubstantiated
			<lb />
			and false allegations, thereby attempting to make the operating
			<lb />
			companies vulnerable to make confidential data available for public
			<lb />
			inspection; (xviii) that the shareholders of Tata Industries Limited,
			<lb />
			Tata Consultancy Services and Tata Teleservices Limited passed
			<lb />
			Resolutions respectively on 12.12.2016, 13.12.2016 and
			<lb />
			14.12.2016 to remove CPM from Directorship; (xix) that, therefore,
			<lb />
			CPM resigned from the Directorship of the other companies also on
			<lb />
			19.12.2016, when he faced the prospect of being removed in the
			<lb />
			impending meetings; (xx) that the actions and conduct of CPM after
			<lb />
			24.10.2016 compelled Tata Sons to issue a special notice and
			<lb />
			requisition for his removal from the Directorship of Tata Sons; (xxi)
			<lb />
			that the company petition was not about espousing the cause of
			<lb />
			corporate governance or seeking remedies for oppression and
			<lb />
			mismanagement of Tata Sons; (xxii) that prior to his removal as
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman, CPM never raised any concerns regarding any
			<lb />
			oppression or mismanagement; (xxiii) that many of the acts of
			<lb />
			oppression complained of by the complainant companies, have
			<lb />
			happened long before the date of filing of the company petition,
			<lb />
			showing thereby that the company petition was hopelessly barred
			<lb />
			by delay and laches.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.2
			<lb />
			On the allegations of oppression and mismanagement,
			<lb />
			the response of Tata Sons was as follows: (i) that the complainant
			<lb />
			companies have cherry picked certain business decisions to launch
			<lb />
			a vitriolic attack on the Tata Trusts; (ii) that while the complainant
			<lb />
			companies have talked about bad business deals, such as Corus
			<lb />
			acquisition and Nano Project, they have deliberately omitted to talk
			<lb />
			about Tetley acquisition by Tata Global Beverages Limited, the
			<lb />
			immensely successful Jaguar Land Rover acquisition by Tata
			<lb />
			Motors and the phenomenal success of Tata Consultancy Services;
			<lb />
			(iii) that Corus acquisition, the Nano Project, contracts awarded to
			<lb />
			the business concerns of Mr. Mehli Mistry and the investment by
			<lb />
			Mr.C. Sivasankaran have surfaced only after the replacement of Mr.
			<lb />
			Cyrus Mistry as the Executive Chairman; (iv) that CPM has been
			<lb />
			the Director of Tata Sons since the year 2006 and was also the
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman from December, 2012 to October, 2016 and
			<lb />
			was fully aware of how the decisions relating to these projects were
			<lb />
			taken when they were taken; (v) that courts cannot be called upon
			<lb />
			to sit in judgment over the commercial decisions of the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors of companies; and (vi)
			<lb />
			that even commercial mis
			<lb />
			judgments of the Board of Directors cannot be branded as instances
			<lb />
			of oppression and mismanagement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.3
			<lb />
			On specific acts of oppression and mismanagement,
			<lb />
			raised in the company petition, such as (i) over priced and bleeding
			<lb />
			acquisition of Corus PLC of UK; (ii) doomed Nano car project;
			<lb />
			(iii) loan advanced by Kalimati Investments to Siva; (iv) sale of the
			<lb />
			residential flat to Mehli Mistry; (v) unjust enrichment of Mehli
			<lb />
			Mistry and the companies controlled by him, due to the personal
			<lb />
			equation of RNT with him; (vi) aviation industry misadventures;
			<lb />
			and (vii) a huge loss due to purchase of shares of Tata Motors, the
			<lb />
			reply filed by Tata Sons contained an elaborate and graphic
			<lb />
			rebuttal. We shall take note of them later, while dealing with the
			<lb />
			question whether or not the allegations constitute the ingredients of
			<lb />
			sections 241 and 242 of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			6.
			<lb />
			The approach of NCLT
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			6.1
			<lb />
			The NCLT, in its order dated 9.7.2018, went into each of
			<lb />
			the allegations of oppression, mismanagement and prejudice and
			<lb />
			recorded categorical findings. In brief, these findings, allegation
			<lb />
			wise, were as follows:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			On the allegations revolving around Siva and Sterling group of
			<lb />
			companies
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Tata Teleservices shares were acquired in the year 2006
			<lb />
			with the approval of the Board and hence almost after 10
			<lb />
			years, it cannot be raised as an issue. It is also a fact that
			<lb />
			the very complainant companies had acquired same TTSL
			<lb />
			shares two months before, for Rs.15 per share.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The loan taken from Kalimati Investments was already paid
			<lb />
			back by Siva Group of Companies and the company was
			<lb />
			relieved of its undertaking by Siva himself who provided
			<lb />
			personal guarantee for the loan taken from Standard
			<lb />
			Chartered Bank.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) As to the allegation that Siva made a big profit by selling
			<lb />
			shares to NTT DoCoMo @ Rs.117 per share, it is evident
			<lb />
			from the record that these shares were sold in the year
			<lb />
			2008 to NTT DoCoMo, while NTT DoCoMo was acquiring
			<lb />
			shares in bulk from TTSL as well as from some of the
			<lb />
			shareholders of TTSL including the brother and father of
			<lb />
			CPM and also from Siva. They also equally gained benefit
			<lb />
			just as Siva group gained from selling shares of TTSL to NTT
			<lb />
			DoCoMo. But this was not disclosed by the complainant
			<lb />
			companies either in their petition or in their rejoinder. The
			<lb />
			rate at which the petitioners acquired shares of TTSL is less
			<lb />
			than the rate at which Siva Group acquired and the gain
			<lb />
			that the petitioners made by selling shares to NTT DoCoMo
			<lb />
			was more than the gain Siva group got from selling shares
			<lb />
			to NTT DoCoMo.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) No material has been placed either by the petitioner or by
			<lb />
			CPM to show that any information was leaked to Siva Group
			<lb />
			either by RNT or by anyone else.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) DoCoMo issue cropped up in 2016, when the award was
			<lb />
			passed for payment of Rs.8450 crores. The letter around
			<lb />
			which a controversy is raised, was written by RNT in the
			<lb />
			year 2013. Hence that letter cannot be linked to DoCoMo
			<lb />
			issue to show as if RNT was encouraging Mr. Siva not to pay
			<lb />
			money to the company.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			On the allegations relating to Air Asia</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Air Asia India Pvt. Ltd. is a joint venture between Air Asia
			<lb />
			Berhad (Malaysian Company) and Tata Sons, incorporated
			<lb />
			on 28.03.2013. The allegations relating to this, are mostly
			<lb />
			based on the emails sent by one Mr. Bharat Vasani, who is
			<lb />
			not a party to this proceeding and hence these allegations
			<lb />
			could not be put to test.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) In the meeting held on 06.12.2012, CPM did not raise any
			<lb />
			objection to the approval of the joint venture or for infusing
			<lb />
			funds in Air Asia India, until he was removed as Chairman
			<lb />
			of the company.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) In their desperate attempt to make a case out of nothing,
			<lb />
			the complainant companies claim on the one hand that
			<lb />
			CPM had no say in the Air Asia transaction, but on the
			<lb />
			other hand, they claim that CPM protected the interest of
			<lb />
			the company by limiting its exposure to 30% equity of USD
			<lb />
			30 million and by ensuring that no fall back liability came
			<lb />
			on the company.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) A person privy to a transaction is estopped from questioning
			<lb />
			it, but the complainant companies and CPM have made all
			<lb />
			kinds of allegations with impunity flouting all legal
			<lb />
			principles. They have proceeded as though they did not take
			<lb />
			active part in the Air Asia incorporation and as though CPM
			<lb />
			did not preside over the meeting on 15.09.2016 for further
			<lb />
			funding it. In addition, they have made a scurrilous
			<lb />
			statement, without a shred of paper, that RNT funded one
			<lb />
			Terrorist through hawala with diversion of Air Asia India
			<lb />
			funds.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			On the Transactions with Mehli Mistry, including the sale of the flat
			<lb />
			(Bhakthawar) and a land (Alibaug)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			There is nothing to indicate that RNT got enriched at the
			<lb />
			cost of the company. Forbes Golak was not made a Party
			<lb />
			and the transaction happened somewhere in the year 2002,
			<lb />
			but the allegation is raised in the year 2016.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			As to these allegations relating to Mehli deriving huge
			<lb />
			benefits, the only document that the Petitioners and CPM
			<lb />
			filed and relied on, is an email Mr. Mehli addressed to Mr.
			<lb />
			Padmanabhan of TPC among others.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) In respect of the 1993 contract for dredging at Trombay, it
			<lb />
			was awarded by Tata Power to MpCL for 9 years after
			<lb />
			choosing them from amongst three vendors. Thereafter it
			<lb />
			was renewed 5 times for various tenures from October 2002
			<lb />
			to September, 2014 after obtaining requisite approvals.
			<lb />
			When these approvals were given, CPM was a Director of
			<lb />
			Tata Power. He held directorship from 1996 to 2006 and
			<lb />
			again from 2011 to 2016, but never raised any objection.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			Nano car project and the losses suffered by Tata Motors
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			RNT has not been the director of Tata Motors at any point of
			<lb />
			time during which the actions complained of happened.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Tata Motors and Jayem incorporated a joint venture
			<lb />
			company by name J.T. Special Vehicle Pvt. Ltd. with 50:50
			<lb />
			shareholdings, in July 2016. This joint venture was
			<lb />
			incorporated under the stewardship of CPM himself. It is
			<lb />
			therefore entirely incorrect to say that Jayem has benefited
			<lb />
			unduly from any patronage extended by RNT.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Acquisition of Corus
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The acquisition of Corus was a collective decision of Tata
			<lb />
			Steel and it was approved by CPM as a director of the board
			<lb />
			of Tata Steel. This entire acquisition was undertaken
			<lb />
			following the due governance process under the supervision
			<lb />
			of the board of directors of Tata Steel without any dissent
			<lb />
			from any of the shareholders of Tata Steel.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Tata Steel did not buy it for an inflated price, but it so
			<lb />
			happened that Tata Steel took a unanimous decision to
			<lb />
			quote a price of GBP 608 pence per share while their
			<lb />
			competitor CSN&apos;s final bid was GBP 603 pence per share.
			<lb />
			CPM or the complainant companies have not placed any
			<lb />
			letter or email, seeking divesting or restructuring of Corus.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Private company vs Public company
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			On the impact of Section 43A (2A) of the Companies Act,
			<lb />
			1956 and the issue of the amended certificate of
			<lb />
			incorporation to Tata Sons, it has to be seen that Tata Sons
			<lb />
			had not altered any of the Articles of Association so as to
			<lb />
			bring any new entrenchment to the Articles and that the
			<lb />
			management had not done anything so as to cause
			<lb />
			prejudice to the rights of the minority shareholders.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			On the contention that a few Articles were oppressive or that they
			<lb />
			were abused
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The contention that Articles 104B, 121, 121A and 75 of the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association were per se oppressive and that they
			<lb />
			have been used as tools of oppression and mismanagement,
			<lb />
			is unacceptable since CPM&apos;s father was party to the
			<lb />
			amendments made to the Articles of Association on
			<lb />
			13.09.2000. The amendment of Article 118 was passed on
			<lb />
			06.
			12.2012 when CPM was the Executive Deputy
			<lb />
			Chairman. CPM was also party to the Resolutions passed
			<lb />
			on 09.04.2014, in which the Articles were amended so as to
			<lb />
			confer affirmative rights in favour of the Directors of the
			<lb />
			Trusts. In so far as Article 75 is concerned, it was in
			<lb />
			existence throughout and hence the question whether
			<lb />
			persons who acquired shares of such a company
			<lb />
			consciously despite the presence of Article 75, can turn
			<lb />
			around later and project them as oppressive, looms large.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ii) The fact that the nominee Directors stepped out of the
			<lb />
			meeting of the Board held on 29.06.2016 to take
			<lb />
			instructions from RNT on the issue of acquisition of
			<lb />
			Welspun by Tata power, cannot be projected as an incident
			<lb />
			where Article 121 was abused, since the issue of acquisition
			<lb />
			of Welspun should have come up before the Board of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons even prior to Tata Power taking a decision, in view of
			<lb />
			Article 121A(h). Since Tata Power had already signed the
			<lb />
			papers for the acquisition of Welspun on 12.06.2016 itself,
			<lb />
			CPM really made the Directors of Tata Sons as fait accompli.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it was the action of CPM that was prejudicial to
			<lb />
			the interests of Tata Sons and not the other way around.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(iii) None of the Articles have ever been opposed either by the
			<lb />
			complainant companies or by CPM at any point of time in
			<lb />
			the past. And Article 75 has been in place even before the
			<lb />
			complainant companies acquired shares.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Allegation of Breach of fiduciary duties by the Directors
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			In support of their allegation that there was breach of
			<lb />
			fiduciary duties by the Trust nominee Directors and to
			<lb />
			prove that the Directors of the Company were guilty of
			<lb />
			dereliction of duties in the teeth of Sections 149 and 166 of
			<lb />
			the Companies Act, 2013 read with schedule IV (Code for
			<lb />
			Independent Directors), the complainant companies had not
			<lb />
			placed any material other than the Minutes of the meeting
			<lb />
			held on 24.10.2016 (in which CPM was removed from
			<lb />
			Chairmanship). Also the removal of CPM as Executive
			<lb />
			Chairman was not in deprivation of any of the rights of the
			<lb />
			complainant companies as shareholders and his removal
			<lb />
			had nothing to do with his association with the complainant
			<lb />
			companies. The removal of CPM as Executive Chairman
			<lb />
			cannot be projected as oppression of minority shareholders
			<lb />
			merely because he also happens to have controlling interest
			<lb />
			in companies that hold around 18.40% shareholding in the
			<lb />
			company.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The provision in the Articles of Association entitling the two
			<lb />
			Trusts to have 1/3 rd of the Directors on the Board of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons with an affirmative vote, was actually a curtailment of
			<lb />
			their right to appoint majority of the Directors to the Board
			<lb />
			and hence it cannot be construed as oppressive of the
			<lb />
			minority.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			On the removal of CPM
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The removal of CPM as Executive Chairman of Tata Sons on
			<lb />
			24.10.2016 and his removal as Director on 06.02.2017,
			<lb />
			were on account of trust deficit and there was no question
			<lb />
			of a Selection Committee going into the issue of his removal.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) There was no material to hold that CPM was removed on
			<lb />
			account of purported legacy issues. CPM created a situation
			<lb />
			where he is not accountable either to the majority
			<lb />
			shareholders or to the Trust nominee Directors and hence
			<lb />
			his removal.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) The letter dated 25.10.2016 issued by CPM could not have
			<lb />
			been leaked to the media by anyone other than CPM and
			<lb />
			hence his removal from Directorship on 06.02.2017 became
			<lb />
			inevitable.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			6.2
			<lb />
			What we have provided in the preceding paragraph, is an
			<lb />
			abridged version of the findings recorded by NCLT on every one of
			<lb />
			the allegations contained in the main company petition. Apart from
			<lb />
			those findings recorded in the body of the judgment, NCLT itself
			<lb />
			gave a summary of findings in paragraph 581 of its decision. It is
			<lb />
			extracted verbatim as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;a) Removal of Mr. Cyrus Mistry as Executive Chairman on
			<lb />
			24.10.2016 is because the Board of Directors and Majority
			<lb />
			of Shareholders, i.e., Tata Trusts lost confidence in Mr.
			<lb />
			Cyrus as Chairman, not because by contemplating that
			<lb />
			Mr. Cyrus would cause discomfort to Mr. Tata, Mr.
			<lb />
			Soonawala and other answering Respondents over
			<lb />
			purported legacy issues. Board of Directors are competent
			<lb />
			to remove Executive Chairman; no selection committee
			<lb />
			recommendation is required before removing him as
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			b)
			<lb />
			Removal of Mr. Cyrus Mistry from the position of Director
			<lb />
			is because he admittedly sent the company information to
			<lb />
			Income Tax Authorities; leaked the company information to
			<lb />
			Media and openly come out against the Board and the
			<lb />
			Trusts, which hardly augurs well for smooth functioning of
			<lb />
			the company, and we have not found any merit to believe
			<lb />
			that his removal as director falls within the ambit of
			<lb />
			section 241 of Companies Act 2013.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			c)
			<lb />
			We have not found any merit to hold that proportional
			<lb />
			representation on Board proportionate to the shareholding
			<lb />
			of the petitioners is possible so long as Articles do not
			<lb />
			have such mandate as envisaged under section 163 of
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 2013.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			d)
			<lb />
			We have not found any merit in purported legacy issues,
			<lb />
			such as Siva issue, TTSL issue, Nano car issue, Corus
			<lb />
			issue, Mr. Mehli issue and Air Asia issue to state that
			<lb />
			those issues fall within the ambit of section 247 and 242
			<lb />
			of Companies Act 2013.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			e)
			<lb />
			We also have not found any merit to say that the company
			<lb />
			filing application under section 14 of Companies Act 2013
			<lb />
			asking this Tribunal to make it from Public to Private falls
			<lb />
			for consideration under the jurisdiction of section 247 &amp;
			<lb />
			242 of Companies Act 2013.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			f) We have also found no merit in saying that Mr. Tata &amp; Mr.
			<lb />
			Soonawala giving advices and suggestions amounted to
			<lb />
			interference in administering the affairs of the company, so
			<lb />
			that to consider their conduct as prejudicial to the interest
			<lb />
			of the company under section 241 of Companies Act 2013.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			g) We have found no merit in the argument that Mr. Tata and
			<lb />
			Mr. Soonawala acted as shadow directors superimposing
			<lb />
			their wish upon the company so that action to be taken
			<lb />
			under section 241 &amp; 242 of Companies Act 2013.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			h)
			<lb />
			We have not found any merit in the argument that Articles
			<lb />
			75, 104B, 118, 121 of the Articles of Association per se
			<lb />
			oppressive against the petitioners.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			i)
			<lb />
			We have not found any merit in the argument that Majority
			<lb />
			Rule has taken back seat by introduction of corporate
			<lb />
			governance in Companies Act, 2013, it is like corporate
			<lb />
			democracy is genesis, and corporate governance is
			<lb />
			species. They are never in conflict with each other; the
			<lb />
			management is rather more accountable to the
			<lb />
			shareholders under the present regime. Corporate
			<lb />
			governance is collective responsibility, not based on
			<lb />
			assumed freehand rule which is alien to the concept of
			<lb />
			collective responsibility endowed upon the Board.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			j)
			<lb />
			We have observed that prejudice remedy has been
			<lb />
			included in 2013 Act in addition to oppressive remedy
			<lb />
			already there and also included application of &quot;just and
			<lb />
			equitable&quot; ground as precondition to pass any relief in
			<lb />
			mismanagement issues, which was not the case under old
			<lb />
			Act.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

			7.
			<lb />
			The Approach of NCLAT
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			7.1
			<lb />
			While NCLT dealt with every one of the allegations
			<lb />
			contained in the main company petition and recorded its findings,
			<lb />
			NCLAT, curiously, focused attention only on (i) the removal of CPM
			<lb />
			(ii) the affirmative voting rights of the Directors nominated by the 2
			<lb />
			Trusts in the decision making process and (iii) the amended
			<lb />
			certificate of incorporation issued by the RoC, deleting the word
			<lb />
			&quot;Public&quot; and making it a private company once again.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7.2
			<lb />
			The findings recorded by NCLAT are presented, to a great
			<lb />
			extent, in the language of NCLAT itself, as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The word &apos;unfairly prejudicial&apos; has not been used in Section
			<lb />
			241. The Indian Law (Sections 241 &amp; 242 of the Companies
			<lb />
			Act, 2013) does not recognize the term &apos;legitimate
			<lb />
			expectation&apos; to hold any act prejudicial or oppressive.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(paragraphs 101 and 102 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) In the general meeting of the shareholders of &apos;Tata Sons
			<lb />
			Limited&apos; or the Board of Directors, the majority decision is
			<lb />
			fully dependent upon the affirmative votes of nominated
			<lb />
			Directors of &apos;Tata Trusts&apos;. The affirmative vote of the
			<lb />
			Directors nominated by &apos;Tata Trusts&apos; has an overriding
			<lb />
			effect and renders the majority decision subservient to it.
			<lb />
			(paragraph 115 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) The Tribunal/Appellate Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hold
			<lb />
			any of the Articles as illegal or arbitrary, the terms and
			<lb />
			conditions being agreed upon by the shareholders. However,
			<lb />
			if any action is taken even in accordance with law which is
			<lb />
			&apos;prejudicial&apos; or &apos;oppressive&apos; to any member or members or
			<lb />
			&apos;prejudicial&apos; to the Company or &apos;prejudicial&apos; to the public
			<lb />
			interest, the Tribunal can notice whether the facts would
			<lb />
			justify the winding up of the Company and in such case, if
			<lb />
			the Tribunal holds that it would unfairly prejudice member
			<lb />
			or members or public interest or interest of the Company, it
			<lb />
			may pass appropriate orders in terms of Section 242.
			<lb />
			(paragraph 119 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) The email correspondence dated 18.07.2013, 28.02.2014,
			<lb />
			11.03.2015, 28.05.2015, 03.11.2015 etc. would show that
			<lb />
			CPM was unaware and not in a position to understand how
			<lb />
			decisions are taken by the Tata Trusts before the decision of
			<lb />
			the Board of Directors of Tata Sons and that CPM felt the
			<lb />
			need for development of a governance framework.
			<lb />
			(paragraph 126 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) Emails dated 13th March, 2016; 30th April, 2016 and 10th
			<lb />
			May, 2016 between CPM and Mr. Nitin Nohria show that
			<lb />
			CPM formulated a governance framework after obtaining the
			<lb />
			feedback from Mr. Nitin Nohria to clarify the role of the
			<lb />
			Trustees of &apos;Tata Trusts&apos; in the decision making process of
			<lb />
			&apos;Tata Sons Limited&apos;. It was followed by email dated 15th
			<lb />
			May, 2016 sent by CPM to RNT forwarding a draft of the
			<lb />
			governance framework. (paragraph 127 of the impugned
			<lb />
			order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) The communications between the Respondents from 2013
			<lb />
			to 2016 show that there was complete confusion in the
			<lb />
			Board about the governance framework of the Company
			<lb />
			(&apos;Tata Sons Ltd.&apos;) as before deciding any matter or for taking
			<lb />
			any resolution by the Board, decision used to be taken by
			<lb />
			RNT for &apos;Tata Trusts&apos;, in which Mr. Nitin Nohria and Mr.
			<lb />
			N.A. Soonawala, were taking active part. (paragraph 129 of
			<lb />
			the impugned order)
			<lb />
			(vii) Prior to the Board&apos;s meeting held on 24th October, 2016
			<lb />
			before removing CPM, on the same date decision had
			<lb />
			already been taken by RNT in presence of Mr. Nitin Nohria
			<lb />
			to remove CPM, who asked him to step down from the post
			<lb />
			of the &apos;Executive Chairman&apos; of the Company (&apos;Tata Sons
			<lb />
			Limited&apos;). (paragraph 130 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii) RNT was determined to remove CPM even prior to the
			<lb />
			meeting of the board and the majority shareholders of Tata
			<lb />
			Trust knew that there was a requirement of advance notice
			<lb />
			before the removal of CPM. Therefore, they had taken
			<lb />
			opinion from eminent lawyers and a former Judge of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court. (paragraph 133 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ix) There is nothing on the record to suggest that the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors or any of the trusts, namely-Sir Dorabji Tata
			<lb />
			Trust or the Sir Ratan Tata Trust at any time expressed
			<lb />
			displeasure about the performance of CPM. (paragraph 134
			<lb />
			of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x) From the opening sentence of &apos;Press Statement&apos; dated 10th
			<lb />
			November, 2016, issued by Tata Sons it is clear that sudden
			<lb />
			and hasty removal of CPM as Executive Chairman of &apos;Tata
			<lb />
			Sons Limited&apos; raised concerns in the industrial group.
			<lb />
			(paragraph 137 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xi) The allegations as made in the &apos;Press Statement&apos; dated 10th
			<lb />
			November, 2016 appears to be an afterthought as the
			<lb />
			aforesaid matter was not discussed in any of the meetings
			<lb />
			of the Board of Directors. The allegations in the &apos;Press
			<lb />
			Statement&apos; as not supported by record cannot be accepted.
			<lb />
			(paragraph 139 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xii) Correspondence between CPM, RNT, Mr. Nitin Nohria and
			<lb />
			Mr. N.A. Soonawala show that all the time CPM had been
			<lb />
			pointing out that some of the &apos;Tata Companies&apos; were
			<lb />
			suffering losses and if appropriate steps were not taken, it
			<lb />
			may aggravate in future. In spite of such communications
			<lb />
			no decision for the revival or restructuring of Tata
			<lb />
			Companies was taken. (paragraph 140 of the impugned
			<lb />
			order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xiii) If there was a failure and loss caused to one or other Tata
			<lb />
			Company which also affected the &apos;Tata Sons Limited&apos;, the
			<lb />
			&apos;Tata Trusts&apos; or the Board of Directors could not be absolved
			<lb />
			of its responsibility, particularly when the nominee
			<lb />
			Directors of the Tata Trusts who have affirmative vote to
			<lb />
			reverse the majority decision. (paragraph 141 of the
			<lb />
			impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xiv) If all major decisions are taken in advance by the &apos;Tata
			<lb />
			Trusts&apos; and for taking every decision, matters are to be
			<lb />
			placed before the &apos;Tata Trusts&apos;, the independence of the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors of the Company becomes irrelevant.
			<lb />
			(paragraph 143 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xv) The suggestions made by CPM for good governance by the
			<lb />
			Board and to take care of Tata Companies, including &apos;Tata
			<lb />
			Motors&apos;, &apos;Docomo&apos; etc., were not taken in its letter and spirit
			<lb />
			by RNT or &apos;Tata Trusts&apos; which resulted in no confidence on
			<lb />
			CPM. (paragraph 144 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xvi) The record suggests that the removal of CPM had nothing to
			<lb />
			do with any lack of performance. On the other hand, the
			<lb />
			material on record shows that the Company under the
			<lb />
			leadership of CPM performed well which was praised by the
			<lb />
			&apos;Nomination and Remuneration Committee&apos; a Statutory
			<lb />
			Committee under Section 178, on 28th June, 2016 i.e. just
			<lb />
			few months before he was removed. (paragraph 146 of the
			<lb />
			impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xvii) Nominee Director Mr. Vijay Singh on behalf of &apos;Tata Trusts&apos;
			<lb />
			was well aware that performance of CPM was satisfactory
			<lb />
			and there was need for a framework for operationalizing the
			<lb />
			Articles. (paragraph 149 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xviii) The annual performance review of the &apos;Nomination and
			<lb />
			Remuneration Committee&apos; was unanimously approved by
			<lb />
			the Board of Directors of &apos;Tata Sons&apos; in its meeting held on
			<lb />
			the next day i.e. on 29th June, 2016. (paragraph 150 of the
			<lb />
			impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xix) Three Directors who also voted for removal of CPM,
			<lb />
			including Mr. Amit Chandra, who spearheaded the removal
			<lb />
			proceedings and Mr. Ajay Piramal and Mr. Venu Srinivasan,
			<lb />
			had been inducted into the Board of &apos;Tata Sons Ltd.&apos; only on
			<lb />
			8th August, 2016 i.e. after the appraisal report of
			<lb />
			&apos;Nomination and Remuneration Committee&apos;. They attended
			<lb />
			just one Board meeting prior to the meeting held on 24th
			<lb />
			October, 2016. (paragraph 151 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
			(xx) Two of the Directors, Mr. Ranendra Sen and Mr. Vijay
			<lb />
			Singh, a Trust Nominee Director, who voted for the removal
			<lb />
			of CPM, were members of the &apos;Nomination and
			<lb />
			Remuneration Committee&apos; which just four months&apos; prior to
			<lb />
			his removal on 28th June, 2016 praised the performance of
			<lb />
			CPM as Executive Chairman. These two Directors also voted
			<lb />
			against CPM just four months thereafter which has not
			<lb />
			been explained by Mr. Ranendra Sen and Mr. Vijay Singh.
			<lb />
			Further, what is accepted is that prior to the meeting held
			<lb />
			on 24th October, 2016 between 2.00 p.m. to 3.00 p.m., in
			<lb />
			the forenoon, the &apos;Tata Trusts&apos; in a separate meeting
			<lb />
			decided to remove CPM. Even before decision of &apos;Tata
			<lb />
			Trusts&apos;, RNT in presence of Mr. Nitin Nohria called CPM and
			<lb />
			asked him to resign. (paragraph 152 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xxi) In view of what transpired, it is not open to the
			<lb />
			Respondents to state or allege that loss in different &apos;Tata
			<lb />
			Companies&apos; was due to mismanagement of CPM. If that be
			<lb />
			so, why the nominated Directors who have affirmative
			<lb />
			voting right over the majority decision of the Board or in the
			<lb />
			Annual General Meeting of the shareholders allowed the
			<lb />
			&apos;Tata Companies&apos; to function in a manner which caused
			<lb />
			loss, as accepted in the press release dated 10th November,
			<lb />
			2016. The consecutive chain of events coming to fore from
			<lb />
			the correspondence amply demonstrates that impairment of
			<lb />
			confidence with reference to conduct of affairs of company
			<lb />
			was not attributable to probity qua CPM but to unfair abuse
			<lb />
			of powers on the part of other Respondents. (paragraph 155
			<lb />
			of the impugned order)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xxii) Even in the absence of a right of minority members
			<lb />
			(&apos;Shapoorji Pallonji Group&apos;), because of the healthy
			<lb />
			atmosphere and clear understanding between two groups
			<lb />
			i.e. &apos;Tata Group&apos; and &apos;Shapoorji Pallonji Group&apos; for the last
			<lb />
			40 years, except for few years in between thereof, one of the
			<lb />
			persons of &apos;Shapoorji Pallonji Group&apos; was made as the
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman or Director, which includes CPM and
			<lb />
			his father Mr. Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry. (paragraph 160 of
			<lb />
			the impugned order)
			<lb />
			(xxiii) &apos;Shapoorji Pallonji Group&apos;, minority shareholders, all the
			<lb />
			time had confidence on the decision making power of the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors of the &apos;Tata Sons Ltd.&apos; as amity and
			<lb />
			goodwill prevailed inter se the two groups. (paragraph 161
			<lb />
			of the impugned order)
			<lb />
			(xxiv) Because of recent actions of &apos;Tata Trusts&apos;, its nominee
			<lb />
			Directors, and RNT and Mr. Nitin Nohria, taken since the
			<lb />
			year 2013, as noticed and discussed and sudden and hasty
			<lb />
			removal of CPM on 24th October, 2016, without any basis,
			<lb />
			and without following the normal procedure under Article
			<lb />
			118, the minority group (&apos;Shapoorji Pallonji Group&apos;) (the
			<lb />
			Appellants), and others have raised no confidence and
			<lb />
			sense of uncertainty. (paragraph 162 of impugned order)
			<lb />
			(xxv) The prejudicial action, did not come to an end, after 24th
			<lb />
			October, 2016, when CPM was removed as Executive
			<lb />
			Chairman and Director of the Company (&apos;Tata Sons
			<lb />
			Limited&apos;). It continued even thereafter with the removal of
			<lb />
			CPM from the Directorship of other group companies and
			<lb />
			the conversion of Tata Sons Limited from being a public
			<lb />
			limited company into a private company, after the decision
			<lb />
			of NCLT. (paragraph 165 of the impugned order)
			<lb />
			(xxvi)Tata Sons Limited became a public company by virtue of
			<lb />
			Section 43(1A) of the Companies Act, 1956 on the basis of
			<lb />
			average annual turnover, w.e.f. 01.02.1975. (para 165) In
			<lb />
			terms of Subsection (2) of Section 43A Tata Sons informed
			<lb />
			the Registrar and the Registrar deleted the word &quot;private&quot; in
			<lb />
			the name of the Company upon the Register. By virtue of
			<lb />
			Subsection (4), such a company is to continue to be a
			<lb />
			public company until it becomes a private company with
			<lb />
			the approval of the Central Government and in accordance
			<lb />
			with the Act. (para 167) The Companies Act, 2013 repealed
			<lb />
			part of the 1956 Act. The new Act defines a &quot;Private
			<lb />
			Company&quot; and a &quot;Public Company&quot; under Clauses (68) and
			<lb />
			(71) of Section 2. (para 169 to 172). Under the 2013 Act,
			<lb />
			there is no provision similar to Section 43A(1A), for
			<lb />
			automatic conversion of a company. Since there is no
			<lb />
			automatic conversion, Tata Sons, having become a public
			<lb />
			company long ago was required to alter its articles of
			<lb />
			Association by following the procedure prescribed by
			<lb />
			Section 14(1)(b) read with Section 14(2) and 14(3), for
			<lb />
			converting the company as a private company.( paras 173
			<lb />
			to 175). The General Circular No.15 of 2013 dated
			<lb />
			13.09.2013 and Notification dated 12.09.2013 issued by the
			<lb />
			central Government cannot override Section 14 of the Act
			<lb />
			(para 177) and hence the action taken by Tata Sons
			<lb />
			hurriedly to get the word &quot;public&quot; struck off in the certificate
			<lb />
			of incorporation, after the order of NCLT is absolutely
			<lb />
			illegal.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xxvii) The aforesaid action on the part of the company and its
			<lb />
			Board of Directors to take action to hurriedly change the
			<lb />
			Company (&apos;Tata sons Limited&apos;) from &apos;Public Company&apos; to a
			<lb />
			&apos;Private Company&apos; without following the procedure under
			<lb />
			law (Section 14), with the help of the Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies just before the filing the appeal, suggests that
			<lb />
			the nominated members of &apos;Tata Trusts&apos; who have
			<lb />
			affirmative voting right over the majority decision of the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors and other Directors/members, acted in a
			<lb />

			<lb />
			incurred loss in spite of decision making powers vested with
			<lb />
			the Board of Directors with affirmative power of nominated
			<lb />
			Directors of the &apos;Tata Trust&apos;; the manner in which Mr. Cyrus

			discussion in the meeting of the Board of Directors held on

			Mr. Ratan N. Tata (2 nd Respondent), Mr. Nitin Nohria (7 th

			<lb />
			and winding up of the Company would unfairly prejudice

			the members, but otherwise the facts, as narrated above,
			<lb />
			would justify a winding up order on the ground that it was
			<lb />
			just and equitable that the Company should be wound up

			and thereby, it is a fit case to pass order under Section 242
			<lb />
			of the Companies Act, 2013.

			8. Important difference between the approach of NCLT and the
			<lb />
			approach of NCLAT
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			8.1
			<lb />
			As pointed out at the beginning of chapter 7, NCLT dealt
			<lb />
			with every one of the allegations of oppression and mismanagement
			<lb />
			and recorded reasoned findings. But NCLAT, despite being a final
			<lb />
			court of facts, did not deal with the allegations one by one nor did
			<lb />
			the NCLAT render any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of
			<lb />
			the findings recorded by NCLT. Instead, the NCLAT summarised in
			<lb />
			one paragraph, namely paragraph 183, its conclusion on some of
			<lb />
			the allegations, without any kind of reasoning. This Paragraph 183
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The facts, as noticed above, including the affirmative voting
			<lb />
			power of the nominated Directors of the &apos;Tata Trusts&apos; over
			<lb />
			majority decision of the Board; actions taken by Mr. Ratan N.
			<lb />
			Tata (2nd Respondent), Mr. Nitin Nohria (7th Respondent) and Mr.
			<lb />
			N.A.Soonawala (14th Respondent) and others as discussed
			<lb />
			above; the fact that the Company (&apos;Tata Sons Limited&apos;) has
			<lb />
			suffered loss because of &apos;prejudicial&apos; decisions taken by Board of
			<lb />
			Directors; the fact that a number of &apos;Tata Companies&apos; have
			<lb />
			incurred loss; in spite of decision making power vested with the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors with affirmative power of nominated Directors
			<lb />
			of the &apos;Tata Trusts&apos;; the action in making change from &apos;Public
			<lb />
			Company&apos; to &apos;Private Company&apos;; the manner in which Mr. Cyrus
			<lb />
			Pallonji Mistry (11th Respondent) was suddenly and hastily
			<lb />
			removed without any reason and in absence of any discussion in
			<lb />
			the meeting shown in the Board of Directors held on 24th October,
			<lb />
			2016 and his subsequent removal as Director(s) of different &apos;Tata
			<lb />
			Companies&apos;, coupled with global effect of such removal, as
			<lb />
			accepted by the Company in its &apos;Press Statement&apos; form a
			<lb />
			consecutive chain of events with cumulative effect justifying us to
			<lb />
			hold that the Appellants have made out a clear case of
			<lb />
			&apos;prejudicial&apos; and &apos;oppressive&apos; action by contesting Respondents,
			<lb />
			including Mr. Ratan N. Tata (2nd Respondent), Mr. Nitin Nohria
			<lb />
			(7th Respondent) and Mr. N.A.Soonawala (14th Respondent) and
			<lb />
			other, the nominee Directors.

			8.2
			<lb />
			The allegations relating to (i) over priced and bleeding
			<lb />
			Corus acquisition (ii) doomed Nano car project (iii) undue favours to
			<lb />
			Siva and Sterling (iv) loan by Kalimati to Siva (v) sale of flat to Mehli
			<lb />
			Mistry (vi) the unjust enrichment of the companies controlled by
			<lb />
			Mehli Mistry (vii) the Aviation industry misadventures (viii) losses
			<lb />
			due to purchase of the shares of Tata Motors etc., were not
			<lb />
			individually dealt with by NCLAT, though NCLT had addressed each
			<lb />
			one of these issues and recorded findings in favour of Tata Sons.
			<lb />
			Therefore, there is no escape from the conclusion that NCLAT
			<lb />
			did not expressly overturn the findings of facts recorded by
			<lb />
			NCLT, on these allegations. We are constrained to take note of
			<lb />
			this, even at the outset, in view of a contention raised by Shri
			<lb />
			Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel for the SP group, that in an
			<lb />
			appeal under Section 423 of the Companies Act, 2013, this court
			<lb />
			will not normally interfere with a finding of fact reached by NCLAT,
			<lb />
			unless it is found to be wholly perverse.

			<lb />
			Contentions on behalf of Tata Sons, group companies and
			<lb />
			Trustees
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			9.1
			<lb />
			Assailing the judgment of NCLAT, Shri Harish Salve and
			<lb />
			Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior counsel for Tata Sons
			<lb />
			contended as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The entire focus of NCLAT was only on the justification for the
			<lb />
			removal of CPM from the post of Executive Chairman of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons, despite the fact that the positive case of the complainant
			<lb />
			companies as well as CPM was that they were not seeking the
			<lb />
			reinstatement of CPM;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) In focusing entirely upon the removal of CPM from Executive
			<lb />
			Chairmanship of Tata Sons, NCLAT lost track of the law that
			<lb />
			such a removal cannot be termed as oppression or
			<lb />
			mismanagement;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) NCLAT went completely overboard by directing the
			<lb />
			reinstatement of CPM as the Executive Chairman of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			and also annulling the appointment of the new Chairman N.
			<lb />
			Chandrasekaran;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) NCLAT went completely out of the way in directing the
			<lb />
			reinstatement of CPM as a Director of even the operating
			<lb />
			companies, the management of affairs of which, were not even
			<lb />
			the subject matter. The subject matter concerned only the
			<lb />
			management of the affairs of Tata Sons and not its Group
			<lb />
			Companies;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) NCLAT failed to see that the &quot;just and equitable clause&quot; is
			<lb />
			triggered only in two situations namely: (a) wherever there was
			<lb />
			a functional deadlock; and (b) wherever there was a corporate
			<lb />
			quasi partnership in which there was a breakdown of trust
			<lb />
			and confidence. In the case on hand there was no preexisting
			<lb />
			partnership between Tata Group and the S.P. Group. S.P.
			<lb />
			Group became shareholders only after 48 years of the
			<lb />
			incorporation of Tata Sons and they did not even hold any
			<lb />
			directorial position until June1980. Therefore S.P. Group
			<lb />
			never had any right of management nor a right that could
			<lb />
			emanate from a preexisting relationship of trust and
			<lb />
			confidence, before the incorporation of the company;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) Tata sons was not a &quot;Two Group&quot; company with one of them
			<lb />
			being a majority and the other, a minority. S.P. Group became
			<lb />
			shareholders long after the incorporation of the company and
			<lb />
			they did not acquire any privilege, prerogative or right. S.P.
			<lb />
			Group became shareholders, accepting the rights and
			<lb />
			obligations inter se among shareholders, as spelt out by the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association. S.P. Group also accepted without any
			<lb />
			demur, all the amendments made to the Articles of
			<lb />
			Association, when Pallonji Mistry was on the Board and also
			<lb />
			when CPM was on the Board;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) The removal of CPM was on account of the loss of confidence in
			<lb />
			CPM and the complete breakdown of trust between the other
			<lb />
			members of the Board and CPM. To say that his removal
			<lb />
			required the stamp of approval of the Selection Committee, is
			<lb />
			completely amiss;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii) NCLAT failed to appreciate in the right perspective, the effects
			<lb />
			of the Amendment Act 53 of 2000 on a &apos;deemed to be a public
			<lb />
			company&apos; under Section 43A and the provisions of the 2013
			<lb />
			Act, while dealing with the question whether Tata Sons would
			<lb />
			be a private Company or a public Company. NCLAT, without
			<lb />
			any justification, made uncharitable remarks against the
			<lb />
			Registrar of Companies for issuing an amended certificate of
			<lb />
			incorporation after the judgment of NCLT, though RoC was not
			<lb />
			a party. When RoC sought the expunction of those remarks by
			<lb />
			filing an application, NCLAT entertained the same, only for the
			<lb />
			purpose of improving upon the reasons already provided,
			<lb />
			showing thereby the mindset with which NCLAT approached
			<lb />
			the case;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ix) NCLAT committed a serious error in whittling down Article 75
			<lb />
			of the Articles of Association, though the said Article was not
			<lb />
			found to be illegal;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x) Curiously NCLAT did not find any actual misuse of the Articles
			<lb />
			of Association, which envisaged a crucial role for the nominee
			<lb />
			Directors of the two Trusts. CPM himself had proposed a
			<lb />
			Governance framework which recognised preconsultation
			<lb />
			with the Trusts. Therefore, the findings of NCLAT as though
			<lb />
			the preconsultation as well as the affirmative voting right
			<lb />
			conferred upon the Directors nominated by the Trust,
			<lb />
			undermined the role of the Board of Directors of Tata Sons,
			<lb />
			are completely perverse;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xi) The direction issued by NCLAT to the majority (Tata Group) to
			<lb />
			consult the S.P. Group, for all future appointments of
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman or Director, is wholly unsustainable in
			<lb />
			law. This direction tantamount to striking down Articles 104B
			<lb />
			and 118, even though the challenge to these Articles had
			<lb />
			already been given up.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<head>
			10. Contentions on behalf of S.P. Group:
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			10.1
			<lb />
			Shri C. Aryama Sundaram, learned Senior counsel,
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of the S.P. Group raised the following
			<lb />
			contentions, both in defense of that portion of the judgment of
			<lb />
			NCLAT which had gone in their favour and also for attacking NCLAT
			<lb />
			for not going further:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Tata Sons could very well be treated as a two group company
			<lb />
			where the relationship between the groups was in the nature
			<lb />
			of a quasi partnership, which created equitable obligations.
			<lb />
			The relationship between the family of CPM and the Tata
			<lb />
			family, spans over seven decades and was one of trust and
			<lb />
			mutual confidence. S.P. Group had acted as the guardian of
			<lb />
			Tata Group&apos;s interest when the Trust had no affirmative voting
			<lb />
			rights;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The existence of a quasi partnership can be presumed
			<lb />
			whenever it is found (a) that an Association was formed or
			<lb />
			continued on the basis of a relationship involving mutual trust
			<lb />
			and confidence; (b) that there was an understanding that some
			<lb />
			of the members would participate in the management of the
			<lb />
			company; or (c) that there was a restriction upon the transfer
			<lb />
			of the member&apos;s interest in the company. One or more of these
			<lb />
			elements were found to exist in the relationship between Tata
			<lb />
			Group and S.P. Group and hence it was in the nature of quasi
			<lb />
			partnership;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) The Trustees misused the Articles of Association to undermine
			<lb />
			the Board of Directors of Tata Sons and also caused erosion of
			<lb />
			their ability to exercise independent judgment and to act in
			<lb />
			the interest of the Company. RNT as well as Soonawala
			<lb />
			demanded preconsultation and prior clearance of the agenda
			<lb />
			items to be placed before the Board. There were instances (a)
			<lb />
			when the TrustNominee Directors objected to matters being
			<lb />
			placed before the Board without the approval of the Trust, (b)
			<lb />
			when RNT edited the minutes of the Board meetings that he
			<lb />
			did not attend, (c) when RNT questioned certain operational
			<lb />
			and business decisions of Tata Motors, (d) when the Trustees
			<lb />
			overruled the views of the Tata Group legal counsel in the
			<lb />
			DoCoMo disputes and (e) when the Trustees interfered in
			<lb />
			business decisions such as Welspun acquisition and rights
			<lb />
			issue of Tata Motors;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) Tata sons was a public company in form and conduct, as they
			<lb />
			accepted public deposits even after 13.12.2000 till September
			<lb />
			2002 and hence the conversion of the company into a private
			<lb />
			company by a hand written order of the ROC, effected at night
			<lb />
			just before NCLAT was to hear the appeals, was completely
			<lb />
			shocking. The conversion of the company into a private
			<lb />
			company was aimed at avoiding a higher standard of scrutiny
			<lb />
			statutorily required for public companies. The conversion also
			<lb />
			adversely affected the ability of Tata Sons to raise funds,
			<lb />
			thereby increasing borrowing costs. Due to this conversion,
			<lb />
			Tata Sons became obliged to refund money to insurance
			<lb />
			companies which held substantial investments in the
			<lb />
			instruments issued by the company. Therefore the conversion
			<lb />
			of the company into a private company lacked probity and
			<lb />
			prejudiced the proprietary rights of minority shareholders;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) The removal of CPM was contrary to the provisions of Article
			<lb />
			118, which required the setting up of a Selection Committee
			<lb />
			both for appointment as well as removal. In fact Article 121B
			<lb />
			contemplates a 15 days&apos; notice, but the same was also not
			<lb />
			complied. Therefore, the removal of CPM, carried out without
			<lb />
			there being any agenda for the same and without there being
			<lb />
			any deliberation or discussion, was wholly illegal. The manner
			<lb />
			in which three Directors were inducted into the Board without
			<lb />
			being vetted by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee
			<lb />
			and the manner in which the resolution for removal was
			<lb />
			passed would show that it was preplanned. It was quite
			<lb />
			strange that CPM&apos;s performance came to be appreciated by the
			<lb />
			Nomination and Remuneration Committee in June2016 and
			<lb />
			this Committee had two members, who later became parties to
			<lb />
			the resolution removing him from Executive Chairmanship;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) The removal of CPM from the Directorship of Tata Sons as well
			<lb />
			as the Directorship of the other Group Companies showed
			<lb />
			complete lack of probity, since veiled threats were sent to the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors of the other group companies for the
			<lb />
			withdrawal of the Tata brand, if they failed to fall in line.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			10.2
			<lb />
			Carrying the baton from Shri Aryama Sundaram, it was
			<lb />
			contended by Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior counsel, as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			With the coming into force of the Companies Act, 2013, law
			<lb />
			has moved from &apos;corporate majority&apos; or &apos;Corporate
			<lb />
			democracy&apos; to &apos;corporate governance&apos;, which includes the
			<lb />
			principles of fairness. This is seen from sections 135, 148,
			<lb />
			151, 166 and 177.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Law now enjoins companies to be operated and managed
			<lb />
			within a statutory framework i.e. by a Board of Directors
			<lb />
			and no one else, as per s.149 of the 2013 Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Directors of companies have a fiduciary role visàvis the
			<lb />
			company with the highest level of duty, which cannot be
			<lb />
			outsourced or delegated and their allegiance should only be
			<lb />
			to the company alone.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) Once a director is appointed, his duty is only to the
			<lb />
			company and none else, irrespective of how he is appointed.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) There was a series of acts of oppression, including the
			<lb />
			breach of Articles, misuse of Articles and also a violation of
			<lb />
			the essential understanding between the two groups. This
			<lb />
			was found by the NCLAT.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) There was a clear lack of probity and honesty in the
			<lb />
			dealings of the majority. The concept of probity is much
			<lb />
			broader and wider than integrity.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) There was a long good faith relationship between the Tata
			<lb />
			group and SP group, developed over several decades and
			<lb />
			this has to be viewed in the context of a specific statutory
			<lb />
			framework that existed from 1964 upto 2000.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii) In matters of this nature, the Court is obliged, in its
			<lb />
			equitable jurisdiction, to take note of the status of the
			<lb />
			company in question, which is at the top (apex) of the
			<lb />
			pyramid, with several stakeholders including the minority
			<lb />
			shareholders of the company itself, the employees and
			<lb />
			shareholders of the operating companies controlled by the
			<lb />
			company etc.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ix) NCLAT has recorded detailed findings on facts and there is
			<lb />
			no perversity in those findings. Therefore there is actually
			<lb />
			no scope for interference by this court.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x) The reliefs sought in the company petition, are consistent
			<lb />
			with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 including
			<lb />
			Section 163 (proportionate representation) and sub
			<lb />
			Sections (1), (5), (7) and (8) of Section 242 of the Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			10.3
			<lb />
			Mr. Janak Dwarakadas, learned counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of CPM, the original composer of this musical ensemble,
			<lb />
			raised the following contentions:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Lack of financial probity is not the only ground on which
			<lb />
			the &apos;just and equitable&apos; clause for winding up can be
			<lb />
			invoked. Infraction of a legal and/or proprietary right is also
			<lb />
			a ground for invoking it.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Proprietary right includes the right to be governed in
			<lb />
			accordance with the Articles of Association and the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Act. Independence and autonomy of Board
			<lb />
			is guaranteed by law. Interference by majority shareholders
			<lb />
			that encroaches upon the Board&apos;s autonomy and
			<lb />
			independence, is an infraction upon the proprietary rights
			<lb />
			of minority shareholders.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Art. 104B, 121 and 121A have been misinterpreted,
			<lb />
			misconstrued and misapplied to mean that majority
			<lb />
			shareholders have a right to seek preconsultation or pre
			<lb />
			clearance before matters can be placed before the Board of
			<lb />
			Tata Sons or Tata Operating Companies. The right to
			<lb />
			nominate 1/3rd directors by Tata Trusts (A.104B), the
			<lb />
			requirement of affirmative vote of a majority of nominee
			<lb />
			directors (A.121) and Article 121A, do not alter the fact that
			<lb />
			nominee directors have a fiduciary duty in exercising these
			<lb />
			powers to act in the interests of the company alone. Article
			<lb />
			122(b) provided that Tata Sons shall be boardmanaged.
			<lb />
			But the true legal scope and meaning of these Articles were
			<lb />
			never understood.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) The role and duties of nominee Directors should have been
			<lb />
			well defined and kept within the confines of law.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) The Nomination and remuneration Committee, in its
			<lb />
			meeting held on June 28, 2016, expressed the need for
			<lb />
			clarity on the functioning of the Board of Tata Sons in
			<lb />
			relation to Tata Trusts as well as its role visavis the group
			<lb />
			companies.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) NCLAT has recorded a finding that 3 attempts were made
			<lb />
			by CPM to place before the Board of Tata Sons, a
			<lb />
			governance structure and that this became the principal
			<lb />
			cause for his removal. This finding of fact cannot be set at
			<lb />
			naught by this court.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<head>
			11 Contentions on behalf of the Tata Trusts
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			Assailing the judgment of NCLAT, Shri Mohan Parasaran,
			<lb />
			learned Senior counsel appearing for the Trusts, contended as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Impugned judgment did not deal with the detailed findings
			<lb />
			of fact rendered by NCLT, nor the arguments advanced on
			<lb />
			behalf of the Trustees of the Tata Trust.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Impugned judgment employed erroneous tests to determine
			<lb />
			oppression under section 241 of the 2013 Act
			<lb />
			(iii) Mere unwise or loss making business decisions etc. cannot
			<lb />
			be construed as acts of mismanagement so as to justify
			<lb />
			winding up on just and equitable grounds. For holding the
			<lb />
			majority guilty (a) there must be a sequential chain of
			<lb />
			events leading up to the date of filing the petition; (b) the
			<lb />
			conduct must be burdensome, harsh and wrongful qua the
			<lb />
			minority; and (c) there must be an element of lack of probity
			<lb />
			depriving the proprietary rights of the SP group as
			<lb />
			shareholders.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) This is not a case of quasipartnership
			<lb />
			(v) Impugned judgment is replete with erroneous findings of
			<lb />
			fact that influenced the conclusions drawn and reliefs
			<lb />
			granted
			<lb />
			(vi) Impugned judgment misattributes the replacement of CPM
			<lb />
			to RNT and grants reliefs that were not prayed for.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) Though the TrustNominee Director introduced the
			<lb />
			resolution for CPM&apos;s removal, it was ultimately the majority
			<lb />
			of the Board that voted in favor of the resolution.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii) Impugned judgment goes against the fundamentals of
			<lb />
			corporate democracy by taking away basic rights of
			<lb />
			shareholders
			<lb />
			(ix) By directing that all future appointments to directorial
			<lb />
			positions in Tata Sons can be made only through mutual
			<lb />
			&quot;consultation&quot; with the SP Group and that only a person
			<lb />
			&quot;on whom both the groups have trust&quot; can be appointed,
			<lb />
			NCLAT has undermined the role of majority. This could
			<lb />
			create a stalemate and an impasse by giving minority
			<lb />
			shareholders a veto power.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x) This direction also renders mute, the right of the Tata
			<lb />
			Trusts to nominate directors under Art.104B even though
			<lb />
			its validity was not under challenge before NCLAT.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xi) Impugned judgment&apos;s interpretation of affirmative voting
			<lb />
			rights u/ Art 121 is conceptually and legally wrong.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xii) NCLAT took the affirmative right to mean unilateral power
			<lb />
			to implement decisions (referencing para 155 of the
			<lb />
			judgment).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<head>
			12. Contentions of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			Attacking one portion of the judgment of NCLAT which issued
			<lb />
			a direction to TCS to reinstate CPM as a Director, Ms. Fereshte D.
			<lb />
			Sethna, learned counsel appearing for TCS argued as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			NCLAT lacked jurisdiction to direct CPM&apos;s reinstatement, as
			<lb />
			TCS was not party to the original proceedings or appellate
			<lb />
			proceedings. Neither the SP Group, nor CPM had prayed for
			<lb />
			reinstatement of CPM to the board of directors of TCS
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			(ii) Due process was followed in the removal of CPM from the
			<lb />
			board of TCS. CPM was granted opportunity to make a
			<lb />
			representation against the proposed resolution for his
			<lb />
			removal in compliance with section 169 of the Companies
			<lb />
			Act. Unanimous approval was granted by the board of
			<lb />
			directors of TCS at their meeting dated 17.11.2016 for
			<lb />
			convening an EGM for removal of CPM from the board of
			<lb />
			directors. Circulation of representation against his proposed
			<lb />
			removal on 05.12.2016 was made by CPM to members.
			<lb />
			Requisite majority of shareholders (93.11%) passed
			<lb />
			resolution at EGM dated 13.12.2016, for the removal of
			<lb />
			CPM. 57.46% of public institutional shareholders were in
			<lb />
			favor of the resolution for his removal. Further, 71.88% of
			<lb />
			public shareholders were in favor of resolution for his
			<lb />
			removal.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Action against TCS not maintainable by the SP Group as
			<lb />
			they did not meet the requisite threshold under section 244
			<lb />
			of the Companies Act, 2013. The SP Group held only 0.24%
			<lb />
			in direct equity interests in TCS which stood at 0.55% on
			<lb />
			13.12.2016, and has since been diluted to 0.05% on
			<lb />
			18.12.2019 -the date of the impugned order.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) There was no allegation of oppression and mismanagement
			<lb />
			made out against TCS.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			TCS was denied the opportunity of hearing which was
			<lb />
			contrary to the principles of natural justice.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) NCLAT lacked jurisdiction to grant reinstatement as CPM&apos;s
			<lb />
			tenure of office came to an end on 16.06.2017.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<head>
			13. Contentions of others
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			13.1
			<lb />
			Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General, appearing
			<lb />
			on behalf of the Registrar of Companies, made submissions to the
			<lb />
			limited extent of justifying the action of the RoC in issuing an
			<lb />
			amended certificate of incorporation. According to him, the Articles
			<lb />
			of Association of Tata Sons contained provisions which come within
			<lb />
			the parameters of the definition of a &apos;private company&apos; under section
			<lb />
			2(68) of the Act. The amendment merely recognized a preexisting
			<lb />
			reality and the RoC followed the extant provisions of the Act. But
			<lb />
			unfortunately, the NCLAT passed remarks, though it claimed it did
			<lb />
			not, without even hearing the RoC beforehand.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13.2
			<lb />
			Shri Zal Andhyarjuna, learned counsel appearing for Shri
			<lb />
			Noshir A. Soonawala, submitted that Soonawala has never been
			<lb />
			accused of wrongdoing in his 44 years of association with the Tata
			<lb />
			Group and even during CPM&apos;s tenure as Director. He has not
			<lb />
			attended a single meeting of the Board of Directors of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			since his retirement. He was requested to act as advisor to Tata
			<lb />
			Sons which received unanimous approval of the Board in 2010.
			<lb />
			CPM would therefore, approach him from time to time for advice on
			<lb />
			financial matters of Tata Sons. Soonawala has, on his own
			<lb />
			initiative, sent only two notes to CPM and RNT which were purely
			<lb />
			advisory in nature and cannot be construed as being &quot;directions&quot; or
			<lb />
			&quot;instructions&quot; from him. The Note dated 04.12.2015 was an
			<lb />
			analysis of Tata Sons&apos; past financial results pointing out areas of
			<lb />
			concern and the Memo dated 09.07.2015 concerned Tata Tele
			<lb />
			Services Limited, an unlisted company having financial problems.
			<lb />
			Therefore, he argued that NCLAT was wrong in attributing to him,
			<lb />
			interference with the affairs of Tata Sons.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			14. Questions of law arising for consideration
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			14.1
			<lb />
			Though the learned counsel for the parties have raised
			<lb />
			innumerable contentions touching upon every aspect, micro or
			<lb />
			macro, and which we have faithfully recorded in paragraphs 9 to 13
			<lb />
			above, the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 423 of the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 2013, is primarily to answer questions of law
			<lb />
			arising out of the proceedings before the Tribunal and Appellate
			<lb />
			Tribunal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14.2
			<lb />
			Therefore, from the rival contentions, the questions of
			<lb />
			law that arise are formulated as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Whether the formation of opinion by the Appellate
			<lb />
			Tribunal that the company&apos;s affairs have been or are
			<lb />
			being conducted in a manner prejudicial and oppressive
			<lb />
			to some members and that the facts otherwise justify the
			<lb />
			winding up of the company on just and equitable ground,
			<lb />
			is in tune with the well settled principles and parameters,
			<lb />
			especially in the light of the fact that the findings of NCLT
			<lb />
			on facts were not individually and specifically overturned
			<lb />
			by the Appellate Tribunal ?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Whether the reliefs granted and the directions
			<lb />
			issued by the Appellate Tribunal, including the
			<lb />
			reinstatement of CPM into the Board of Tata Sons and
			<lb />
			other Tata companies, are in consonance with the
			<lb />
			pleadings made, the reliefs sought and the powers
			<lb />
			available under Subsection (2) of Section 242 ?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Whether the Appellate Tribunal could have, in law,
			<lb />
			muted the power of the Company under Article 75 of the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association, to demand any member to
			<lb />
			transfer his ordinary shares, by simply injuncting the
			<lb />
			company from exercising such a right without setting
			<lb />
			aside the Article ?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) Whether the characterisation by the Tribunal, of the
			<lb />
			affirmative voting rights available under Article 121 to the
			<lb />
			Directors nominated by the Trusts in terms of Article
			<lb />
			104B, as oppressive and prejudicial, is justified especially
			<lb />
			after the challenge to these Articles have been given up
			<lb />
			expressly and whether the Tribunal could have granted a
			<lb />
			direction to RNT and the Nominee Directors virtually
			<lb />
			nullifying the effect of these Articles ?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) whether the reconversion of Tata Sons from a public
			<lb />
			company into a private company, required the necessary
			<lb />
			approval under section 14 of the Companies Act, 2013 or at
			<lb />
			least an action under section 43A(4) of the Companies Act,
			<lb />
			1956 during the period from 2000 (when Act 53 of 2000
			<lb />
			came into force) to 2013 (when the 2013 Act was enacted)
			<lb />
			as held by NCLAT ?

			15. Legislative History of Oppression, Mismanagement and
			<lb />
			Unfair Prejudice
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			15.1
			<lb />
			Before we take up the questions of law formulated above
			<lb />
			for consideration, we think it would be useful to look at the
			<lb />
			legislative history of oppression, mismanagement and prejudice/
			<lb />
			unfair prejudice, both in England and India, as colonial vintage
			<lb />
			continues to haunt us (fortunately or unfortunately), both in
			<lb />
			legislative drafting and in judicial decision making even till date.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			In England
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			15.2
			<lb />
			The history of legislative action to regulate incorporated
			<lb />
			companies, in England, is just 176 years old. It begins with the
			<lb />
			Joint Stock Companies Act, 1844. Until then, the government
			<lb />
			created corporations under a Royal Charter or an Act of Parliament
			<lb />
			with the grant of a monopoly over a specified territory. The best
			<lb />
			known example is the British East India Company, to which Queen
			<lb />
			Elizabeth I granted the exclusive right to trade with all countries to
			<lb />
			the east of the Cape of Good Hope. During this period, Corporations
			<lb />
			essentially used to act on the government&apos;s behalf, bringing in
			<lb />
			revenue from their exploits abroad.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.3
			<lb />
			A chartered company (similar to East India Company),
			<lb />
			known as the South Sea Company, was established in 1711 to
			<lb />
			trade in the Spanish South American colonies. The South Sea
			<lb />
			Company&apos;s monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the Treaty
			<lb />
			of Utrecht, signed in 1713 as a settlement following the War of
			<lb />
			Spanish Succession. Investors in the UK were promised high
			<lb />
			returns of unimaginable proportions, which led to the shares of the
			<lb />
			company being traded by avaricious investors at high premium. By
			<lb />
			1717, the South Sea Company became so wealthy despite having
			<lb />
			done no real business that it assumed the public debt of the UK
			<lb />
			government. This was the first speculative bubble that the country
			<lb />
			(or perhaps the world) saw, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had
			<lb />
			&quot;burst&quot;, leading to bankruptcies and the passage of The Bubble Act,
			<lb />
			1720.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.4
			<lb />
			The UK Bubble Act, 1720 prohibited the establishment of
			<lb />
			companies without a Royal Charter and it remained in force until
			<lb />
			its repeal in 1825. By 1825, Industrial Revolution had gathered
			<lb />
			pace, necessitating a legal change. The Bubble Companies Act 1825
			<lb />
			lifted the restrictions, but it did not resolve the problem fully.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.5
			<lb />
			Therefore in 1843, the Parliamentary Committee on Joint
			<lb />
			Stock Companies, chaired by William Gladstone made a report,
			<lb />
			which led to the enactment of the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844.
			<lb />
			This Act made it possible for ordinary people to incorporate
			<lb />
			companies through a simple registration procedure. However, it did
			<lb />
			not permit limited liability.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.6
			<lb />
			Then came the Limited Liability Act, 1855, which allowed
			<lb />
			investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure, to
			<lb />
			the amount they invested in the company. These two features a
			<lb />
			simple registration procedure and limited liability were
			<lb />
			subsequently codified in the first modern company law enactment,
			<lb />
			namely the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856. The Joint Stock
			<lb />
			companies Act, 1856 made it possible for any 7 individuals,
			<lb />
			subscribing to shares individually, to form a limited liability
			<lb />
			company. This was subsequently consolidated with a number of
			<lb />
			other statutes in the Companies Act 1862, which was described by
			<lb />
			Francis Palmer as the Magna Carta of Cooperative enterprises.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.7
			<lb />
			The Companies Act, 1862 consolidated the laws relating
			<lb />
			to the incorporation, regulation and winding up of trading
			<lb />
			companies and other associations. Though this Act did not provide
			<lb />
			for any remedies to the minority shareholders in respect of
			<lb />
			oppression and mismanagement, Section 79 empowered the Court
			<lb />
			to wind up a company whenever the Court was of the opinion that it
			<lb />
			is just and equitable to wind up the company. This Act also
			<lb />
			contained a provision conferring a limited right upon a dissentient
			<lb />
			member, whenever a sale or transfer of the business or property of
			<lb />
			the company took place in the course of winding up proceedings.
			<lb />
			15.8
			<lb />
			However, when fraudulent practices in relation to the
			<lb />
			formation and management of companies came to the fore, an
			<lb />
			investigation was ordered by a Committee chaired by Lord Davey.
			<lb />
			The Committee submitted a report along with a draft Bill in June,
			<lb />
			1895. This Bill became the Companies Act, 1900. This Act also did
			<lb />
			not contain any provision relating to oppression and
			<lb />
			mismanagement. So was the case with the Companies
			<lb />
			(Consolidation) Act, 1908. The Act of 1908 was examined by a
			<lb />
			committee presided over by Lord Wrenbury in 1918 and again by a
			<lb />
			committee headed by Greene, K.G. in 1926, which led to the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 1929.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			During the second world war, a Company Law Reforms
			<lb />
			Committee chaired by Lord Cohen was appointed (in 1943) by the
			<lb />
			President of the Board of Trade to consider and report what major
			<lb />
			amendments are needed to the 1929 Act, particularly &quot;to review the
			<lb />
			requirements prescribed in regard to the formation and affairs of
			<lb />
			companies and the safeguards afforded for investors and for the
			<lb />
			public interest&quot;. This Committee&apos;s report dealt specifically with 2
			<lb />
			problems, namely (i) the hardship caused to the legal heirs of a
			<lb />
			deceased shareholder of a private company in the matter of disposal
			<lb />
			of the shares, due to the restriction on the transferability of shares
			<lb />
			and (ii) the abuse of office by the Directors in siphoning off huge
			<lb />
			profits in the form of remuneration, to the detriment of the small
			<lb />
			shareholders. After analyzing these 2 issues in paragraphs 58 and
			<lb />
			59 as illustrative cases, the Cohen Committee, recommended that
			<lb />
			&quot;a step in the right direction would be to enlarge the power of the
			<lb />
			Court to make a windingup order by providing that the power shall
			<lb />
			be exercisable notwithstanding the existence of an alternative
			<lb />
			remedy&quot;.
			<lb />
			Paragraphs 58 to 60 of the Report reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			58. Restrictions on transfer of shares. It has been
			<lb />
			represented to us that the provisions which are inserted in
			<lb />
			the articles of a private company for the restriction of the
			<lb />
			transfer of the shares have caused hardship especially
			<lb />
			where the legal representatives of minority shareholders
			<lb />
			have to raise money to pay estate duties. The directors of the
			<lb />
			company, who are usually the principal shareholders,
			<lb />
			sometimes exercise their power to refuse to register transfers
			<lb />
			to outsiders, with the result that executors, who must realise
			<lb />
			their testators&apos; shares in order to pay estate duty, have to
			<lb />
			sell to the directors or persons approved by them at prices
			<lb />
			much lower than the values at which the shares are
			<lb />
			assessed by the Board of Inland Revenue in valuing the
			<lb />
			estate of the deceased for purpose of estate duty. This
			<lb />
			difficulty is not in law peculiar to private companies since
			<lb />
			there is no legal impediment to a public company having in
			<lb />
			its articles a provision subjecting transfer of shares to the
			<lb />
			approval of the directors though Stock Exchanges do not
			<lb />
			accept it where leave to deal is required. This restriction is
			<lb />
			valued as a means of keeping a family business under the
			<lb />
			control of the family and we see no sufficient reason for its
			<lb />
			removal, particularly if our suggestion in paragraph 6o is
			<lb />
			adopted.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			59. Excessive remuneration of directors. Another abuse
			<lb />
			which has been found to occur is that the directors absorb
			<lb />
			an undue proportion of the profits of the company in
			<lb />
			remuneration for their services so that little or nothing is left
			<lb />
			for distribution among the shareholders by way of dividend.
			<lb />
			This may happen where, for example, two persons trading in
			<lb />
			partnership form their business into a limited company and
			<lb />
			one partner dies, leaving his shares to his widow who takes
			<lb />
			no active part in the business. At present the only remedy
			<lb />
			open to the minority shareholder is to commence an action to
			<lb />
			restrain the company from paying the remuneration on the
			<lb />
			ground that such payment is a fraud on the minority, since
			<lb />
			the Court would not make a windingup, order in view of the
			<lb />
			alternative remedy.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			60. Oppression of minorities.We have carefully examined
			<lb />
			suggestions
			<lb />
			intended
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			strengthen
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			minority
			<lb />
			shareholders of a private company in resisting oppression by
			<lb />
			the majority. The difficulties to which we have referred in the
			<lb />
			two preceding paragraphs are, in fact, only illustrations of a
			<lb />
			general problem. It is impossible to frame a recommendation
			<lb />
			to cover every case. We consider that a step in the right
			<lb />
			direction would be to enlarge the power of the Court to make
			<lb />
			a windingup order by providing that the power shall be
			<lb />
			exercisable notwithstanding the existence of an alternative
			<lb />
			remedy. In many cases, however, the windingup of the
			<lb />
			company will not benefit the minority shareholders, since the
			<lb />
			breakup value of the assets may be small, or the only
			<lb />
			available purchaser may be that very majority whose
			<lb />
			oppression has driven the minority to seek redress. We,
			<lb />
			therefore, suggest that the Court should have, in addition,
			<lb />
			the power to impose upon the parties to a dispute whatever
			<lb />
			settlement the Court considers just and equitable. This
			<lb />
			discretion must be unfettered, for it is impossible to lay down
			<lb />
			a general guide to the solution of what are essentially
			<lb />
			individual cases. We do not think that the Court can be
			<lb />
			expected in every case to find and impose a solution; but our
			<lb />
			proposal will give the Court a jurisdiction which it at present
			<lb />
			lacks, and thereby at least empower it to impose a solution
			<lb />
			in those cases where one exists.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			15.10
			<lb />
			Ultimately, in para 153 of the report, a recommendation
			<lb />
			was made to amend the provision relating to winding up, by adding
			<lb />
			the following:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			There be a new section under which, on a shareholder&apos;s
			<lb />
			petition, the Court, if satisfied that a minority of the
			<lb />
			shareholders is being oppressed and that a windingup order
			<lb />
			would not do justice to the minority, should be empowered,
			<lb />
			instead of making a windingup order, to make such other
			<lb />
			order, including an order for the purchase by the majority of
			<lb />
			the shares of the minority at a price to be fixed by the Court,
			<lb />
			as to the Court may seem just
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			15.11
			<lb />
			Lord Cohen committee report led to the enactment of the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 1948, in which a provision was incorporated in
			<lb />
			section 210. The heading given to the Section was, &quot;Alternative
			<lb />
			Remedy to Winding up in Cases of Oppression&quot;. This provision reads
			<lb />
			as follows:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;210. Alternative remedy to winding up in cases of
			<lb />
			oppression
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(1) Any member of a company who complains that the affairs of
			<lb />
			the company are being conducted in a manner oppressive to
			<lb />
			some part of the members (including himself) or, in a case
			<lb />
			falling within subsection (3) of section one hundred and sixty
			<lb />
			nine of this Act, the Board of Trade, may make an application
			<lb />
			to the court by petition for an order under this section.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) If on any such petition the court is of opinion-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) that the company&apos;s affairs are being conducted as
			<lb />
			aforesaid; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) that to wind up the company would unfairly prejudice that
			<lb />
			part of the members, but otherwise the facts would justify the
			<lb />
			making of a windingup order on the ground that it was just
			<lb />
			and equitable that the company should be wound up;
			<lb />
			the court may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters
			<lb />
			complained of, make such order as it thinks fit, whether for
			<lb />
			regulating the conduct of the company&apos;s affairs in future, or for
			<lb />
			the purchase of the shares of any members of the company by
			<lb />
			other members of the company or by the company and, in the
			<lb />
			case of a purchase by the company, for the reduction
			<lb />
			accordingly of the company&apos;s capital, or otherwise.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) Where an order under this section makes any alteration in
			<lb />
			or addition to any company&apos;s memorandum or articles, then,
			<lb />
			notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Act but
			<lb />
			subject to the provisions of the order, the company concerned
			<lb />
			shall not have power without the leave of the court to make
			<lb />
			any further alteration in or addition to the memorandum or
			<lb />
			articles inconsistent with the provisions of the order; but,
			<lb />
			subject to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the
			<lb />
			alterations or additions made by the order shall be of the same
			<lb />
			effect as if duly made by resolution of the company and the
			<lb />
			provisions of this Act shall apply to the memorandum or
			<lb />
			articles as so altered or added to accordingly.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(4) An office copy of any order under this section altering or
			<lb />
			adding to, or giving leave to alter or add to, a company&apos;s
			<lb />
			memorandum or articles shall, within fourteen days after the
			<lb />
			making thereof, be delivered by the company to the registrar of
			<lb />
			companies for registration; and if a company makes default in
			<lb />
			complying with this subsection, the company and every officer
			<lb />
			of the company who is in default shall be liable to a default
			<lb />
			fine.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(5) In relation to a petition under this section, section three
			<lb />
			hundred and sixtyfive of this Act shall apply as it applies in
			<lb />
			relation to a windingup petition, and proceedings under this
			<lb />
			section shall, for the purposes of Part V of the Economy
			<lb />
			(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1926, be deemed to be
			<lb />
			proceedings under this Act in relation to the winding up of
			<lb />
			companies.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			15.12
			<lb />
			But the word &quot;oppressive&quot; appearing in section 210 of the
			<lb />
			1948 Act, was construed by the House of Lords in Scottish
			<lb />
			Cooperative
			<lb />
			Wholesale
			<lb />
			Society
			<lb />
			vs.
			<lb />
			Meyer 1
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			mean
			<lb />
			&quot;burdensome, harsh and wrongful&quot;. The expression &quot;wrongful&quot;
			<lb />
			gave rise to some uncertainty as to whether it required actual
			<lb />
			illegality or invasion of legal rights. Moreover, the provision invited 2
			<lb />
			criticisms namely (i) that the requirement to establish grounds
			<lb />
			which justified winding up under the just and equitable clause was
			<lb />
			itself harsh and (ii) that section 210 would not apply to an isolated
			<lb />
			act, but applied only to a course of conduct.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.13
			<lb />
			Therefore, the Jenkins Committee of 1962 recommended
			<lb />
			use of the term &quot;unfairly prejudicial&quot;. Parliament adopted it in
			<lb />
			Section 75 of the Companies Act, 1980. Later, this section 75 of the
			<lb />
			1980 Act became, with an amendment, Section 459 of the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 1985. Sections 459 to 461 of the Companies Act,
			<lb />
			1985 were included in Part XVII, under the caption &quot;Protection of
			<lb />
			Company&apos;s Members against Unfair Prejudice&quot;. Sections 459 to
			<lb />
			461 read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			459. Order on application of company member.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(1) A member of a company may apply to the court by petition
			<lb />
			for an order under this Part on the ground that the company&apos;s
			<lb />
			affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner which
			<lb />
			is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of some part of the
			<lb />
			members (including at least himself) or that any actual or
			<lb />
			proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or
			<lb />
			omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) The provisions of this Part apply to a person who is not a
			<lb />
			member of a company but to whom shares in the company
			<lb />
			have been transferred or transmitted by operation of law, as
			<lb />
			those provisions apply to a member of the company; and
			<lb />
			references to a member or members are to be construed
			<lb />
			accordingly.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			460 Order on application of Secretary of State
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(1) If in the case of any company-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) the Secretary of State has received a report under section
			<lb />
			437, or exercised his powers under section 447 or 448 of this
			<lb />
			Act or section 44(2) to (6) of the [1982 c. 50.] Insurance
			<lb />
			Companies Act 1982 (inspection of company&apos;s books and
			<lb />
			papers), and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) it appears to him that the company&apos;s affairs are being or
			<lb />
			have been conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial
			<lb />
			to the interests of some part of the members, or that any actual
			<lb />
			or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or
			<lb />
			omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial. he may
			<lb />
			himself (in addition to or instead of presenting a petition under
			<lb />
			section 440 for the winding up of the company) apply to the
			<lb />
			court by petition for an order under this Part.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) In this section (and, so far as applicable for its purposes, in
			<lb />
			the section next following) &quot;company&quot; means any body
			<lb />
			corporate which is liable to be wound up under this Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			461 Provisions as to petitions and orders under this Part
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(1) If the court is satisfied that a petition under this Part is well
			<lb />
			founded, it may make such order as it thinks fit for giving relief
			<lb />

			(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the
			<lb />
			court&apos;s order may-

			(a) regulate the conduct of the company&apos;s affairs in the future,
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) require the company to refrain from doing or continuing an
			<lb />
			act complained of by the petitioner or to do an act which the
			<lb />
			petitioner has complained it has omitted to do,
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) authorise civil proceedings to be brought in the name and on
			<lb />
			behalf of the company by such person or persons and on such
			<lb />
			terms as the court may direct,
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d) provide for the purchase of the shares of any members of
			<lb />
			the company by other members or by the company itself and,
			<lb />
			in the case of a purchase by the company itself, the reduction

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) If an order under this Part requires the company not to
			<lb />
			make any, or any specified, alteration in the memorandum or
			<lb />
			articles, the company does not then have power without leave
			<lb />
			of the court to make any such alteration in breach of that
			<lb />
			requirement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(4) Any alteration in the company&apos;s memorandum or articles
			<lb />
			made by virtue of an order under this Part is of the same effect
			<lb />
			as if duly made by resolution of the company, and the
			<lb />
			provisions of this Act apply to the memorandum or articles as
			<lb />
			so altered accordingly.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(5) An office copy of an order under this Part altering, or giving
			<lb />
			leave to alter, a company&apos;s memorandum or articles shall,
			<lb />
			within 14 days from the making of the order or such longer
			<lb />
			period as the court may allow, be delivered by the company to
			<lb />
			the registrar of companies for registration ; and if a company
			<lb />
			makes default in complying with this subsection, the company
			<lb />
			and every officer of it who is in default is liable to a fine and,
			<lb />
			for continued contravention, to a daily default fine.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(6) Section 663 (windingup rules) applies in relation to a
			<lb />
			petition under this Part as in relation to a windingup petition.
			<lb />
			The words in bold letters in the above extract in section 459,
			<lb />
			were later substituted by the words &quot;unfairly prejudicial to the
			<lb />
			interests of its members generally or of some part of its
			<lb />
			members&quot; by a 1989 amendment which came into effect in 1991.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			15.14
			<lb />
			The Companies Act, 1985 was repealed by the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 2006, which had the dubious distinction of being
			<lb />
			the longest Act in British parliamentary history, with 1300 sections
			<lb />
			and 16 schedules. (until it was overtaken by the Corporation Tax
			<lb />
			Act, 2009). Part 30 of the Act contains 3 provisions in sections 994
			<lb />
			to 996 (apart from others), grouped under the heading &quot;Protection of
			<lb />
			Members against Unfair Prejudice&quot;. Paragraph 1265 of the
			<lb />
			Explanatory Notes to the 2006 Act, confirms that Sections 994998
			<lb />
			restate sections 459, 460 and 461 of the 1985 Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.15

			<lb />
			(b) that an actual or proposed act or omission of the

		<head>
			Legislative history in India
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			15.16
			<lb />
			In India, the earliest legislation made for the &apos;Regulation
			<lb />
			of Registered Joint Stock Companies&apos; was Act No. XLIII of 1850.
			<lb />
			This Act provided for the registration of every unincorporated
			<lb />
			company of partners, associated under a deed containing a
			<lb />
			provision that the shares in the stock or business of the said
			<lb />
			company, are transferable without the consent of all the partners. It
			<lb />
			will be fascinating for those interested in history, to know that
			<lb />
			under this 1850 Act, the Supreme Courts of Judicature at
			<lb />
			Calcutta, Madras and Bombay were conferred not only with the
			<lb />
			power of registration of such companies but also with a power to
			<lb />
			enforce the performance by the directors of any of their duties
			<lb />
			under the Act or the deed of partnership. These courts also had a
			<lb />
			consequential power to punish a person for contempt, if there was
			<lb />
			any disobedience of the order of the court. The concepts such as
			<lb />
			minority, majority, oppression, mismanagement etc., were alien to
			<lb />
			this Act of 1850.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.17
			<lb />
			Then came Act No.XIX of 1857 which provided for the
			<lb />
			incorporation and regulation of joint stock companies and other
			<lb />
			associations either with or without limited liability of the members
			<lb />
			thereof. The primary object of the Act was to enable the members of
			<lb />
			the joint stock companies and other associations to limit their
			<lb />
			liability for the debts and engagements relating to those companies
			<lb />
			and associations. It was under this Act that for the first time the
			<lb />
			prescription that 7 or more persons associated for any lawful
			<lb />
			purpose may form themselves into an incorporated company with
			<lb />
			or without limited liability by subscribing their names to a
			<lb />
			Memorandum of Association, was introduced. By this very same Act
			<lb />
			the prohibition for 20 or more persons to carry on any partnership
			<lb />
			in trade or business having gain as its object, unless they are
			<lb />
			registered as a company, was also introduced. But even in this Act
			<lb />
			the concepts such as oppression and mismanagement etc., were not
			<lb />
			dealt with (perhaps due to the fact that East India Company alone
			<lb />
			was granted such a privilege).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.18
			<lb />
			Thereafter, a fullfledged enactment known as The Indian
			<lb />
			Companies&apos; Act, 1866 was passed with a view to consolidate and
			<lb />
			amend the laws relating to the incorporation, regulation and
			<lb />
			winding up of trading companies and other associations. Even this
			<lb />
			Act, did not provide for any remedy in the case of oppression and
			<lb />
			mismanagement, though provisions were made for winding up
			<lb />
			including voluntary winding up.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.19
			<lb />
			The above Act No. X of 1866 was repealed by The Indian
			<lb />
			Companies Act No. VI of 1882. This Act also did not contain
			<lb />
			provisions for an individual or group of shareholders/members to
			<lb />
			seek redressal against oppression, mismanagement or any unfair
			<lb />
			prejudicial treatment.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.20
			<lb />
			Then came The Indian Companies Act, 1913 (Act No.VII
			<lb />
			of 1913) which repealed the 1882 Act and the amendments made
			<lb />
			thereof. Interestingly, this 1913 Act also repealed one particular
			<lb />
			provision in the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899. Though in the original
			<lb />
			enactment of 1913, there was no provision relating to oppression
			<lb />
			and mismanagement, the Amendment Act 52 of 1951 inserted
			<lb />
			Section 153C to The Indian Companies Act, 1913. This Section
			<lb />
			153C reads as follows :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;153C. Power of court to act when company acts in a

			15.21
			<lb />
			After the country attained independence, a Company Law
			<lb />
			Committee was appointed by the Government of India for the
			<lb />
			revision of the Companies Act with particular reference to Indian
			<lb />
			trade and industry. The Committee submitted its report in March
			<lb />
			1952. After circulating the Report to all State Governments,
			<lb />
			Chambers of Commerce, Trade Associations and other bodies and
			<lb />
			after examining the inputs received, the Companies Act, 1956 (Act
			<lb />
			no.1 of 1956) was passed. This Act included a full Chapter in
			<lb />
			Chapter VI of Part VI, containing elaborate provisions for the
			<lb />
			prevention of oppression and mismanagement. This Chapter was
			<lb />
			divided into two parts, with Part A dealing with the powers of the
			<lb />
			Court/Tribunal and Part B dealing with the powers of the Central
			<lb />
			Government. Sections 397, 398 and 402 of the Act are of
			<lb />
			significance and, hence, they are extracted as follows:

			<lb />
			manner oppressive to any member or members (including any
			<lb />
			one or more of themselves) may apply to the Court for an
			<lb />
			order under this section, provided such members have a right
			<lb />
			so to apply in virtue of section 399.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) If, on any application under subsection (1), the Court is
			<lb />
			of opinion
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a)
			<lb />
			that the company&apos;s affairs are being conducted in
			<lb />
			a manner oppressive to any member or members; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			that to wind up the company would unfairly
			<lb />
			prejudice such member or members, but that otherwise
			<lb />
			the facts would justify the making of a winding up
			<lb />
			order on the ground that it was just and equitable that
			<lb />
			the company should be wound up;
			<lb />
			the Court may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters
			<lb />
			complained of, make such order as it thinks fit.

			shareholders, of the company) has taken place in the
			<lb />
			management or control of the company, whether by an
			<lb />
			alteration in its board of Directors, or of its managing
			<lb />
			agent or secretaries and treasurers, or in the
			<lb />
			constitution or control of the firm or body corporate
			<lb />
			acting as its managing agent or secretaries and
			<lb />
			treasurers, or in the ownership of the company&apos;s
			<lb />
			shares, or if it has no share capital, in its membership,
			<lb />
			or in any other manner whatsoever, and that by reason
			<lb />
			of such change, it is likely that the affairs of the
			<lb />
			company will be conducted in a manner prejudicial to
			<lb />
			the interests of the company;
			<lb />
			may apply to the Court for an order under this section,
			<lb />
			provided such members have a right so to apply in virtue of
			<lb />
			section 399.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2)
			<lb />
			If, on any application under subsection (1), the Court is
			<lb />
			of opinion that the affairs of the company are being conducted
			<lb />
			as aforesaid or that by reason of any material change as
			<lb />
			aforesaid in the management or control of the company, it is
			<lb />
			likely that the affairs of the company will be conducted as
			<lb />
			aforesaid, the Court may, with a view to bringing to an end or

			preventing the matters complained of or apprehended, make
			<lb />
			such order as it thinks fit.

			<lb />
			except after due notice to the party concerned and

			provided further that no such agreement shall be
			<lb />
			modified except after obtaining the consent of the party
			<lb />
			concerned;

			within three months before the date of the application
			<lb />
			under section 397 or 398, which would, if made or done

			15.22
			<lb />
			After the economy of the country opened up and the
			<lb />
			national and international economic environment changed, the
			<lb />
			Government decided to replace the 1956 Act with a new one.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the Companies Bill, 2009 was introduced in the Lok
			<lb />
			Sabha. But this bill was withdrawn and the Companies Bill, 2011
			<lb />
			was introduced. This eventually became the Companies Act 2013.
			<lb />
			Among the many changes brought about by this Companies Act
			<lb />
			2013, those relating to protection of minority shareholders is what
			<lb />
			is relevant for our purpose. In fact, paragraph 5(ix) of the Statement
			<lb />
			of Objects and Reasons for the Companies Act, 2013 deals with the
			<lb />
			issue of protection of minority shareholders. It reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5. (ix) Protection for Minority Shareholders:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a)
			<lb />
			Exit option to shareholders in case of dissent to
			<lb />
			change in object for which public issue was made.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			Specific disclosure regarding effect of merger on
			<lb />
			creditors, key managerial personnel, promoters and
			<lb />
			nonpromoter shareholders is being provided.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			Tribunal is being empowered to provide for exit offer to
			<lb />
			dissenting shareholders in case of compromise or
			<lb />
			arrangement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c)
			<lb />
			The Board may have a director representing
			<lb />
			small shareholders who may be elected in such manner
			<lb />
			as may be prescribed by rules.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			15.23
			<lb />
			Chapter XVI of the 2013 Act containing Sections 241 to
			<lb />
			246 deals exclusively with &quot;Prevention of Oppression and
			<lb />
			Mismanagement.&quot; Sections 241 and 242 are of relevance for our
			<lb />
			purpose and hence it is extracted as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;241. Application to Tribunal for relief in cases of
			<lb />
			oppression, etc. -(1) Any member of a company who complains
			<lb />
			that-
			<lb />
		</item>

			<lb />
			conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest or
			<lb />
			in a manner prejudicial or oppressive to him or any
			<lb />
			other member or members or in a manner prejudicial to
			<lb />
			the interests of the company; or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			the material change, not being a change brought
			<lb />
			about by, or in the interests of, any creditors, including
			<lb />
			debenture holders or any class of shareholders of the
			<lb />
			company, has taken place in the management or control
			<lb />
			of the company, whether by an alteration in the Board
			<lb />
			of Directors, or manager, or in the ownership of the
			<lb />
			company&apos;s shares, or if it has no share capital, in its
			<lb />
			membership, or in any other manner whatsoever, and
			<lb />
			that by reason of such change, it is likely that the
			<lb />
			affairs of the company will be conducted in a manner
			<lb />
			prejudicial to its interests or its members or any class of
			<lb />
			members,
			<lb />
			may apply to the Tribunal, provided such member has a right
			<lb />
			to apply under section 244, for an order under this Chapter.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) The Central Government, if it is of the opinion that
			<lb />

		<p>
			15.24
			<lb />
			Thus the English legislative history of the provisions
			<lb />
			relating to oppression, mismanagement and prejudice, show 3
			<lb />
			milestones, namely (i) the introduction in the year 1862, of
			<lb />
			the &apos;just and equitable clause&apos; for winding up and the
			<lb />
			conferment of a limited right on the dissentient member,
			<lb />
			whenever a transfer or sale took place in the course of
			<lb />
			winding up proceedings, (ii) the provision of an alternative
			<lb />
			remedy to winding up, in case of oppression of minority, in
			<lb />
			the year 1948 and (iii) the shift from oppression to the &apos;unfair
			<lb />
			prejudice&apos; quotient in 1980/1985. The journey, in other words,
			<lb />
			was from &quot;winding up on just and equitable cause&quot; to
			<lb />
			&quot;oppression&quot; to &quot;unfair prejudice&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.25
			<lb />
			But in so far as India is concerned, what was
			<lb />
			incorporated in section 210 of the English Companies Act, 1948,
			<lb />
			inspired the insertion of section 153C of the Indian Companies Act,
			<lb />
			1913, by way of an amendment in 1951. Then came sections 397
			<lb />
			and 398 of the 1956 Act, with certain modifications. An overhaul of
			<lb />
			these provisions resulted in Sections 241 and 242 of the 2013
			<lb />
			Indian Act, on the model of (and not exact reproduction of) sections
			<lb />
			459 to 461 of the English Companies Act, 1985 and sections 994 to
			<lb />
			996 of the English Act of 2006.

			<lb />
			The change of language and the consequential change of
			<lb />
			parameters for an inquiry relating to oppression and
			<lb />
			mismanagement from 1951 to 1956 and from 1956 to 2013 and
			<lb />
			thereafter can be best understood, if the anatomy of the statutory
			<lb />
			provisions are dissected and presented in a table :

			<lb />
			From the table given above, it could be seen that the
			<lb />
			changes brought about in India in course of time, were material.
			<lb />
			These changes can be summarised as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(i) While the conduct of the company&apos;s affairs in a manner that
			<lb />
			warrant interference, should be &quot;present and continuing&quot;, under
			<lb />
			the 1913 Act and 1956 Act, as seen from the usage of the words
			<lb />
			&quot;are being&quot;, the conduct could even be &quot;past or present and
			<lb />
			continuous&quot; under the 2013 Act as seen from the usage of the
			<lb />
			words &quot;have been or are being&quot; (But the conduct cannot be of a
			<lb />
			distant past);
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) Prejudice to public interest and prejudice to the interests of any
			<lb />
			member or members were not among the parameters prescribed in
			<lb />
			the 1913 Act, but under the 1956 Act prejudice to public interest
			<lb />
			was included both under the provision relating to oppression and
			<lb />
			also under the provision relating to mismanagement. Prejudice to
			<lb />
			the interest of the company was included only in the provision
			<lb />
			relating to mismanagement. But under the 2013 Act conduct
			<lb />
			prejudicial to any member or prejudicial to public interest or
			<lb />
			prejudicial to the interest of the company are all added along with
			<lb />
			oppression;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iii) Under the 1913 Act, the Court should be satisfied that winding
			<lb />
			up under the just and equitable clause will not only unfairly
			<lb />
			prejudice but &quot;also materially prejudice&quot; the interests of the
			<lb />
			company or any part of its members. But in the 1956 Act and 2013
			<lb />
			Act, the words &quot;and materially&quot; do not follow the word &quot;unfairly&quot;.
			<lb />
			Moreover, under the 1956 Act and 2013 Act all that is required to
			<lb />
			be seen is whether the winding up will unfairly prejudice &quot;such
			<lb />
			member or members&quot; indicating thereby that the focus was on
			<lb />
			complaining/affected members.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.28
			<lb />
			Having thus seen the shift in the Indian legislative policy
			<lb />
			under Act 52 of 1951 (amending the 1913 Act) and then under the
			<lb />
			1956 Act as amended by Act 53 of 1963 and thereafter under the
			<lb />
			2013 Act, let us also see how the shift in the legislative policy
			<lb />
			happened in the United Kingdom. A table similar to the one given in
			<lb />
			para 15.26, is presented below insofar as the English Law is
			<lb />
			concerned:

		<p>
			15.29
			<lb />
			There are a few notable features of the shift that
			<lb />
			happened in England. They are (i) from a &quot;conduct oppressive to
			<lb />
			some part of the members&quot; the focus has shifted to &quot;conduct unfairly
			<lb />
			prejudicial to the interests of the members generally or of some part
			<lb />
			of its members&quot;: (ii) conduct prejudicial to public interest or
			<lb />
			prejudicial to the company&apos;s interest, does not form part of the
			<lb />
			scheme of English Law; (iii) any actual or proposed act or omission,
			<lb />
			can also be challenged under English Law on the ground that it
			<lb />
			would turn out to be prejudicial; (iv) the question of the Court
			<lb />
			forming an opinion that the facts would otherwise require an order
			<lb />
			for winding up on just and equitable ground but that the same will
			<lb />
			unfairly prejudice the complaining members, does not arise under
			<lb />
			the English Law any more.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.30
			<lb />
			But despite the huge shift in England, there appears to
			<lb />
			be a common thread running in all the enactments, both in India
			<lb />
			and England. In all the 3 Indian enactments, namely the 1913 Act,
			<lb />
			1956 Act and the 2013 Act, the Court is ordained, generally to pass
			<lb />
			such orders &quot;with a view to bringing to an end the matters
			<lb />
			complained of&quot;. This sentence is found in Section 153C(4) of the
			<lb />
			1913 Act. It is found in Section 397(2) as well as 398(2) of the 1956
			<lb />
			Act and it is also found in Section 242 (1) of the 2013 Act. This is
			<lb />
			also the common thread that runs through the statutory
			<lb />
			prescriptions contained in the English Acts of 1948, 1985 and
			<lb />
			2006. Therefore, at the stage of granting relief in an application
			<lb />
			under these provisions, the final question that the Court should ask
			<lb />
			itself is as to whether the order to be passed will bring to an end the
			<lb />
			matters complained of. Having thus seen the development of law, let
			<lb />
			us now take up the questions of law one after another.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			16. Question No. 1
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			16.1
			<lb />
			The first question of law arising for consideration is
			<lb />
			whether the formation of opinion by the Appellate Tribunal that the
			<lb />
			company&apos;s affairs have been or are being conducted in a manner
			<lb />
			prejudicial and oppressive to some members and that the facts
			<lb />
			otherwise justify the winding up of the company on just and
			<lb />
			equitable ground, is in tune with the well settled principles and
			<lb />
			parameters, especially in the light of the fact that the findings of
			<lb />
			NCLT on facts were not individually and specifically overturned by
			<lb />
			the Appellate Tribunal ?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			16.2
			<lb />
			An analysis of the provisions of Section 241(1)(a) read
			<lb />
			with clauses (a) and (b) of Subsection (1) of Section 242 shows that
			<lb />
			a relief under these provisions can be granted only if the Tribunal is
			<lb />
			of the opinion -
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;(1) that the company&apos;s affairs have been or are being
			<lb />
			conducted in a manner -
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) Prejudicial to any member or members or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) Prejudicial to public interest or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) Prejudicial to the interests of the company or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d) Oppressive to any member or members
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			(2) that though the facts would justify the making of a
			<lb />
			winding up order on the basis of just and equitable clause,
			<lb />
			such a winding up would unfairly prejudice such member or
			<lb />
			members.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			16.3
			<lb />
			Keeping in mind the above statutory prescription, if we go
			<lb />
			back to the pleadings, it will be seen that the complainant
			<lb />
			companies forming part of the S.P. Group pitched their claim in
			<lb />
			their original petition on the ground:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(i) that the affairs of Tata Sons are being carried as though
			<lb />
			it was the proprietary concern of RNT; and
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) that though the oppressive conduct of the respondents
			<lb />
			was such that it would be just and equitable to wind up Tata
			<lb />
			Sons under Section 241, but such winding up would unfairly
			<lb />
			prejudice the interests of the complainants.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.4
			<lb />
			The specific allegations on which the complainant
			<lb />
			companies (of the S.P. Group) sought relief are as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The abuse of a few Articles of Association and the control
			<lb />
			exercised by the Tata Trust and its nominee Directors over the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors of Tata Sons;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The removal of CPM as Executive Chairman;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Transactions with Mr. C. Sivasankaran of Sterling
			<lb />
			Infotech and the transactions in which Tata Teleservices got
			<lb />
			entangled;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) Acquisition of Corus Group Inc of U.K.;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) Doomed Nano Car project;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) The grant of intercorporate bridge loan to sterling
			<lb />
			computers;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) The dealings with NTT DoCoMo which eventually led to
			<lb />
			an arbitration award for a huge sum of money;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii)
			<lb />
			The sale of a flat to Mehli Mistry and the grant of huge
			<lb />
			personal favours to the companies owned and controlled by
			<lb />
			Mehli Mistry.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			16.5
			<lb />
			Each and every one of the allegations forming the basis of
			<lb />
			the complaint, was dealt with by NCLT and categorical findings
			<lb />
			based on evidence was recorded by NCLT. The findings recorded by
			<lb />
			NCLT allegationwise, are indicated in paragraph 6.1 above.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.6
			<lb />
			None of the above findings, except the one relating to the
			<lb />
			removal of CPM was specifically and individually overturned by
			<lb />
			NCLAT. In addition NCLAT focused on the conversion of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			from a public company to a private company.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.7
			<lb />
			For easy appreciation, we present in the following table,
			<lb />
			the allegations made in the complaint, the findings recorded by
			<lb />
			NCLT with an indication whether NCLAT dealt with the same or not:

			exit from TTSL in lieu of the
			<lb />
			financial strain it was facing.
			<lb />
			On 08.10.2013, RNT wrote to

			DSL
			<lb />

			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			Siva Group
			<lb />
			the Tata Group Companies
			<lb />
			(Kalimati) to Siva Company
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			paid
			<lb />
			back
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			undertaking given by the
			<lb />
			company was released. Siva
			<lb />
			himself provided personal
			<lb />
			guarantee for the loan taken
			<lb />
			from Standard Chartered
			<lb />
			Bank. Moreover, no Tata
			<lb />
			Group company paid any
			<lb />
			money for acquisition of
			<lb />
			TTSL shares by Siva Group.
			<lb />
			(Para 228)
			<lb />
			3. Ultimately, Siva had to pay
			<lb />
			its group pro-rata share of
			<lb />
			the Docomo award. Siva, on
			<lb />
			19.09.2016,
			<lb />
			then
			<lb />

			of TTSL, for the ensuing
			<lb />
			losses
			<lb />
			incurred
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			it.
			<lb />
			However, this did not prove

			any special relationship with
			<lb />
			RNT.(Para
			<lb />
			221,
			<lb />
			230,
			<lb />
			233,234)
			<lb />
			4. Acquisition price of TTSL
			<lb />
			by both Siva and Temasek
			<lb />
			had unanimous approval of
			<lb />
			the shareholders. (Para 230)
			<lb />

			<lb />
			and connected parties. (Para

			difference in the acquisition
			<lb />
			prices
			<lb />
			between
			<lb />
			Temasek
			<lb />
			(Rs.26/ share) and Siva
			<lb />
			Group
			<lb />
			(Rs.17/share)
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			owing to more shareholding
			<lb />
			rights with Temasek. (Para
			<lb />
			230)
			<lb />
			7. CPM made more profits
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			acquisition
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			shares of TTSL than Siva
			<lb />
			Group. (the latter had sold its
			<lb />
			shares to NTT-Docomo in
			<lb />
			2008).
			<lb />
			Complainant
			<lb />
			companies
			<lb />
			also
			<lb />
			acquired
			<lb />
			shares of Tata Teleservices
			<lb />
			Ltd. at Rs. 15/ per share.
			<lb />
			(Para 230)
			<lb />
			8.
			<lb />
			NTT-DoCoMo
			<lb />
			also
			<lb />
			acquired shares from brother
			<lb />
			and father of CPM. CPM was
			<lb />
			also a beneficiary like Siva
			<lb />
			but this was not disclosed by
			<lb />
			the complainant companies.
			<lb />
			The rate at which the
			<lb />
			petitioners
			<lb />
			acquired
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			shares of TTSL is less than
			<lb />
			the rate at which Siva
			<lb />
			acquired them and the gain
			<lb />
			made by the petitioners by
			<lb />
			selling
			<lb />
			shares
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			NTT
			<lb />
			DoCoMo was more than the
			<lb />
			gain made by the Siva Group.
			<lb />
			(Para 230)
			<lb />
			9. The acquisition happened
			<lb />
			in 2006 and it is sought to
			<lb />
			raise after 10 years, during
			<lb />
			which period CPM was part
			<lb />
			of that board and also the
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman for a
			<lb />
			period.
			<lb />
			10. No proof on record to
			<lb />
			show leakage of info
			<lb />
			11. It was Mr. Nitin Nohria
			<lb />
			(Trust Nominee director) and
			<lb />
			not CPM, who proposed to
			<lb />
			initiate legal action against
			<lb />
			Siva. (Para 231)
			<lb />
			12. With respect to Tata
			<lb />
			Capital giving a loan to Mr.
			<lb />
			Siva, due diligence carried
			<lb />
			out on the same, and no role
			<lb />
			in the grant of this loan can
			<lb />
			be attributed to RNT. (Para
			<lb />
			234)
			<lb />
			13.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			acquisition
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Dishnet DSL (DDSL) from
			<lb />
			Siva group took place in
			<lb />
			2004. CPM has not argued
			<lb />
			that he was unaware of this
			<lb />
			acquisition. Nor has it been
			<lb />
			argued that RNT made any
			<lb />
			illicit gain out of it. In fact, it
			<lb />
			was commercial decision of
			<lb />
			TTSL. This issue was brought
			<lb />
			to the notice of CPM way
			<lb />
			back in October, 2013, but he
			<lb />
			never complained earlier.
			<lb />
			(Para 235)
			<lb />
			Neither TTSL nor Kalimati
			<lb />
			nor
			<lb />
			Tata
			<lb />
			Capital
			<lb />

			arrayed as party to the

			proceeding.

			Global terrorist.

			for Joint Venture was placed
			<lb />
			on 06.12.2012, CPM was
			<lb />
			active in discussions and was
			<lb />
			a consenting party to the
			<lb />
			same. The said Joint Venture
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			incorporated
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			28.03.2013 and CPM did not
			<lb />
			raise any issue till his
			<lb />
			removal in 2016. (Para 242-
			<lb />
			244)
			<lb />
			CPM contends that the deal
			<lb />
			was struck with Mr. Hamid
			<lb />
			Reza Malakotipour who was
			<lb />
			classified
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			a
			<lb />
			Global
			<lb />
			terrorist
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			United
			<lb />
			Nations.
			<lb />
			However,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			allegation
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			indirectly
			<lb />
			financing terrorism through
			<lb />
			the involvement of such third
			<lb />
			parties,
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			serious
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			demeaning. (Para 241)
			<lb />
			After claiming that he has no
			<lb />
			say
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			AirAsia
			<lb />
			transactions, CPM claims to
			<lb />
			have protected the interest of
			<lb />
			the company by limiting its
			<lb />
			exposure and ensuring no
			<lb />
			fallback liability. These two
			<lb />
			claims conflict with each
			<lb />
			other. (Para 242)
			<lb />
			With respect to the Joint
			<lb />
			Venture
			<lb />
			with
			<lb />
			Singapore
			<lb />
			Airlines to set up Vistara, all
			<lb />
			Air Asia decision are fait
			<lb />
			accompli upon him, and thus,
			<lb />
			he is estopped from denying
			<lb />
			knowledge regarding these
			<lb />
			transactions. (Para 244)
			<lb />
			It would be preposterous to
			<lb />
			allege that RNT funded a
			<lb />
			terrorist through hawala with
			<lb />
			diversion of AirAsia India
			<lb />
			funds. (Para 245)

			<lb />
			04.05.2013 pertained to issue

			<lb />

			<lb />
			This (Alibaug) was a regular
			<lb />
			transfer that took place in
			<lb />
			1993. Previously, Aqua Farms
			<lb />
			had made payments to the
			<lb />
			original
			<lb />
			landowner
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			purchase, but the sale deed
			<lb />
			did not fructify. Aqua Farms
			<lb />
			was made a confirming party,
			<lb />
			as RNT reimbursed Aqua
			<lb />
			Farms
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			original
			<lb />
			payment that it had made to
			<lb />
			the original land owners.
			<lb />
			Simply put, the moment RNT
			<lb />
			reimbursed Aqua Farms, the
			<lb />
			vendors of the land would
			<lb />
			execute the sale deed in
			<lb />
			favour of RNT. This was a

			mere

			<lb />

			Corus

			<lb />
			The allegation that Tata Steel
			<lb />
			acquired Corus at an inflated
			<lb />
			price is without basis. (Para

			<lb />
			The price quoted by Tata
			<lb />
			Steel was GBP 608 Pence per
			<lb />
			share,
			<lb />
			while
			<lb />
			their
			<lb />
			competitors&apos; final bid was
			<lb />
			GBP 603 Pence per share.
			<lb />
			(Para 301)
			<lb />
			Acquisition of Corus was a
			<lb />
			collective decision by Tata
			<lb />
			Steel. CPM (Director at Tata
			<lb />
			Steel)
			<lb />
			approved
			<lb />
			every
			<lb />
			resolution of Tata Steel, for

			entering into auction and for

			confirming
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />

			<lb />
			of

			<lb />
			To salvage the company from
			<lb />
			the losses incurred from the
			<lb />
			Corus
			<lb />
			acquisition,
			<lb />
			TSL
			<lb />
			entered into a merger with
			<lb />
			ThyssenKrupp. There is no
			<lb />
			material to prove that RNT
			<lb />
			had any role in preventing

			the same. (Para 303)
			<lb />
			Moreover, CPM never raised

			NCLAT, being an Appellate Tribunal, conferred with the
			<lb />
			power under subSection (4) of Section 421 to confirm, modify or
			<lb />
			set aside the order of NCLT, can be taken to be a final court of fact.
			<lb />
			An appeal from the Order of the NCLAT to this Court under Section
			<lb />
			423 is only on a question of law. Considering the nature of the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction conferred upon NCLAT, it is clear that the findings of
			<lb />
			the NCLT, not specifically modified or set aside by NCLAT should be
			<lb />
			taken to have reached finality, unless the parties aggrieved by such
			<lb />
			noninterference by NCLAT have approached this Court, raising this
			<lb />
			as an issue. Though SP group has also filed an appeal in C.A. No.
			<lb />
			1802 of 2020, the grievance aired therein, as seen from para 3 of
			<lb />
			the memorandum of appeal, is limited to the failure of NCLAT to
			<lb />
			grant certain reliefs. The failure of NCLAT to specifically overturn
			<lb />
			the findings of fact recorded by NCLT, is not assailed in the SP
			<lb />
			group&apos;s appeal. Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that the
			<lb />
			allegations relating to
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			transactions with Siva and Sterling Group of Companies;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Air Asia;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Transactions with Mehli Mistry;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) the losses suffered by Tata Motors in Nano car project;
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) the acquisition of Corus
			<lb />
			reached finality.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			16.9
			<lb />
			The findings recorded by NCLAT for the grant of reliefs,
			<lb />
			revolved primarily around the removal of CPM, the affirmative
			<lb />
			voting rights, interference by nominee Directors and the conversion
			<lb />
			of Tata Sons into a private company. In other words, these are the 4
			<lb />
			areas in which NCLAT can be taken to have undertaken a scrutiny
			<lb />
			and reversed the findings of NCLT. Therefore, for answering the first
			<lb />
			question of law, we need to focus mainly on these issues on which
			<lb />
			NCLAT expressly overruled NCLT.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.10
			<lb />
			Out of these 4 specific issues on which NCLAT overruled
			<lb />
			NCLT, 3 issues will also be covered in our discussion on questions
			<lb />
			of law 4 and 5.. Therefore, we shall take up in this chapter, the
			<lb />
			question (i) whether the removal of CPM could have been the basis
			<lb />
			for the allegation that the company&apos;s affairs have been or are being
			<lb />
			conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of
			<lb />
			some of the members and (ii) whether the findings recorded by
			<lb />
			NCLAT about the existence of just and equitable clause is in
			<lb />
			accordance with the well established principles of law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			Removal of CPM
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			16.11
			<lb />
			CPM was first removed only from the post of Executive
			<lb />
			Chairman of Tata Sons, but not from the Directorship, by the
			<lb />
			resolution of the Board dated 24.10.2016. This acted as the trigger
			<lb />
			point for CPM, to launch an offensive. On the very next day namely
			<lb />
			25.10.2016, CPM wrote a mail alleging total lack of corporate
			<lb />
			governance and failure on the part of the directors to discharge
			<lb />
			their fiduciary duties. He also called all the Trust nominee directors
			<lb />
			as postmen. Though the mail was labelled as &apos;confidential&apos;, a copy
			<lb />
			of the mail landed up with the media creating a &quot;sensation&quot;. NCLT
			<lb />
			recorded a finding that CPM who owes a duty to explain this
			<lb />
			leakage of confidential mail, could not provide a satisfactory answer
			<lb />
			and that therefore, by virtue of section 106 of the Evidence Act, the
			<lb />
			leakage has to be traced to CPM. NCLAT did not overrule this
			<lb />
			finding.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.12
			<lb />
			The mail compelled Tata sons to issue a Press Statement
			<lb />
			on 10.11.2016. This was followed by the removal of CPM from the
			<lb />
			Directorship of Tata Industries Limited, Tata Consultancy Services
			<lb />
			Limited and Tata Teleservices Limited, all of which happened during
			<lb />
			the period from December 12 to December 14, 2016. Seeing clearly
			<lb />
			the course of destiny (which was actually set in motion by none
			<lb />
			other than himself), CPM resigned from other operating companies
			<lb />
			of Tatas such as The Indian Hotels Company Limited, Tata Steel
			<lb />
			Limited, Tata Motors Limited, Tata Chemicals Limited and Tata
			<lb />
			Power Limited, on 19.12.2016, on the eve of the Extraordinary
			<lb />
			General Meetings of those companies, convened for considering
			<lb />
			resolutions for his removal. On the very next day namely,
			<lb />
			20.12.2016 the complainant companies, of which CPM is the pivot,
			<lb />
			filed a petition C.P.No.82 of 2016 before NCLT, Mumbai, under
			<lb />
			Sections 241 and 242 read with Section 244 of the Companies Act,
			<lb />
			2013.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.13
			<lb />
			Around this time, as if by coincidence, the Principal
			<lb />
			Officer of Tata Sons received a letter dated 29.11.2016 from the
			<lb />
			Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) seeking certain
			<lb />
			information under Section 133(6) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in
			<lb />
			the case of Tata Education Trust. Tata Sons, through a reply dated
			<lb />
			09.12.2016 furnished necessary information along with the
			<lb />
			requested documents. The Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax
			<lb />
			also called for some additional information by subsequent letters,
			<lb />
			and the information so called for, was also furnished.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.14
			<lb />
			Claiming that a mail dated 20.12.2016 issued by the
			<lb />
			Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax seeking further information
			<lb />
			under Section 133(6) was copymarked to him, CPM sent a reply to
			<lb />
			the Income Tax department confirming (i) that the Directors
			<lb />
			appointed by Tata Trust controlled the decision making processes
			<lb />
			by virtue of the affirmative voting rights; (ii) that RNT and
			<lb />
			Soonawala have on many occasions sought prior information and
			<lb />
			consultation; (iii) that the conduct of the Trustees posed several
			<lb />
			regulatory risks; and (iv) that the office of RNT, in his capacity as
			<lb />
			Chairman Emeritus was funded by Tata Sons, including the cost of
			<lb />
			his overseas travel by private jet. To this letter to the Deputy
			<lb />
			Commissioner of Income Tax was enclosed certain files purportedly
			<lb />
			containing the information sought.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.15
			<lb />
			Upon coming to know of CPM&apos;s letter to the Deputy
			<lb />
			Commissioner of Income Tax, Tata Sons lodged a protest through a
			<lb />
			letter dated 26.12.2016. It was followed by a legal notice issued by
			<lb />
			Tata Sons to CPM on 27.12.2016 pointing out that he was guilty of
			<lb />
			breach of confidentiality and that he had passed on confidential
			<lb />
			and sensitive information contained in 4 box files, without any
			<lb />
			authority. CPM sent a legal reply dated 05.01.2017 claiming that he
			<lb />
			had a statutory obligation to cooperate with Income Tax authorities.
			<lb />
			As if to display his courage of conviction, CPM sent another letter
			<lb />
			dated 12.01.2017 to the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax
			<lb />
			sending one more file and assuring the authorities that he would
			<lb />
			continue to check the records and submit any additional
			<lb />
			data/information as and when available.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.16
			<lb />
			In the light of whatever transpired as narrated above, a
			<lb />
			&quot;Special Notice and Requisition&quot; was moved on 03.01.2017
			<lb />
			convening an EGM of Tata Sons for considering the removal of CPM
			<lb />
			as Director of Tata sons. It must be remembered at this stage that
			<lb />
			by the Resolution of the Board of Tata Sons dated 24.10.2016, CPM
			<lb />
			was merely removed from the post of Executive Chairman, but he
			<lb />
			continued to be a member of the Board as a Non Executive Director
			<lb />
			even after 24.10.2016. It must also be remembered that it was
			<lb />
			during his continuance as the member of the Board that CPM
			<lb />
			exchanged correspondence/legal notice with Tata Sons and also
			<lb />
			passed on information along with certain files, to the Income Tax
			<lb />
			authorities claiming to be a very &quot;law abiding citizen&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.17
			<lb />
			Since the EGM of Tata sons was scheduled to be held on
			<lb />
			06.02.2017, for considering the resolution for CPM&apos;s removal from
			<lb />
			the Directorship, the Companies (S.P. Group) which filed the
			<lb />
			complaint before the NCLT moved an interim application before
			<lb />
			NCLT for a stay of the EGM. NCLT declined stay and the appeal
			<lb />
			against the refusal to grant stay was also dismissed by NCLAT.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the EGM proceeded as scheduled on 06.02.2017 and
			<lb />
			CPM was removed from the Directorship of Tata Sons. In his place
			<lb />
			Mr. N. Chandrasekharan, was appointed as Executive Chairman.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.18
			<lb />
			In the Company Petition as it was originally filed on
			<lb />
			20.12.2016, the complainant companies had sought a set of 21
			<lb />
			reliefs, one of which was for a direction to the respondents (the
			<lb />
			company and its directors) not to remove CPM (who was cited as R
			<lb />
			11 in the original petition) from the directorship of Tata Sons. This
			<lb />
			was in prayer clause (F) of Paragraph 153 of the main company
			<lb />
			petition. This prayer was in direct contrast to the reliefs sought in
			<lb />
			prayer clauses (A) and (B). Prayer clause (A) was for superseding the
			<lb />
			existing Board of Directors and appointment of an Administrator.
			<lb />
			Prayer in clause (B) was for appointment of a retired Supreme Court
			<lb />
			Judge as Non Executive Chairman and for appointment of a new set
			<lb />
			of independent Directors.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.19
			<lb />
			After the dismissal of the interim application moved for
			<lb />
			stalling the EGM scheduled to be held on 06.02.2017 and after the
			<lb />
			passing of the resolution for the removal of CPM in the EGM held
			<lb />
			on 06.02.2017, the complainant companies moved an application
			<lb />
			for amendment of the original petition so as to include two
			<lb />
			additional prayers namely (i) reinstatement of the representative of
			<lb />
			the complainant companies on the Board of Tata Sons; and (ii)
			<lb />
			amendment of the Articles of Association to provide for proportional
			<lb />
			representation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.20.
			<lb />
			However, eventually the prayers made in clauses (A), (B)
			<lb />
			and (C) were not pressed. Prayers in clauses (F), (Q) &amp; (R) were also
			<lb />
			not pressed on the ground that they had become infructuous. In
			<lb />
			Paragraph 3.4 above we have extracted the reliefs as originally
			<lb />
			sought in the main company petition and in the table in Paragraph
			<lb />
			4.11 we have indicated the prayers additionally made and the reliefs
			<lb />
			either given up or sought to be modified.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.21
			<lb />
			In fact the real reason why the complainant companies
			<lb />
			thought fit, quite tactfully, not to press for the reinstatement of
			<lb />
			CPM is that the mere termination of Directorship cannot be
			<lb />
			projected as something that would trigger the just and equitable
			<lb />
			clause for winding up or to grant relief under Sections 241 and 242.
			<lb />
			A useful reference can be made in this regard to the decision of this
			<lb />
			Court in Hanuman Prasad Bagri &amp; Ors. vs. Bagress Cereals
			<lb />
			Pvt. Ltd. 2 .
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.22
			<lb />
			It must be remembered : (i) that a provision for inclusion
			<lb />
			of a representative of small shareholders in the Board of Directors,
			<lb />
			is of a recent origin under Section 151 of the Companies Act, 2013
			<lb />
			and it is applicable only to a listed company; (ii) that Tata sons is
			<lb />
			not a listed Company; (iii) that the Articles of Association of Tata
			<lb />
			sons, to which the complainant companies, CPM and his father had
			<lb />
			subscribed, do not provide for any representation; (iv) that despite
			<lb />
			there being no statutory or contractual obligation, Tata Sons
			<lb />
			inducted CPM&apos;s father as a director on the board in the year 1980
			<lb />
			and continued him for a period of almost 25 years; (v) that CPM
			<lb />
			himself was inducted, again without reference to any statutory or
			<lb />
			contractual obligation, as a Director on the Board in August, 2006;
			<lb />
			and (vi) that within 6 years of such induction, CPM was identified
			<lb />
			as a successor to RNT and was appointed as Executive Deputy
			<lb />
			Chairman and elevated to the position of Executive Chairman.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.23
			<lb />
			It is an irony that the very same person who represents
			<lb />
			shareholders owning just 18.37% of the total paid up share capital
			<lb />
			and yet identified as the successor to the empire, has chosen to
			<lb />
			accuse the very same Board, of conduct, oppressive and unfairly
			<lb />
			prejudicial to the interests of the minorities. In support of such
			<lb />
			allegation, the complainant companies have pointed out certain
			<lb />
			business decisions taken during the period of more than 10 years
			<lb />
			immediately preceding the date of removal of CPM. That failed
			<lb />
			business decisions and the removal of a person from Directorship
			<lb />
			can never be projected as acts oppressive or prejudicial to the
			<lb />
			interests of the minorities, is too well settled. In fact it may be
			<lb />
			concede today by Tata sons that one important decision that the
			<lb />
			Board took on 16.03.2012 certainly turned out to be a wrong
			<lb />
			decision of a life time.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.24
			<lb />
			Therefore, the fact that the removal of CPM was only from
			<lb />
			the Executive Chairmanship and not the Directorship of the
			<lb />
			company as on the date of filing of the petition and the fact that in
			<lb />
			law, even the removal from Directorship can never be held to be an
			<lb />
			oppressive or prejudicial conduct, was sufficient to throw the
			<lb />
			petition under section 241 out, especially since NCLAT chose not to
			<lb />
			interfere with the findings of fact on certain business decisions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.25
			<lb />
			The subsequent conduct on the part of CPM in leaking
			<lb />
			his mail dated 25102016 to the Press and sending replies to the
			<lb />
			Income Tax Authorities enclosing 4 box files, even while continuing
			<lb />
			as a Director, justified his removal even from the Directorship of
			<lb />
			Tata Sons and other group companies. A person who tries to set his
			<lb />
			own house on fire for not getting what he perceives as legitimately
			<lb />
			due to him, does not deserve to continue as part of any decision
			<lb />
			making body (not just the Board of a company). It is perhaps this
			<lb />
			realisation that made the complainant companies give up their
			<lb />
			original prayer for restraining the company from removing CPM and
			<lb />
			singing a different tune seeking proportionate representation on the
			<lb />
			Board.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.26
			<lb />
			For assailing the decision to remove CPM from the
			<lb />
			Chairmanship of Tata Sons, it is contended (i) that Tata Group
			<lb />
			performed exceedingly well under his stewardship; (ii) that the
			<lb />
			Nomination and Remuneration Committee for the Financial Year
			<lb />
			201516 endorsed his performance and even recommended a pay
			<lb />
			hike and performance linked bonus; and (iii) that the Board
			<lb />
			unanimously approved these recommendations on 29.6.2016 just
			<lb />
			four months before his unceremonious removal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.27
			<lb />
			First of all, the above contention is in direct conflict with
			<lb />
			the entire foundation on which the whole case of the complainant
			<lb />
			companies was erected. If CPM and the members of the Nomination
			<lb />
			and Remuneration Committee as well as the entire Board were on
			<lb />
			the same page till 29.6.2016 that the company was doing well
			<lb />
			under the stewardship of CPM, then there can be no allegation that
			<lb />
			the company&apos;s affairs were conducted in a manner oppressive or
			<lb />
			prejudicial to the interest of anyone, namely the company or the
			<lb />
			minority, at least until 29.6.2016. On the contrary if the company&apos;s
			<lb />
			affairs have been conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial,
			<lb />
			even before 29.6.2016, the other members of the Board and CPM
			<lb />
			could not have formed themselves into a mutual admiration society
			<lb />
			to laud CPM&apos;s performance and CPM acknowledging that the
			<lb />
			company was doing well when he was in the driver&apos;s seat.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.28
			<lb />
			An important aspect to be noticed is that in a petition
			<lb />
			under Section 241, the Tribunal cannot ask the question whether
			<lb />
			the removal of a Director was legally valid and/or justified or not.
			<lb />
			The question to be asked is whether such a removal tantamount to
			<lb />
			a conduct oppressive or prejudicial to some members. Even in cases
			<lb />
			where the Tribunal finds that the removal of a Director was not in
			<lb />
			accordance with law or was not justified on facts, the Tribunal
			<lb />
			cannot grant a relief under Section 242 unless the removal was
			<lb />
			oppressive or prejudicial.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.29
			<lb />
			There may be cases where the removal of a Director
			<lb />
			might have been carried out perfectly in accordance with law and
			<lb />
			yet may be part of a larger design to oppress or prejudice the
			<lb />
			interests of some members. It is only in such cases that the
			<lb />
			Tribunal can grant a relief under Section 242. The Company
			<lb />
			Tribunal is not a labour Court or an administrative Tribunal to
			<lb />
			focus entirely on the manner of removal of a person from
			<lb />
			Directorship. Therefore, the accolades received by CPM from the
			<lb />
			Nomination and Remuneration Committee or the Board of Directors
			<lb />
			on 29.6.2016, cannot advance his case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.30
			<lb />
			A contention was raised that CPM&apos;s removal was a pre
			<lb />
			meditated act, carried out at the behest of Tata Trusts and RNT and
			<lb />
			that the removal was not only contrary to Article 118, but also
			<lb />
			contrary to Article 105(a) read with the second proviso to Section
			<lb />
			179(1) and Article 122(b).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.31
			<lb />
			As we have pointed out above, the validity of and
			<lb />
			justification for the removal of a person can never be the primary
			<lb />
			focus of a Tribunal under Section 242 unless the same is in
			<lb />
			furtherance of a conduct oppressive or prejudicial to some of the
			<lb />
			members. In fact the post of Executive Chairman is not statutorily
			<lb />
			recognised or regulated, though the post of a Director is. At the cost
			<lb />
			of repetition it should be pointed out that CPM was removed only
			<lb />
			from the post of (or designation as) Executive Chairman and not
			<lb />
			from the post of Director till the Company Petition was filed. But
			<lb />
			CPM himself invited trouble, by declaring an all out war, which led
			<lb />
			to his removal from Directorship.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.32
			<lb />
			It is true that as per the evidence available on record he
			<lb />
			was requested before the Board meeting, to step down from the post
			<lb />
			of Executive Chairman. That does not tantamount to the act being
			<lb />
			premeditated. The induction of new members on 8.8.2016 into the
			<lb />
			Board and the Board securing a legal opinion prior to the Board
			<lb />
			meeting, cannot make the act a premeditated one. There is a thin
			<lb />
			line of demarcation between a wellconceived plan and a pre
			<lb />
			meditated one and the line can many times be blurred.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.33
			<lb />
			Article 118 around which arguments were advanced
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;118. APPOINTMENT OF CHAIRMAN
			<lb />
			For the purpose of selecting a new Chairman of the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors and so long as the Tata Trusts own and hold in the
			<lb />
			aggregate at least 40% of the paid up Ordinary Share Capital
			<lb />
			of the Company for the time being, a Selection Committee
			<lb />
			shall be constituted in accordance with the provisions of this
			<lb />
			Article to recommend the appointment of a person as the
			<lb />
			Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Board may
			<lb />
			appoint the person so recommended as the Chairman of the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors, subject to Article 121 which requires the
			<lb />
			affirmative vote of all Directors appointed pursuant to Article
			<lb />
			104B.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The same process shall be followed for the removal of the
			<lb />
			incumbent Chairman.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The Selection Committee shall comprise -(a) Three (3) persons
			<lb />
			nominated jointly by the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir
			<lb />
			Ratan Tata Trust who may or may not be Directors of the
			<lb />
			Company, (b) one (1) person nominated by and from amongst
			<lb />
			the Board of Directors of the Company and (c) one (1)
			<lb />
			independent outside person selected by the Board for this
			<lb />
			purpose.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The Chairman of the Committee will be selected by the Sir
			<lb />
			Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust from amongst
			<lb />
			the nominees nominated by the Trusts.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The quorum for a meeting of the Selection Committee shall be
			<lb />
			the presence of a majority of members nominated jointly by
			<lb />
			the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation: The words &quot;nominated jointly&apos; used in this
			<lb />
			Article shall mean that the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir
			<lb />
			Ratan Tata Trust shall together decide the nominees. In the
			<lb />
			case of any difference, the decision of the majority of the
			<lb />
			Trustees in the aggregate of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the
			<lb />
			Sir Ratan Tata Trust shall prevail.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			16.34
			<lb />
			The sentence in Article 118 reading &quot;the same process
			<lb />
			shall be followed for the removal of incumbent Chairman&quot; actually
			<lb />
			goes along with the last limb of the portion immediately preceding
			<lb />
			this line. It deals with the appointment of a person as Chairman,
			<lb />
			pursuant to the recommendation of a Selection Committee, subject
			<lb />
			to Article 121 which requires the affirmative vote of the Directors
			<lb />
			appointed in terms of Article 104B.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.35
			<lb />
			It is absurd to interpret Article 118 to mean that
			<lb />
			Selection Committee is to be constituted for the removal of an
			<lb />
			incumbent Chairman. The necessity for taking recourse to the
			<lb />
			affirmative voting right under Article 121 is what is meant by the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;the same process&quot; appearing in the second part of
			<lb />
			Article 118.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.36
			<lb />
			The argument pitched upon Article 105(a) is also
			<lb />
			completely unfounded. Article 105(a) deals with the power of the
			<lb />
			Board to appoint a Managing Director, Joint/Deputy Managing
			<lb />
			Director or Whole Time Director. The provision relating to Executive
			<lb />
			Chairman is not to be found in Article 105(a) but in Article 105(b)
			<lb />
			which reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The Board shall have the power to designate the Chairman
			<lb />
			of the Board as the Executive Chairman and pay him such
			<lb />
			remuneration as, in their opinion, they deem fit&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Therefore, the argument on the basis of Article 105(a) is illfounded.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.37
			<lb />
			The contention that the removal was in violation of the
			<lb />
			second proviso to Section 179(1) read with Article 122(b) is also ill
			<lb />
			conceived. The second proviso to Section 179(1) prohibits the Board
			<lb />
			from exercising any power that could be exercised by the company
			<lb />
			only in a General Meeting. Article 122(a) is only a reiteration of the
			<lb />
			principle behind the second proviso to Section 179(1). Article 122(b)
			<lb />
			says that the Board may exercise all such powers as are not
			<lb />
			required to be exercised by the company in General Meeting. The
			<lb />
			designation of a person as Executive Chairman, is not one of
			<lb />
			the functions to be performed in a general meeting, either under the
			<lb />
			Act or under the Articles of association.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.38
			<lb />
			It is also contended that no advance notice of his removal
			<lb />
			was given to CPM and no agenda item was placed in advance in
			<lb />
			terms of Article 121B, which reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;121B. Any Director of the Company will be entitled to give at
			<lb />
			least fifteen days notice to the Company or to the Board that
			<lb />
			any matter or resolution be placed for deliberation by the
			<lb />
			Board and if such notice is received it shall be mandatory for
			<lb />
			the Board to take up such matter or resolution for
			<lb />
			consideration and vote, at the Board meeting next held after
			<lb />
			the period of such notice, before considering any other matter
			<lb />
			or resolution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			16.39
			<lb />
			We do not know how Article 121B is sought to be
			<lb />
			invoked. It deals with a situation where a Director wants to bring
			<lb />
			up any matter or resolution before the Board. It has no relevance to
			<lb />
			the agenda that the Board wants to take up. Even according to the
			<lb />
			complainant companies, the Directors of a Company have a
			<lb />
			fiduciary relationship. It is a relationship in which one party places
			<lb />
			special trust, confidence and reliance on another. It is claimed by
			<lb />
			the appellants (Tata Group) that the removal of CPM was as a result
			<lb />
			of lack of confidence and trust in him. By his own subsequent
			<lb />
			conduct, CPM unfortunately enhanced the firepower of the
			<lb />
			management of Tata Sons, with regard to their claim relating to lack
			<lb />
			of confidence and trust.

			The decision in Central Bank of India Ltd. vs. Hartford
			<lb />
			Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. 3 is relied upon by the S.P. Group to
			<lb />
			contend that the power of removal of a Director is subservient to the
			<lb />
			agreed duration of office. But the decision in Central Bank of India
			<lb />
			arose out of the termination of a fire insurance policy. It had
			<lb />
			nothing to do with the removal of a Director. But a decision of the
			<lb />
			King&apos;s Bench in Nelson vs. James Nelson 4 was relied upon in the
			<lb />
			said case to assail the termination of the insurance policy. After
			<lb />
			pointing out that Nelson was a case where the termination assailed
			<lb />
			was that of the services of the Managing Director and that the
			<lb />
			contract of his appointment did not provide for his termination
			<lb />
			except on the condition of his ceasing to be a Director, this Court
			<lb />
			rejected the citation in Central Bank of India on the ground that it
			<lb />
			had no relevance to the termination of a policy of insurance.

			The decision in M.I. Builders Pvt. Limited vs. Radhey
			<lb />
			Shyam Sahu &amp; Others 5 , to the effect that an important issue
			<lb />
			cannot be decided under the residuary agenda item &quot;any other
			<lb />
			item&quot;, will not also go to the rescue of the complainant companies,
			<lb />
			since the matter in M.I. Builders concerned the permission granted
			<lb />
			by the Municipal Corporation to a builder to construct an
			<lb />
			underground shopping complex in a park. The Court found the
			<lb />
			decision taken by the Mahapalika to be in clear breach of Sections
			<lb />
			91 and 119 of the U.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1959. Therefore,
			<lb />
			the said decision has no application.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.42
			<lb />
			In any event the removal of a person from the post of
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman cannot be termed as oppressive or prejudicial.
			<lb />
			The original cause of action for the complainant companies to
			<lb />
			approach NCLT was the removal of CPM from the post of Executive
			<lb />
			Chairman. Though the complainant companies padded up their
			<lb />
			actual grievance with various historical facts to make a deceptive
			<lb />
			appearance, the causa proxima for the complaint was the removal of
			<lb />
			CPM from the office of Executive Chairman. His removal from
			<lb />
			Directorship happened subsequent to the filing of the original
			<lb />
			complaint and that too for valid and justifiable reasons and hence
			<lb />
			NCLAT could not have laboured so much on the removal of CPM, for
			<lb />
			granting relief under Sections 241 and 242.
			<lb />

			Invocation of just and equitable clause
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			16.43
			<lb />
			Interestingly, NCLAT has recorded a finding, though not
			<lb />
			based upon any factual foundation, that the facts otherwise justify
			<lb />
			the making of a winding up order on just and equitable ground. But
			<lb />
			as held by the Privy Council in Loch v. John Blackwood 6 , &quot;there
			<lb />
			must lie a justifiable lack of confidence in the conduct and
			<lb />
			management of the company&apos;s affairs, at the foundation of
			<lb />
			applications for winding up.&quot; More importantly, &quot;the lack of
			<lb />
			confidence must spring not from dissatisfaction at being outvoted on
			<lb />
			the business affairs or on what is called the domestic policy of the
			<lb />
			company&quot;. But, &quot;wherever the lack of confidence is rested on a lack
			<lb />
			of probity in the conduct of the company&apos;s affairs, then the former is
			<lb />
			justified by the latter.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.44
			<lb />
			A passage from the opinion of Lord President of the Court
			<lb />
			of Session (Lord Clyde) in Baird v. Lees 7 , quoted in Loch (supra),
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;A shareholder puts his money into a company on certain
			<lb />
			conditions. The first of them is that the business in which he
			<lb />
			invests shall be limited to certain definite objects. The second
			<lb />
			is that it shall be carried on by certain persons elected in a
			<lb />
			specified way. And the third is that the business shall be
			<lb />
			conducted in accordance with certain principles of commercial
			<lb />
			administration defined in the statute, which provide some
			<lb />
			guarantee of commercial probity and efficiency.
			<lb />
			If
			<lb />
			shareholders find that these conditions or some of them are
			<lb />
			deliberately and consistently violated and set aside by the
			<lb />
			action of a member and official of the company who wields an
			<lb />
			overwhelming voting power, and if the result of that is that,
			<lb />
			for the extrication of their rights as shareholders, they are
			<lb />
			deprived of the ordinary facilities which compliance with the
			<lb />
			Companies Acts would provide them with, then there does
			<lb />
			arise, in my opinion, a situation in which it may be just and
			<lb />
			equitable for the Court to wind up the company.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			16.45
			<lb />
			If the above tests are applied, the case on hand will not
			<lb />
			fall anywhere near the just and equitable standard, for the simple
			<lb />
			reason that it was the very same complaining minority whose
			<lb />
			representative was not merely given a berth on the Board but was
			<lb />
			also projected as the successor to the Office of Chairman.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.46
			<lb />
			In Ebrahimi v. Westbourne Galleries Ltd. 8 , decided by
			<lb />
			House of Lords, one of the Directors who was voted out of office by
			<lb />
			the other two Directors (fatherson duo) petitioned for an order
			<lb />
			under Section 210 of the English Companies Act, 1948. The very
			<lb />
			relief sought by the ousted director was for a direction to the other
			<lb />
			two persons to purchase his shares in the Company or to sell their
			<lb />
			shares to him on such terms as the Court should think fit.
			<lb />
			Alternatively, he prayed for winding up. The Court of the first
			<lb />
			instance held that a case for winding up had been made out, as the
			<lb />
			majority was guilty of abuse of power and a breach of good faith
			<lb />
			which the partners owed to each other not to exclude one of them
			<lb />
			from all participation in the business. The court of Appeal reversed
			<lb />
			it by applying the tests of (i) bonafide exercise of power in the
			<lb />
			interest of the company; and (ii) whether a reasonable man could
			<lb />
			think that the removal was in the interest of the Company. While
			<lb />
			reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, the House of Lords
			<lb />
			held, that &quot;the formula &apos;bonafide interest of the company&apos;
			<lb />
			should not become little more than an alibi for a refusal to
			<lb />
			consider the merits of the case.&quot; Holding that, &quot;equity always
			<lb />
			does enable the Court to subject the exercise of legal rights to
			<lb />
			equitable considerations namely considerations that is of a
			<lb />
			personal character&quot;, the House of Lords added some caution in
			<lb />
			the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The superimposition of equitable considerations requires
			<lb />
			something more, which typically may include one, or probably
			<lb />
			more, of the following elements: (i) an association formed or
			<lb />
			continued on the basis of a personal relationship, involving
			<lb />
			mutual confidence -this element will often be found where a
			<lb />
			preexisting partnership has been converted into a limited
			<lb />
			company; (ii) an agreement, or understanding, that all, or
			<lb />
			some (for there may be &quot;sleeping&quot; members), of the
			<lb />
			shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the business;
			<lb />
			(iii) restriction upon the transfer of the members&apos; interest in the
			<lb />
			company -so that if confidence is lost, or one member is
			<lb />
			removed from management, he cannot take out his stake and
			<lb />
			go elsewhere.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			16.47
			<lb />
			But it must be remembered that the origin of just and
			<lb />
			equitable clause is to be traced to the Law of Partnership which has
			<lb />
			developed, according to the House of Lords, &quot;the conceptions of
			<lb />
			probity, good faith and mutual confidence&quot;. Having said that,
			<lb />
			Ebrahimi pointed out that the reference to quasi partnerships or
			<lb />
			&quot;insubstance partnerships&quot; is also confusing for the reason that
			<lb />
			though the parties may have been partners in their &apos;Purvashrama&apos;,
			<lb />
			they had become comembers of a company accepting new
			<lb />
			obligations in law. Therefore, &quot;a company, however small,
			<lb />
			however domestic, is a company and not a partnership or even
			<lb />
			a quasi partnership&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.48
			<lb />
			That, &quot;for superimposing an equitable fetter on the
			<lb />
			exercise of the rights conferred by the Articles of Association, there
			<lb />
			must be something in the history of the company or the
			<lb />
			relationship between the shareholders&quot;, is fairly well settled 9 .
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.49
			<lb />
			In Lau v. Chu 10 , the House of Lords indicated, &quot;that a
			<lb />
			just and equitable winding up may be ordered where the company&apos;s
			<lb />
			members have fallen out in two related but distinct situations,
			<lb />
			which may or may not overlap&quot;. The first of these is labelled as,
			<lb />
			&quot;functional dead lock&quot;, where the inability of members to cooperate
			<lb />
			in the management of the company&apos;s affairs leads to an inability of
			<lb />
			the company to function at Board or shareholder level. The House
			<lb />
			of Lords pointed out that functional dead lock of a paralysing kind
			<lb />
			was first clearly recognised as a ground for just and equitable
			<lb />
			winding up In Re Sailing Ship Kentmere Co. 11 . The second of
			<lb />
			these is where a company is a corporate quasi partnership and an
			<lb />
			irretrievable breakdown in trust and confidence between the
			<lb />
			participating members has taken place. In the first type of these
			<lb />
			cases, where there is a complete functional dead lock, winding up
			<lb />
			may be ordered regardless whether the company is a quasi
			<lb />
			partnership or not. But in the second type of cases, a breakdown of
			<lb />
			trust and confidence is enough even if there is not a complete
			<lb />
			functional dead lock.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.50
			<lb />
			Therefore, for invoking the just and equitable standard,
			<lb />
			the underlying principle is that the Court should be satisfied either
			<lb />
			11 [1897] WN 58
			<lb />
			that the partners cannot carry on together or that one of them
			<lb />
			cannot certainly carry on with the other 12 .
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.51
			<lb />
			In the case in hand there was never and there could
			<lb />
			never have been a relationship in the nature of quasi partnership
			<lb />
			between the Tata Group and S.P. Group. S.P. Group boarded the
			<lb />
			train halfway through the journey of Tata Sons. Functional dead
			<lb />
			lock is not even pleaded nor proved.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.52
			<lb />
			Coming to the Indian cases, this court held in
			<lb />
			Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corpn. Ltd. v. Nageshwara Rao 13
			<lb />
			that for the invocation of just and equitable clause, there must be a
			<lb />
			justifiable lack of confidence on the conduct of the directors, as
			<lb />
			held. A mere lack of confidence between the majority shareholders
			<lb />
			and minority shareholders would not be sufficient, as pointed out in
			<lb />
			S.P. Jain v. Kalinga Tubes Ltd. 14
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12 The advantage that the English courts have is that irretrievable breakdown of relationship
			<lb />
			is recognised as a ground for separation both in a matrimonial relationship and in
			<lb />
			commercial relationship, while it is not so in India.
			<lb />
			13 (1955) 2 SCR 1066
			<lb />
			14 AIR 1965 SC 1535
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.53
			<lb />
			It was contended repeatedly that lack of probity in the
			<lb />
			conduct of the directors is a sufficient cause to invoke just and
			<lb />
			equitable clause. Drawing our attention to the landmark decision in
			<lb />
			Needle Industries (India) Ltd. and Ors. v. Needle Industries
			<lb />
			Newey (India) Ltd. and ors. 15 , it was contended that even the
			<lb />
			profitability of the company has no bearing if just and equitable
			<lb />
			standard is fulfilled and that the test is not whether an act is lawful
			<lb />
			or not but whether it is oppressive or not.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.54
			<lb />
			But all these arguments lose sight of the nature of
			<lb />
			the company that Tata Sons is. As we have indicated elsewhere,
			<lb />
			Tata Sons is a principal investment holding Company, of which the
			<lb />
			majority shareholding is with philanthropic Trusts. The majority
			<lb />
			shareholders are not individuals or corporate entities having deep
			<lb />
			pockets into which the dividends find their way if the Company
			<lb />
			does well and declares dividends. The dividends that the Trusts get
			<lb />
			are to find their way eventually to the fulfilment of charitable
			<lb />
			purposes. Therefore, NCLAT should have raised the most
			<lb />
			fundamental question whether it would be equitable to wind up the
			<lb />
			Company and thereby starve to death those charitable Trusts,
			<lb />
			especially on the basis of uncharitable allegations of oppressive
			<lb />
			and prejudicial conduct. Therefore, the finding of NCLAT that the
			<lb />
			facts otherwise justify the winding up of the Company under the
			<lb />
			just and equitable clause, is completely flawed.

			17. Question of Law No.2
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			17.1
			<lb />
			The second question of law arising for consideration is as
			<lb />
			to whether the reliefs granted and directions issued by NCLAT
			<lb />
			including the reinstatement of CPM into the Board of Tata Sons and
			<lb />
			other Tata Companies are in consonance with (i) the pleadings
			<lb />
			made, (ii) the reliefs sought and (iii) the powers available under
			<lb />
			SubSection (2) of Section 242.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.2
			<lb />
			As we have indicated in Para 3.4 above, the complainant
			<lb />
			companies originally sought a set of 21 reliefs listed in para 153 (A)
			<lb />
			to (U). Subsequently, the complainant companies sought the
			<lb />
			addition of two more prayers, through an application for
			<lb />
			amendment filed on 10.2.2017. The additional reliefs sought to be
			<lb />
			included were for: (i) reinstatement of a representative of the
			<lb />
			complainant companies on the Board of Tata Sons and (ii)
			<lb />
			Amendment of the Articles of Association so as to provide for
			<lb />
			proportional representation on the Board.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.3
			<lb />
			Thereafter the complainant companies sought a few more
			<lb />
			prayers through an application for amendment dated 31.10.2017.
			<lb />
			However, by a Memo dated 12.01.2018 the complainant companies
			<lb />
			gave up certain prayers, sought a modification of some other
			<lb />
			prayers and recorded that they were not pressing certain reliefs. At
			<lb />
			the cost of repetition, we have to present in a tabular form, the
			<lb />
			reliefs originally sought and the metamorphosis that they
			<lb />
			underwent through applications for amendment or Memo. It is as

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			iii.
			<lb />
			The Petitioners be entitled to representation on all

			<lb />
			Respondent No.1; ((Relief clause M restricted through
			<lb />
			memo dated 12012018)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(10) Set aside the resolution passed on 31092017 for amendment of
			<lb />
			the Articles and declare the conversion of Tata Sons into a private

			<lb />
			1 through Application for amendment)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(11) To delete Article 75 (Additional Relief sought to be included as clause
			<lb />
			M2 through Application for amendment)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(12) To reinstate a representative of the petitioners on the Board
			<lb />
			(Additional Relief sought to be included as clause F1 through
			<lb />
			Application for amendment)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			17.5
			<lb />
			Out of the aforesaid reliefs that came to stay till the end,
			<lb />
			NCLAT granted only certain reliefs, which in simple terms, were as
			<lb />
			follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Setting aside the removal of CPM and directing his
			<lb />
			reinstatement both as Executive Chairman of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons and as Director of other Tata Companies for
			<lb />
			the rest of the tenure.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Restraining RNT and the nominees of Tata Trust
			<lb />
			from taking any advance decision.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Restraining Tata Sons from exercising its power
			<lb />
			under Article 75 against the complainant companies
			<lb />
			and other minority members, except in exceptional
			<lb />
			circumstances and in the interest of the Company
			<lb />
			and that too after recording reasons and informing
			<lb />
			the affected parties.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) Setting aside the decision of the Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies recognising Tata Sons conversion into a
			<lb />
			Private Company.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			17.6
			<lb />
			Thus NCLAT granted to the complainant companies (and
			<lb />
			indirectly to CPM) four reliefs namely:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			reinstatement of CPM;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			declaring Tata Sons as a Public Limited Company;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) restraining the nominee Directors and RNT from
			<lb />
			taking any decision in advance and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) restraining the invocation of Article 75 except in
			<lb />
			exceptional circumstances.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			We shall now see whether NCLAT could have granted any of these
			<lb />
			reliefs.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<head>
			Reinstatement of CPM
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			17.7
			<lb />
			Removal and reinstatement are two different things. We
			<lb />
			have dealt with the issue of removal of CPM, while answering
			<lb />
			question of law No.1, in the context of whether it was part of a
			<lb />
			scheme of oppressive and prejudicial conduct. Now we shall deal
			<lb />
			with the issue of reinstatement in the context of the contours of
			<lb />
			section 242(2) and the nature of the orders that could be passed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.8
			<lb />
			As we have seen already, the original motive of the
			<lb />
			complainant companies, was to restrain Tata Sons from removing
			<lb />
			CPM as Director. Subsequently, there was a climb down and the
			<lb />
			complainant
			<lb />
			companies
			<lb />
			sought
			<lb />
			what
			<lb />
			they
			<lb />
			termed
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			&quot;reinstatement&quot; of a representative of the complainant companies.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, it was modulated into a cry for proportionate
			<lb />
			representation on the Board.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.9
			<lb />
			In this background it was repeatedly argued both before
			<lb />
			the NCLAT and before this Court that the objective of the litigation
			<lb />
			was not to have CPM reinstated, but only to set things right in the
			<lb />
			State of Denmark (of which CPM himself was the Premier for 4
			<lb />
			years). But interestingly, NCLAT understood what the complainant
			<lb />
			companies and CPM actually wanted, though they attempted to
			<lb />
			camouflage their intentions with legal niceties. Therefore, despite
			<lb />
			there being no prayer for reinstatement of CPM either as a Director
			<lb />
			or as an Executive Chairman of Tata Sons, NCLAT directed the
			<lb />
			restoration of CPM as Executive Chairman of Tata Sons and as
			<lb />
			Director of Tata Companies for the rest of the tenure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.10
			<lb />
			While granting much more than what the complainant
			<lb />
			companies and CPM themselves thought as legally feasible, NCLAT
			<lb />
			failed to notice one important thing. The appointment of CPM as
			<lb />
			Executive Deputy Chairman of Tata Sons, was to be for a period of
			<lb />
			5 years from 01.04.2012 to 31.03.2017, subject to the approval of
			<lb />
			the shareholders. In the Meeting of the shareholders held on
			<lb />
			01.08.2012, the appointment of CPM as Executive Deputy
			<lb />
			Chairman was approved and the General Body left it to the Board to
			<lb />
			redesignate CPM as Chairman. Accordingly, the Board re
			<lb />
			designated CPM as Executive Chairman, with effect from
			<lb />
			29.12.2012, by a resolution passed on 18.12.2012.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.11
			<lb />
			The judgment of the NCLAT was passed on 18.12.2019,
			<lb />
			by which time, a period of nearly 7 years had passed from the date
			<lb />
			of CPM&apos;s appointment as Executive Chairman. Therefore, we fail to
			<lb />
			understand : (i) as to how NCLAT could have granted a relief not
			<lb />
			apparently sought for (though wished for); and (ii) what NCLAT
			<lb />
			meant by reinstatement &quot;for the rest of the tenure&quot;. That the
			<lb />
			question of reinstatement will not arise after the tenure of office had
			<lb />
			run its course, is a settled position. In this regard, we may refer to
			<lb />
			the decisions in Raj Kumar Dey vs. Tarapada Dey 16 and Mohd.
			<lb />
			Gazi vs. State of Madhya Pradesh 17 . While so, it is
			<lb />
			incomprehensible that the NCLAT directed reinstatement, and that
			<lb />
			too, of a Director of a company, after the expiry of his term of office.
			<lb />
			Needless to say that such a remedy would not have been granted
			<lb />
			even by a labour court/service Tribunal in matters coming within
			<lb />
			their jurisdiction.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.12
			<lb />
			In fact NCLAT has gone to the extent of reinstating CPM
			<lb />
			not only on the Board of Tata Sons, but also on the Board of Tata
			<lb />
			group companies, without they being parties, without there being
			<lb />
			any complaint against those companies under section 241 and
			<lb />
			without there being any prayer against them. These companies have
			<lb />
			followed the procedure prescribed by Statute and the Articles and
			<lb />
			they have validly passed resolutions for his removal. For instance,
			<lb />
			TCS granted an opportunity to CPM and held a general meeting in
			<lb />
			which 93.11% of the shareholders, including public institutions
			<lb />
			who hold 57.46% of shares supported the resolution. In any case
			<lb />
			CPM&apos;s tenure itself was to come to an end on 16.06.2017 but
			<lb />
			NCLAT passed the impugned order reinstating him &quot;for the rest of
			<lb />
			the tenure&quot;. In respect of other companies which had convened the
			<lb />
			EGM for considering the resolution for his removal, CPM submitted
			<lb />
			resignations. But now by virtue of the impugned order, CPM will
			<lb />
			have to be reinstated even on the Board of companies from which
			<lb />
			he has resigned. This is why even the complainant companies have
			<lb />
			found it extremely difficult to support the order.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.13
			<lb />
			As an aside, we should record here, the words of
			<lb />
			gratitude (if any) expressed by CPM himself in the meeting of the
			<lb />
			Board of Tata Sons on 18.12.2012, immediately after the resolution
			<lb />
			appointing him as Executive Chairman was carried through
			<lb />
			unanimously. This is what CPM said in the Board Meeting dated
			<lb />
			18.12.2012:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Mr. Mistry responded by saying that -&quot;the past one
			<lb />
			year has been a great learning experience under the
			<lb />
			direct guidance of Mr. Ratan Tata. The TATA Group is
			<lb />
			founded on strict values. We will face all the ups
			<lb />
			and down, whatever may lie in our path. We are ready
			<lb />
			to face all the challenges that will come our way. The
			<lb />
			Board recognises the stellar contribution of Mr. Ratan
			<lb />
			Tata and wishes, to designate him Chairman Emeritus.
			<lb />
			We shall continue to seek his guidance on significant
			<lb />
			matters.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			17.14
			<lb />
			It is interesting to note that at the time of his
			<lb />
			appointment in December 2012, what CPM saw and acknowledged,
			<lb />
			was a &quot;great learning experience he had under the direct
			<lb />
			guidance of RNT&quot;, but at the time of departure in October 2016,
			<lb />
			what he saw was only a conduct for over 10 years, that was
			<lb />
			oppressive and prejudicial to the interests of the company and of
			<lb />
			the minority. NCLAT failed to take note of this, while granting reliefs
			<lb />
			neither sought for nor feasible in law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.15
			<lb />
			NCLAT appears to have granted the relief of
			<lb />
			reinstatement gratis without any foundation in pleadings, without
			<lb />
			any prayer and without any basis in law. By doing so, the NCLAT
			<lb />
			has forced upon the appellant an Executive Chairman, who now is
			<lb />
			unable to support his own reinstatement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.16
			<lb />
			The NCLAT has found the dismissal to be illegal and not
			<lb />
			a nullity. In law, a dismissal even if found to be wrongful and
			<lb />
			malafide is an effective dismissal and may give rise to a claim in
			<lb />
			damages. In Dr. S.B. Dutt vs. University of Delhi 18 this Court
			<lb />
			held:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The award held that the appellant had been dismissed
			<lb />
			wrongfully and malafide. Now, it is not consequential to
			<lb />
			such a finding that the dismissal was of no effect, for a
			<lb />
			wrongful and malafide dismissal is nonetheless an
			<lb />
			effective dismissal though it may give rise to a claim in
			<lb />
			damages. The award, no doubt, also said that the
			<lb />
			dismissal of the appellant was ultravires but as will be
			<lb />
			seen later, it did not thereby hold the act of dismissal to
			<lb />
			be a nullity and, therefore, of no effect.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			17.17
			<lb />
			It is significant that Sections 241 and 242 of the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 2013 do not specifically confer the power of
			<lb />
			reinstatement, nor we would add that there is any scope for holding
			<lb />
			that such a power to reinstate can be implied or inferred from any
			<lb />
			of the powers specifically conferred.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.18
			<lb />
			The following words at the end of subsection (1) of 242
			<lb />
			&quot;the Tribunal may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters
			<lb />
			complained of, make such order as it thinks fit&quot; cannot be
			<lb />
			interpreted as conferring on the Tribunal any implied power of
			<lb />
			directing reinstatement of a director or other officer of the company
			<lb />
			who has been removed from such office. These words can only be
			<lb />
			interpreted to mean as conferring the power to make such order as
			<lb />
			the Tribunal thinks fit, where the power to make such an order is
			<lb />
			not specifically conferred but is found necessary to remove any
			<lb />
			doubts and give effect to an order for which the power is specifically
			<lb />
			conferred. For instance, subsection (2) of Section 242 confers the
			<lb />
			power to make an order directing several actions. The words by
			<lb />
			which subsection (1) of Section 242 ends, supra can be held to
			<lb />
			mean the power to make such orders to bring an end, matters for
			<lb />
			which directions are given under subsection (2) of Section 242.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.19
			<lb />
			The architecture of Sections 241 and 242 does not permit
			<lb />
			the Tribunal to read into the Sections, a power to make an order
			<lb />
			(for reinstatement) which is barred by law vide Section 14 of the
			<lb />
			Specific Relief Act, 1963 with or without the amendment in 2018.
			<lb />
			Tribunal cannot make an order enforcing a contract which is
			<lb />
			dependent on personal qualifications such as those mentioned in
			<lb />
			Section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013. Moreover, it has been
			<lb />
			held in the case of Vaish Degree College (supra) that the general
			<lb />
			rule is that a contract of personal services is not specifically
			<lb />
			enforceable unless a person who is removed from service is (a) a
			<lb />
			public servant who has been dismissed from service in
			<lb />
			contravention of provisions of Article 311 of the Constitution of
			<lb />
			India; (b) dismissed under Industrial Law seeking reinstatement by
			<lb />
			Labour or Industrial Tribunal; and (c) terminated in breach of a
			<lb />
			mandatory obligation imposed by statute by a statutory body. The
			<lb />
			Court observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;17. On a consideration of the authorities mentioned
			<lb />
			above, it is, therefore, clear that a contract of personal
			<lb />
			service cannot ordinarily be specifically enforced and a
			<lb />
			court normally would not give a declaration that the
			<lb />
			contract subsists and the employee, even after having
			<lb />
			been removed from service can be deemed to be in
			<lb />
			service against the will and consent of the employer.
			<lb />
			This rule, however, is subject to three well recognised
			<lb />
			exceptions -(i) where a public servant is sought to be
			<lb />
			removed from service in contravention of the provisions
			<lb />
			of Article 311 of the Constitution of India; (ii) where a
			<lb />
			worker is sought to be reinstated on being dismissed
			<lb />
			under the Industrial Law; and (iii) where a statutory
			<lb />
			body acts in breach or violation of the mandatory
			<lb />
			provisions of the statute.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			17.20
			<lb />
			The position in law that a contract of personal services
			<lb />
			cannot be enforced by Court is a long standing principle of law and
			<lb />
			cannot be displaced by the existence of any implied power, though
			<lb />
			none is shown in the present case. This is described as the
			<lb />
			Principle of Legality 19 :
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;As statutes are not enacted in a vacuum, it is
			<lb />
			assumed that long standing principles of constitutional
			<lb />
			law and administrative law are not displaced by use of
			<lb />
			merely general words. This is styled as the principle of
			<lb />
			legality. In the words of SIR JOHN ROMILLY: &quot;The
			<lb />
			general words of the Act are not to be so construed as
			<lb />
			to alter the previous policy of the law, unless no sense
			<lb />
			or meaning can be applied to those words consistently
			<lb />
			with the intention of preserving the previous policy
			<lb />
			untouched.&quot;
			<lb />
			Since every new law involves some
			<lb />
			change the above statement of LORD ROMILLY must
			<lb />
			be applied with caution and should be normally
			<lb />
			confined to cases where &apos;the abrogation of a long
			<lb />
			standing rule of law is in question&apos;. There are many
			<lb />
			presumptions which an interpreter is entitled to raise
			<lb />
			which are not readily displaced merely by use of
			<lb />
			general words, e.g., an intention to bind the Crown or
			<lb />
			an intention to exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of
			<lb />
			superior courts will not be inferred merely by use of
			<lb />
			general words. It is an application of the same
			<lb />
			principle that unless there be clearest provision to the
			<lb />
			contrary, Parliament is presumed not to legislate
			<lb />
			contrary to rule of law which enforces &apos;minimum
			<lb />
			standard of fairness both substantive and procedural&apos;.
			<lb />
			Thus a statutory power though conferred in wide terms
			<lb />
			has certain implied limitations; provisions excluding
			<lb />
			challenge to an order have no application when the
			<lb />
			order is a nullity and a provision excluding an appeal
			<lb />
			against an order of a criminal court does not bar an
			<lb />
			appeal against an order which the court had no power
			<lb />
			to make. For the same reason, unless the statute
			<lb />
			expressly or by necessary implication provides
			<lb />
			otherwise an administrative decision does not take
			<lb />
			effect before it is communicated to the person
			<lb />
			concerned.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			17.21
			<lb />
			It is interesting to note that one of the grounds of
			<lb />
			challenge to the order of NCLAT, raised by SP group in their appeal
			<lb />
			C.A.No. 1802 of 2020 is that the Tribunal ought not to have granted
			<lb />
			the relief of reinstatement. In paragraph 4 of the Memorandum of
			<lb />
			Grounds of Civil Appeal C.A. No. 1802 of 2020, the complainant
			<lb />
			companies (SP group) have given a tabulation of the reliefs granted
			<lb />
			by the Tribunal and the reliefs that the Tribunal ought to have
			<lb />
			given instead. Para 4 of the memo of grounds of appeal along with a
			<lb />
			portion of the Table there under reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;4. Having correctly arrived at these findings, it is submitted that the Ld.
			<lb />
			NCLAT ought to have granted the reliefs sought. For ease of reference,
			<lb />
			the reliefs granted by the Ld. NCLAT under the various heads of
			<lb />
			oppression as against certain key reliefs sought by the Appellants,
			<lb />
			which the Ld. NCLAT has not granted and which the appellants are
			<lb />
			aggrieved by, are summarized in the tabular form below:

		<lb />

			Reliefs granted by the Ld.

			<lb />
			and the reliefs sought for

			Ousting of nominee of the SP Group as Director of Tata Sons
			<lb />
			R11 should be reinstated as

			Executive

			Director, for the rest of his tenure
			<lb />
			of Tata Sons and as Director of
			<lb />
			three Tata Group Companies
			<lb />
			from whose board he was

			removed.
			<lb />
			R11 has himself stated clearly

			of
			<lb />

			<lb />

		<p>
			17.22
			<lb />
			Thus the relief of reinstatement granted by the Tribunal,
			<lb />
			was too big a pill even for the complainant companies (and perhaps
			<lb />
			CPM) to swallow.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			Relief relating to Article 75
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			17.23
			<lb />
			The larger questions revolving around the attack to
			<lb />
			Article 75, particularly the question whether the very presence of
			<lb />
			such an article could be construed as oppressive and prejudicial to
			<lb />
			some members, will be dealt with in the next chapter concerning
			<lb />
			question of law No.3. But we shall consider here, the limited
			<lb />
			question whether the Tribunal could have granted a relief, that has
			<lb />
			the effect of sending Article 75 into comatose.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.24
			<lb />
			Actually, the relief in respect of Article 75, technically
			<lb />
			speaking, could not have been granted by NCLAT. The reason is
			<lb />
			that in the Company Petition as it was originally filed, there was no
			<lb />
			prayer challenging Article 75. It was only through an application for
			<lb />
			amendment dated 31.10.2017 that the complainant companies
			<lb />
			sought to incorporate a prayer as Clause M2 for striking off/
			<lb />
			deleting Article 75 on the ground that it is a tool in the hands of
			<lb />
			majority shareholders to oppress the minority. In the said
			<lb />
			application for amendment filed on 31.10.2017, the complainant
			<lb />
			companies sought to include five additional prayers, three of them
			<lb />
			as Clauses M1, M2 and M3, one of them as Clause F1 and the
			<lb />
			last as Clause G1. The prayer for striking off/deleting Article 75
			<lb />
			was sought to be included in Clause M2 of Para 153 of the main
			<lb />
			petition.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.25
			<lb />
			But what happened thereafter is quite interesting.
			<lb />
			Through a Memo dated 12.1.2018, the complainant companies
			<lb />
			sought to &quot;not press&quot; the prayers in Clauses (A), (B), (C), (F), (Q) and
			<lb />
			(R). In addition they sought to restrict the prayer in Clause M, as we
			<lb />
			have indicated in the table above. There was no indication in the
			<lb />
			Memo filed on 12.1.2018 as to whether the prayers included as M
			<lb />
			1, M2 and M3 inserted under the application for Amendment
			<lb />
			dated 31.10.2017 are to be retained, despite their prayer for
			<lb />
			restricting the claim made in Clause M.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.26
			<lb />
			It is true that the rigors of CPC and the Evidence Act are
			<lb />
			not be applicable to Tribunals/QuasiJudicial Authorities. These
			<lb />
			rigours do not even apply to Courts dealing with constitutional
			<lb />
			matters (refer the Explanation under Section 141 CPC).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.27
			<lb />
			Such a concession was incorporated in all Statutes by
			<lb />
			which quasi judicial Tribunals are created, solely with a view to
			<lb />
			avoid delay in the dispensation of justice. But instead of
			<lb />
			eliminating delay, it has eliminated discipline in pleadings
			<lb />
			and procedure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.28
			<lb />
			If it is a Civil Court, the Memo dated 12.1.2018 will be
			<lb />
			taken to have superseded whatever had been done till then. In such
			<lb />
			a case, there would have been complete lack of clarity whether the
			<lb />
			prayer included in Clause M2 survived despite the Memo
			<lb />
			restricting prayer made in the ClauseM.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.29
			<lb />
			Even if we take it that the memo dated 12012018
			<lb />
			restricted the prayer in clause M alone and not clause M2, NCLAT
			<lb />
			could not have muted Article 75 by holding that it cannot be
			<lb />
			invoked except in exceptional circumstances. This is for the reason
			<lb />
			that after all, Article 75 just provides for an exit option to the
			<lb />
			unwilling partner. Even traditionally, the law in England and in
			<lb />
			India is to pave the way for a safe and honourable exit, when 2
			<lb />
			persons in commercial relationship cannot coexist.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.30
			<lb />
			In this context, it will be useful to take note of the nature
			<lb />
			of the directions that could be issued by a Tribunal, in matters of
			<lb />
			this nature, as indicated in Clauses (a) to (m) of Subsection (2) of
			<lb />
			Section 242. Subsection (2) of Section 242 has been extracted by
			<lb />
			us elsewhere and it shows that what is listed in Clauses (a), (b), (c),
			<lb />
			(e), (f) and (g) of Subsection (2) of Section 242 are just the same as
			<lb />
			or similar to Clauses (a) to (f) of Section 402 of the 1956 Act.
			<lb />
			Clauses (d), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (l) of Subsection (2) of Section 242
			<lb />
			are new additions under the 2013 Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.31
			<lb />
			Fundamentally, the object for the achievement of which,
			<lb />
			the Tribunal is entitled to pass an Order under Section 242(1) of the
			<lb />
			2013 Act, remains just the same, as in the 1956 Act. The words
			<lb />
			&quot;the Tribunal may, with a view to bringing to an end the
			<lb />
			matters complained of, make such order as it thinks fit&quot;, found in
			<lb />
			the last limb of Subsection (2) of Section 397 of the 1956 Act, is
			<lb />
			also repeated in the last limb of Subsection (1) of Section 242 of
			<lb />
			the 2013 Act. These words also found a place in the last limb of
			<lb />
			Subsection (4) of Section 153C of the 1913 Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.32
			<lb />
			Even Section 210 of the English Companies Act of 1948
			<lb />
			used the very same words namely &quot;the Court may, with a view to
			<lb />
			bringing to an end the matters complained of, make such order as it
			<lb />
			thinks fit&quot;. Though the English Law made a paradigm shift from
			<lb />
			&apos;oppressive conduct&apos; to &apos;unfairly prejudicial conduct&apos; under the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 1985, the object to be kept in mind by the Court
			<lb />
			while passing an order under Section 461 of the English Companies
			<lb />
			Act, 1985 continued to be almost similar. Section 461(1) enabled
			<lb />
			the Court to make &quot;such order as it thinks fit for giving relief in
			<lb />
			respect of the matters complained of&quot;. Section 996 of the English
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 2006 retained the very same wordings.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.33
			<lb />
			Therefore, despite the law relating to oppression and
			<lb />
			mismanagement undergoing several changes, the object that a
			<lb />
			Tribunal should keep in mind while passing an order in an
			<lb />
			application complaining of oppression and mismanagement, has
			<lb />
			remained the same for decades. This object is that the Tribunal, by
			<lb />
			its order, should bring to an end the matters complained of.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.34
			<lb />
			In other words the purpose of an order both under the
			<lb />
			English Law and under the Indian Law, irrespective of whether the
			<lb />
			regime is one of &quot;oppressive conduct&quot; or &quot;unfairly prejudicial
			<lb />
			conduct&quot; or a mere &quot;prejudicial conduct&quot;, is to bring to an end the
			<lb />
			matters complained of by providing a solution. The object cannot
			<lb />
			be to provide a remedy worse than the disease. The object should be
			<lb />
			to put an end to the matters complained of and not to put an end to
			<lb />
			the company itself, forsaking the interests of other stakeholders. It
			<lb />
			is relevant to point out that once upon a time, the provisions for
			<lb />
			relief against oppression and mismanagement were construed as
			<lb />
			weapons in the armoury of the shareholders, which when
			<lb />
			brandished in terrorem, were more potent than when actually used
			<lb />
			to strike with. While such a position is certainly not desirable, they
			<lb />
			cannot today be taken to the other extreme where the tail can wag
			<lb />
			the dog.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.35
			<lb />
			The Tribunal should always keep in mind the purpose for
			<lb />
			which remedies are made available under these provisions, before
			<lb />
			granting relief or issuing directions. It is on the touchstone of the
			<lb />
			objective behind these provisions that the correctness of the four
			<lb />
			reliefs granted by the Tribunal should be tested. If so done, it will be
			<lb />
			clear that NCLAT could not have granted the reliefs of (i)
			<lb />
			reinstatement of CPM (ii) restriction on the right to invoke Article 75
			<lb />
			(iii) restraining RNT and the Nominee Directors from taking
			<lb />
			decisions in advance and (iv) setting aside the conversion of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons into a private company.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			18. Question 3
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			18.1
			<lb />
			The third question of law to be considered is as to
			<lb />
			whether NCLAT could have, in law, muted the power of the
			<lb />
			company under Article 75 of the Articles of Association, to demand
			<lb />
			any member to transfer his shares, by injuncting the company from
			<lb />
			exercising the rights under the Article, even while refusing to set
			<lb />
			aside the Article.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.2
			<lb />
			Article 75 of the Articles of Association reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot; 75. Company&apos;s Power of Transfer
			<lb />
			The Company may at any time by Special Resolution
			<lb />
			resolve that any holder of Ordinary shares do transfer
			<lb />
			his Ordinary shares. Such member would thereupon be
			<lb />
			deemed to have served the Company with a salenotice
			<lb />
			in respect of his Ordinary shares in accordance with
			<lb />
			Article 58 hereof, and all the ancillary and consequential
			<lb />
			provisions of these Articles shall apply with respect to
			<lb />
			the completion of the sale of the said shares. Notice in
			<lb />
			writing of such resolution shall be given to the member
			<lb />
			affected thereby. For the purpose of this Article any
			<lb />
			person entitled to transfer an Ordinary share under
			<lb />
			Article 69 hereof shall be deemed the holder of such
			<lb />
			share.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			18.3
			<lb />
			At the outset it should be pointed out that the
			<lb />
			complainant companies did not make a grievance out of Article 75
			<lb />
			on the ground that it had been misused in the past and that such
			<lb />
			misuse tantamount to conduct oppressive or prejudicial to the
			<lb />
			interests of some of the members. The sine qua non for invoking
			<lb />
			Section 241 is that the affairs of the Company should have been
			<lb />
			conducted or are being conducted in a manner oppressive or
			<lb />
			prejudicial to some of the members. No single instance even of
			<lb />
			invocation of Article 75, leave alone misuse, is averred in the main
			<lb />
			company petition or in the application for amendment. Therefore,
			<lb />
			NCLAT could not have and should not have made Article 75
			<lb />
			completely ineffective by passing an order of restraint.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.4
			<lb />
			As a matter of fact, NCLAT has agreed, on first principles,
			<lb />
			that it has no jurisdiction to declare any of the Articles of
			<lb />
			Association illegal. After having set a benchmark correctly, NCLAT
			<lb />
			neutralised Article 75 merely on the basis of likelihood of misuse.
			<lb />
			Section 241(1)(a) provides for a remedy, only in respect of past and
			<lb />
			present conduct or past and present continuous conduct. NCLAT
			<lb />
			has stretched Section 241(1)(a) to cover the likelihood of a future
			<lb />
			bad conduct, which is impermissible in law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.5
			<lb />
			That Articles of Association of a company constitute a
			<lb />
			contract among shareholders, is the bedrock of Company Law. In
			<lb />
			fact, Article 75 was not an invention of the recent origin in Tata
			<lb />
			Sons. It has been there for nearly a century in one form or the
			<lb />
			other. As we have pointed out elsewhere, the Company was
			<lb />
			incorporated in the year 1917 and S.P. Group acquired shares
			<lb />
			nearly after 50 years in the year 1965. Even at that time Article 75
			<lb />
			was in existence in a different form. After 1965, Article 75
			<lb />
			underwent several rounds of amendments, to which the S.P. Group,
			<lb />
			CPM&apos;s father and CPM were parties. CPM himself was a party to an
			<lb />
			amendment made to Article 75 on 13.09.2000. The Article in its
			<lb />
			present form was made only on 13.09.2000 and the amendment
			<lb />
			was unanimously carried through in the presence of and with the
			<lb />
			consent of CPM.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.6
			<lb />
			A person who willingly became a shareholder and thereby
			<lb />
			subscribed to the Articles of Association and who was a willing and
			<lb />
			consenting party to the amendments carried out to those Articles,
			<lb />
			cannot later on turn around and challenge those Articles. The same
			<lb />
			would tantamount to requesting the Court to rewrite a contract to
			<lb />
			which he became a party with eyes wide open.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.7
			<lb />
			It is not as though CPM or his father who was also a
			<lb />
			Director for nearly 25 years, were not aware of or blind to the
			<lb />
			existence of Article 75. In fact, in the application for amendment
			<lb />
			filed by the complainant companies on 31.10.2017, seeking to
			<lb />
			incorporate a challenge to Article 75, the complainant companies
			<lb />
			stated as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;…In as much as no occasion had arisen in
			<lb />
			exercise of the said Article, the petitioners i.e.,
			<lb />
			Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had taken a conscious
			<lb />
			decision not to challenge the same. Respondent
			<lb />
			Nos. 1 and 2 now foresee a real and immediate threat
			<lb />
			of this Article being misused&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The above pleading on the part of the complainant companies was
			<lb />
			sufficient to throw the challenge to Article 75 out, as it did not
			<lb />
			correlate to an actual conduct but the possibility of a future
			<lb />
			conduct. Section 241 is not intended to discipline a Management in
			<lb />
			respect of a possible future conduct.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.8
			<lb />
			It is no doubt true that the Tribunal has the power under
			<lb />
			Section 242 to set aside any amendment to the Articles that takes
			<lb />
			away recognised proprietary rights of shareholders. But this is on
			<lb />
			the premise that the bringing up of amendment itself was a conduct
			<lb />
			that was oppressive or prejudicial.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.9
			<lb />
			It was contended that Article 75 was repugnant to
			<lb />
			Sections 235 and 236 of the Companies Act, 2013. We do not know
			<lb />
			how these provisions would apply. Section 235 deals with a scheme
			<lb />
			or contract involving transfer of shares in a Company called the
			<lb />
			transferor company, to another called the transferee company.
			<lb />
			Similarly, Section 236 deals with a case where an acquirer acquired
			<lb />
			or a person acting in concert with such acquirer becomes the
			<lb />
			registered holder of 90% of the equity share capital of the Company,
			<lb />
			by virtue of amalgamation, share exchange, conversion of securities
			<lb />
			etc. These provisions have no relevance to the case on hand.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.10
			<lb />
			Even the contention revolving around Section 58(2) is
			<lb />
			wholly unsustainable, as Section 58(2) deals with securities or other
			<lb />
			interests of any member of a Public Company.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.11
			<lb />
			Therefore, the order of NCLAT tinkering with the power
			<lb />
			available under Article 75 of the Articles of Association is wholly
			<lb />
			unsustainable. It is needless to point out that if the relief granted
			<lb />
			by NCLAT itself is contrary to law, the prayer of the S.P. Group in
			<lb />
			their Appeal C.A. No.1802 of 2020 asking for more, is nothing but a
			<lb />
			request for aggravating the illegality.

			19. Question 4
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			19.1
			<lb />
			The fourth question of law to be considered is whether
			<lb />
			the characterisation by the Tribunal, of the affirmative voting rights
			<lb />
			available under Article 121 to the Directors nominated by the
			<lb />
			Trusts in terms of Article 104B, as oppressive and prejudicial, is
			<lb />
			justified especially after the challenge to these Articles have been
			<lb />
			given up expressly and whether the Tribunal could have granted a
			<lb />
			direction to RNT and the Nominee directors virtually nullifying the
			<lb />
			effect of these Articles.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.2
			<lb />
			In the Company Petition as it was originally filed, the
			<lb />
			complainant companies sought a prayer in Paragraph 153(M) to
			<lb />
			strike down Articles 86, 104B, 118, 121 and 121A in entirety and to
			<lb />
			strike off one portion of Article 124. These Articles (other than
			<lb />
			Article 118, which is extracted elsewhere) read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;86. Quorum at General Meetings

		</item>

			<lb />
			any proposed investment by the Company in

			<lb />
			representative on how to exercise the Company&apos;s voting
			<lb />
			rights.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation:
			<lb />
			the term &quot;Tata Company&quot; used in
			<lb />
			this article shall, as the context requires, mean each or
			<lb />
			any of the 4 following companies&quot;
			<lb />
			Tata Consultancy Services ltd., Tata Steel Limited, Tata
			<lb />
			Motors Limited, Tata Capital Ltd., Tata Chemicals Ltd.,
			<lb />
			Tata Power Company Ltd., Tata Global Beverages Ltd.,
			<lb />
			The Indian Hotels Company Ltd., Trent Limited, Tata
			<lb />
			Teleservices (Maharashtra) Limited, Tata Industries
			<lb />
			Limited,
			<lb />
			Tata
			<lb />
			Teleservices
			<lb />
			Limited,
			<lb />
			Tata
			<lb />
			Communications Limited, Titan Company Limited and
			<lb />
			Infiniti Retail Limited and any other Company in which
			<lb />
			the Company (or its subsidiaries) holds twenty percent
			<lb />
			or more of the paid up share capital and whose name is
			<lb />
			notified in writing to the Company by the Directors
			<lb />
			nominated under Article 104B&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			19.3
			<lb />
			But through a Memo dated 12.01.2018, the complainant
			<lb />
			companies restricted the relief prayed in Paragraph 153(M) to the
			<lb />
			extent as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			the necessity of affirmative voting of the majority of
			<lb />
			the Directors nominated by the Trusts, which are majority of
			<lb />
			shareholders be deleted;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) the petitioners be entitled to proportionate
			<lb />
			representation on the Board of Directors of Respondent No.1;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) the petitioners be entitled to a representation on all
			<lb />
			committees formed by the Board of Directors of Respondent
			<lb />
			No.1; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) the Articles of Association be amended accordingly.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			19.4
			<lb />
			Therefore, what was actually sought by the complainant
			<lb />
			companies was the deletion of the Article that necessitated the
			<lb />
			affirmative voting right of the majority of the Directors nominated
			<lb />
			by the two Trusts. There was no prayer for restraining RNT and the
			<lb />
			nominee Directors of the Trusts from taking any decision in
			<lb />
			advance.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.5
			<lb />
			In fact, even the complainant companies are not happy
			<lb />
			about the relief so granted by NCLAT. In the Table given in
			<lb />
			Paragraph 4 of their Memorandum of Appeal in C.A.No.1802 of
			<lb />
			2020, the complainant companies themselves seek a modification of
			<lb />
			the relief so granted. This Table found below Paragraph 4 of the
			<lb />
			Memorandum of Grounds of appeal in C.A.No.1802 of 2020 reads
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<table>
			Reliefs granted by the Ld.
			<lb />
			NCLAT
			<lb />
			Reliefs that ought to have been
			<lb />
			granted by the Ld. NCLAT in
			<lb />
			light of the findings rendered
			<lb />
			and the reliefs sought for
			<lb />
			Abuse of Articles culminating in the removal of R11
			<lb />
			R2 and nominee of the Tata Trusts
			<lb />
			should desist from taking decisions
			<lb />
			in advance of Board meetings and
			<lb />
			i.
			<lb />
			The direction ought not to have
			<lb />
			been only against the nominee
			<lb />
			of Tata Trusts and R2 but
			<lb />
			shareholder meetings of Tata Sons.
			<lb />
			against the Trustees of the
			<lb />
			majority shareholders who
			<lb />
			even though not on the Board
			<lb />
			of Tata Sons, were interfering
			<lb />
			with the decision making
			<lb />
			processes of the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors, and therefore, the
			<lb />
			reliefs ought to have been
			<lb />
			granted
			<lb />
			against
			<lb />
			all
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Trustees of the Tata Trusts.
			<lb />
			ii.
			<lb />
			Further in view of the fact that
			<lb />
			such interference was being
			<lb />
			based on the existence of an
			<lb />
			affirmative vote under Article
			<lb />
			121, it would totally be
			<lb />
			anomalous
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			a
			<lb />
			Board
			<lb />
			managed Company if every
			<lb />
			decision
			<lb />
			required
			<lb />
			an
			<lb />
			affirmative vote of the Trust
			<lb />
			Nominee Directors and Tata
			<lb />
			Sons would virtually become a
			<lb />
			majority shareholder managed
			<lb />
			company rather than a Board
			<lb />
			managed
			<lb />
			company
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			contemplated under Article
			<lb />
			122(b). Article 121A of the
			<lb />
			Articles specifies certain areas
			<lb />
			where consent of the majority
			<lb />
			shareholder was necessary
			<lb />
			and therefore, the relief that
			<lb />
			ought to have been granted
			<lb />
			was to restrict the applicability
			<lb />
			of the affirmative vote to the
			<lb />
			nominee of the Tata Trusts on
			<lb />
			the matters covered under
			<lb />
			Article 121A and a a similar
			<lb />
			right ought to have been
			<lb />
			conferred on the nominee
			<lb />
			directors of the minority
			<lb />
			shareholder -the SP Group.
			<lb />
		</table>

		<p>
			19.6
			<lb />
			But for the fact that the complainant companies have
			<lb />
			also come up with an appeal, we would have simply set aside the
			<lb />
			order of restraint passed by NCLAT against RNT and nominee
			<lb />
			Directors, on the ground that there was no such prayer. Now that
			<lb />
			S.P. Group has come up with an appeal seeking an amplification or
			<lb />
			modulation of the relief so granted, we shall deal with the challenge
			<lb />
			to the affirmative voting rights.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			Affirmative voting rights
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			19.7
			<lb />
			Under Article 104B, Sir Dorabjee Tata Trust and Sir
			<lb />
			Ratan Tata Trust, acting jointly, shall have a right to nominate
			<lb />
			1/3 rd of the prevailing number of Directors on the Board, so long as
			<lb />
			the Trusts own and hold, in the aggregate, at least 40% of the paid
			<lb />
			up share capital. Article 121 provides that the matters which
			<lb />
			require to be decided by a majority of the Directors, shall require
			<lb />
			the affirmative vote of the majority of Directors appointed under
			<lb />
			Article 104B.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.8
			<lb />
			Article 121A contains the list of matters to be resolved by
			<lb />
			the Board of Directors. One of the items included therein is &quot;any
			<lb />
			matter affecting the share holding of the Tata Trusts in the
			<lb />
			Company…&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.9
			<lb />
			As seen from the Table under Paragraph 4 of the
			<lb />
			Memorandum of appeal filed by the S.P. Group in C.A.No.1802 of
			<lb />
			2020, they are not seeking, even now, the scrapping of the
			<lb />
			affirmative voting rights. Interestingly, S.P. Group, through their
			<lb />
			Memo dated 12.01.2018 wanted the deletion of the Article providing
			<lb />
			for affirmative voting right. But as per the Table under Paragraph 4
			<lb />
			of the Memo of their appeal in C.A.No.1802 of 2020, the
			<lb />
			complainant companies have now reconciled themselves to the
			<lb />
			unavoidability of affirmative voting rights but all that they want is
			<lb />
			that the applicability of affirmative voting right should be restricted
			<lb />
			to the matters covered by Article 121A. In addition, the complainant
			<lb />
			companies want a similar affirmative right to be conferred on the
			<lb />
			nominee Directors of the S.P. Group.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.10
			<lb />
			The swing that the S.P. Group has taken in their position
			<lb />
			relating to affirmative voting rights is quite funny. To begin with,
			<lb />
			they sought a prayer for striking off Article 121 in its entirety. Later
			<lb />
			they restricted their relief, by the Memo dated 12.01.2018, to the
			<lb />
			deletion of &quot;the necessity of affirmative voting rights&quot;. But now they
			<lb />
			are fine with the existence of affirmative voting rights for the
			<lb />
			majority in respect of matters covered by Article 121A, but want a
			<lb />
			similar right in favour of the nominee directors of the S.P. Group.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.11
			<lb />
			The frequent change of position that S.P. Group has
			<lb />
			taken and the relief that they now seek, raises a doubt whether it is
			<lb />
			actually a fight on principles. If affirmative voting rights are bad in
			<lb />
			principle, we do not know how they may become good, if conferred
			<lb />
			on S.P. Group also.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.12
			<lb />
			Drawing our attention to Sections 135, 149, 151, 161
			<lb />
			166 and 177 of the Companies Act, 2013, it was argued on behalf of
			<lb />
			SP group that there is a sea change in the law, after the advent of
			<lb />
			the 2013 Act and that today a paradigm shift has taken place from
			<lb />
			&apos;corporate majority/democracy&apos; to &apos;corporate governance&apos; and that
			<lb />
			every action of the Board has to pass the test of fairness. It is
			<lb />
			further contended that Directors have a fiduciary responsibility with
			<lb />
			the highest level of duty and that the same cannot be outsourced.
			<lb />
			According to the SP group, the Directors, once appointed, owe their
			<lb />
			allegiance only to the company and not to their nominators.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.13
			<lb />
			At first blush, these arguments, almost bordering on
			<lb />
			romantic idealism, appear very attractive. But on a deeper scrutiny,
			<lb />
			they are bound to get grounded. If we have a look at the history of
			<lb />
			evolution of corporate enterprises, it can be seen that there are 3
			<lb />
			time periods through which development of corporate entities have
			<lb />
			passed. In the first period, large corporate houses were established
			<lb />
			by individuals with their own funds and those individuals and their
			<lb />
			families controlled both ownership and management of these
			<lb />
			enterprises. In the second time period, when professionalism
			<lb />
			became the &apos;Taraka mantra&apos;, families which promoted enterprises,
			<lb />
			retained ownership, but appointed professional managers to run
			<lb />
			the show. Thus ownership got divested from management. In the
			<lb />
			third time period, social participation increased by leaps and
			<lb />
			bounds through public issues and listing. This increased the social
			<lb />
			accountability and social responsibility of corporate entities. Every
			<lb />
			time a historical shift/change took place, the legal regime had to
			<lb />
			undergo a change, albeit at snail&apos;s pace.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.14
			<lb />
			As a matter of fact, the Companies Act, 1956 suffered 24
			<lb />
			amendments. Major amendments were made first in 1988 and then
			<lb />
			in 2002, respectively on the basis of the recommendations of the
			<lb />
			Sachar Committee and the Report of the Eradi Committee. On
			<lb />
			August 4, 2004, the Ministry of Company Affairs, published a
			<lb />
			Concept Paper on Company Law on its website, after which, the
			<lb />
			Government constituted an Expert Committee under the
			<lb />
			Chairmanship of Dr. J.J. Irani 20 . The mandate of the Committee
			<lb />
			was to make recommendations on certain issues, one of which was
			<lb />
			&quot;protecting the interests of stakeholders and investors, including
			<lb />
			small investors&quot;. This committee&apos;s report crystallised into
			<lb />
			20 Incidentally J.J. Irani was the Chairman of Tata Sons for sometime
			<lb />
			Companies Bill, 2009, which later became Companies Bill, 2011
			<lb />
			and then Companies Act, 2013.
			<lb />

		<p>

			<lb />

		</item>

		<item>
			(ix) A detailed Code of conduct for independent

			with a detailed compliance Report on Corporate
			<lb />
			Governance.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(xiv) After the advent of the Companies Act, 2013, SEBI
			<lb />
			Regulations were also amended, inserting Clause 49 in
			<lb />
			the Listing Agreement, to enforce compliance with
			<lb />
			Corporate Governance standards.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.15
			<lb />
			But it must be remembered that the shift under the
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 2013 is focused on listed and unlisted public
			<lb />
			companies. The requirement under Section 149(4) to have at least
			<lb />
			onethird of the total number of Directors as independent Directors
			<lb />
			applies only to every listed public company. The requirement under
			<lb />
			Section 151 to have one Director elected by small shareholders is
			<lb />
			also applicable only to listed companies. The requirement to
			<lb />
			constitute an Audit Committee in terms of Section 177(1), a
			<lb />
			Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Stakeholders
			<lb />
			Relationship Committee in terms of Section 178(1) are also only on
			<lb />
			listed public companies.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.16
			<lb />
			Insofar as Tata Sons is concerned, the Articles of
			<lb />
			Association of the Company continue to contain the prescribed
			<lb />
			restrictions which make it a private company within the definition
			<lb />
			of the expression under Section 2(68). Therefore, the provisions
			<lb />
			discussed above do not apply to Tata Sons. Yet Tata Sons has a
			<lb />
			Board packed with many people who are ranked outsiders. If the
			<lb />
			idea was to run Tata Sons purely as a family business, RNT need
			<lb />
			not have stepped down from the Chairmanship. Today nobody
			<lb />
			wants to step down from any office, except if afflicted by brain
			<lb />
			stroke or sun stroke. As we have seen from the pleadings, the Tata
			<lb />
			Group was founded by Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata (18391904). It
			<lb />
			was first established as a private trading firm in 1868 and was later
			<lb />
			incorporated as a private company on 8.11.1917 under Section
			<lb />
			2(13) of the Companies Act, 1913. Later two Trusts were created,
			<lb />
			one in the year 1919 under the name Sir Ratan Tata Trust and
			<lb />
			another in 1952 under the name Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. It was only
			<lb />
			in 1965 that S.P. Group acquired 48 preference shares and 40
			<lb />
			equity shares, from a member of Tata Sons named Mrs. Rodabeh
			<lb />
			Sawhney. Shri Pallonji Mistry, the father of CPM was inducted as a
			<lb />
			NonExecutive Director on 25.06.1980, though the Articles of
			<lb />
			Association did not confer any right of Directorship upon the S.P
			<lb />
			Group. He stepped down from this position in December, 2004.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, CPM was appointed as NonExecutive Director on
			<lb />
			10.08.2006. Ever since the establishment of the Tata Group in
			<lb />
			1868, there have only been six persons who became the Chairmen
			<lb />
			of the Group. While five of them namely Jamshedji Tata, Sir Dorab
			<lb />
			Tata, Nowroji Saklatwala, JRD Tata and Ratan Tata belonged to the
			<lb />
			same family, the sixth person namely CPM was inducted as
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman by Resolution dated 18.12.2012 with effect
			<lb />
			from 29.12.2012. Before the said appointment, CPM was identified
			<lb />
			by a Selection Committee which comprised of the nominees of the
			<lb />
			two Tata Trusts. This Selection Committee identified CPM as a
			<lb />
			successor to RNT as Chairman and appointed him first as Executive
			<lb />
			Deputy Chairman for a period of five years form 1.04.2012 till
			<lb />
			31.03.2017, subject to the approval of the General Body. The
			<lb />
			General meeting of the shareholders, held on 1.8.2012 approved the
			<lb />
			appointment of CPM as Executive Deputy Chairman and also left it
			<lb />
			to the Board to redesignate him as Chairman. This is how the
			<lb />
			Board, in its meeting dated 18.12.2012 redesignated CPM as
			<lb />
			Executive Chairman.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.17
			<lb />
			If the argument relating to corporate governance is
			<lb />
			carefully scrutinized in the context of the fact: (i) that a large
			<lb />
			industrial house whose origin and creation was familial, was willing
			<lb />
			to handover the mantle of heading the entire empire to a person like
			<lb />
			CPM (a rank outsider to the family); and (ii) that the identification of
			<lb />
			CPM as the successor to RNT was done by the very same nominees
			<lb />
			of the two Tata Trusts (who is now accused of interference), then it
			<lb />
			will be clear that Tata Group was guided by the principle of
			<lb />
			Corporate Governance (even without a statutory compulsion) and
			<lb />
			not by tightfisted control of the management of the affairs of the
			<lb />
			Group.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.18
			<lb />
			The provisions of sections 135, 149, 151, 166 and 177
			<lb />
			around which the argument relating to corporate governance is
			<lb />
			fantasised, cannot advance the case of the SP group. Section 135
			<lb />
			deals with corporate social responsibility, which in any case is more
			<lb />
			pronounced in this company due to the fact that charitable trusts
			<lb />
			hold majority of the shares. Section 149 deals with the requirement
			<lb />
			to have Directors, section 151 provides for appointment of a
			<lb />
			Director elected by small shareholders, section 166 enumerates the
			<lb />
			duties of directors and section 177 and 178 speak of some
			<lb />
			committees. Some of these provisions such as sections 151, 177
			<lb />
			and 178 apply only to listed public companies. Yet, Tata Sons have
			<lb />
			complied with sections 177 and 178 by constituting necessary
			<lb />
			committees.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.19
			<lb />
			It was contended that a Director of a Company is to act
			<lb />
			in good faith in order to promote the objects of the Company for the
			<lb />
			benefit of all the stakeholders and that he is in a fiduciary capacity
			<lb />
			visavis the company. The affirmative voting rights, according to
			<lb />
			S.P.Group, disabled the nominee Directors from acting
			<lb />
			independently in the best interests of the company and its
			<lb />
			stakeholders and that once appointed, the loyalty of the nominee
			<lb />
			Directors should be to the Company and not solely to the Trusts
			<lb />
			which nominated him. It was further contended that under Articles
			<lb />
			121, 121A and 122, Tata Sons was to be a Board managed
			<lb />
			Company and that the protective rights conferred under Article 121
			<lb />
			were intended to take care of the interests of the Tata Trust, in case
			<lb />
			they became a minority.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.20
			<lb />
			According to the S.P. Group, the preconsultation/pre
			<lb />
			clearance requirement disabled the Directors from effectively
			<lb />
			discharging their fiduciary duties under Section 166, violated the
			<lb />
			Secretarial Standards required to be adhered to under Section
			<lb />
			118(10) and rendered nugatory, the scheme of Section 149 which
			<lb />
			requires 1/3 rd of the members of the Board to be independent
			<lb />
			Directors.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.21
			<lb />
			But all the above contentions are completely devoid of
			<lb />
			any substance, for they tend to overlook one basic fact namely that
			<lb />
			Tata Sons is not a company engaged either in any manufacturing
			<lb />
			activity or in any trading activity. As per the pleadings, on which
			<lb />
			there is no dispute, Tata Sons is a Principal Investment Holding
			<lb />
			Company and is a promoter of Tata Companies. Tata Sons holds a
			<lb />
			controlling interest in all the operating companies of the Tata
			<lb />
			Group. Other than being the Principal Investment Holding
			<lb />
			Company, Tata Sons, by itself is not engaged in any direct business
			<lb />
			activity.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.22
			<lb />
			As we have indicated in the beginning, around 66% of the
			<lb />
			equity share capital of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic Trusts,
			<lb />
			including Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Rata Tata Trust. It is
			<lb />
			claimed that these charitable Trusts support education, health,
			<lb />
			livelihood generation and Art &amp; Culture.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.23
			<lb />
			If we take these two important factors into consideration
			<lb />
			namely: (i) that Tata Sons is only a Principal Investment Holding
			<lb />
			Company; and (ii) that the majority shareholders of Tata Sons are
			<lb />
			only philanthropic charitable Trusts, it will be clear that the
			<lb />
			Directors nominated by the Trusts are not like any other Directors
			<lb />
			who get appointed in a General Meeting of the Company in terms of
			<lb />
			Section 152(2) of the Act. In fact it is a paradox to claim that by
			<lb />
			virtue of Subsections (2) and (3) of Section 166, every Director of a
			<lb />
			Company is duty bound to act in good faith in order to promote the
			<lb />
			objects of the company for the benefits of its members and in the
			<lb />
			best interests of all the stakeholders as well as environment and a
			<lb />
			duty to exercise independent judgment, and yet mandate the
			<lb />
			appointment of independent Directors under Section 149(4). If all
			<lb />
			Directors are required under Section 166(3) to exercise independent
			<lb />
			Judgment, we do not know why there is a separate provision in
			<lb />
			Section 149(4) for every listed Public Company to have at least 1/3 rd
			<lb />
			of the total number of Directors as independent Directors. We do
			<lb />
			not also know whether the prescription in Section 149(4) is a tacit
			<lb />
			acknowledgment that all the Directors appointed in a General
			<lb />
			meeting under Section 152(2) may not be independent in practice,
			<lb />
			though they may be required to be so in theory.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.24
			<lb />
			A person nominated by a charitable Trust, to be a
			<lb />
			Director in a company in which the Trust holds shares, also holds a
			<lb />
			fiduciary relationship with the Trust and fiduciary duty towards the
			<lb />
			nameless, faceless beneficiaries of those Trusts. As we have pointed
			<lb />
			out elsewhere, the history of evolution of the corporate world shows
			<lb />
			that it has moved from the (i) familial to (ii) contractual and
			<lb />
			managerial to (iii) a regime of social accountability and
			<lb />
			responsibility. This is why Section 166(2) also talks about the duty
			<lb />
			of a Director to protect environment, in addition to his duties to (i)
			<lb />
			promote the objects of the company for the benefit of its members
			<lb />
			as a whole; and (ii) act in the best interests of the company, its
			<lb />
			employees, the shareholders and the community. It is common
			<lb />
			knowledge that some of the industries which take good care of its
			<lb />
			shareholders and employees also run polluting industries.
			<lb />
			Therefore there is always a conflict, a tug of war between competing
			<lb />
			interests and statutes cannot resolve these conflicts effectively.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.25
			<lb />
			Affirmative voting rights for the nominees of institutions
			<lb />
			which hold majority of shares in companies have always been
			<lb />
			accepted as a global norm. As a matter of fact the affirmative voting
			<lb />
			rights conferred by Article 121 of the Articles of Association, confers
			<lb />
			only a limited right upon the Directors appointed by the Trusts
			<lb />
			under Article 104B. Article 121 speaks only about the manner in
			<lb />
			which matters before any meeting of the Board shall be decided. If
			<lb />
			it is a General Meeting of Tata Sons, the representatives of the two
			<lb />
			Trusts will actually have a greater say as the Trusts have 66% of
			<lb />
			shares in Tata Sons. Therefore, if we apply Section 152(2) strictly,
			<lb />
			the Trusts which own 66% of the paid up capital of Tata Sons will
			<lb />
			be entitled to pack the Board with their own men as Directors. But
			<lb />
			under Article 104B, only a minimum guarantee is provided to the
			<lb />
			two Trusts, by ensuring that the Trusts will have at least 1/3 rd of
			<lb />
			the Directors, as nominated by them so long as they hold 40% in
			<lb />
			the aggregate of the paid up share capital.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.26
			<lb />
			Section 43 of the Companies Act (which is equivalent of
			<lb />
			Section 86 of the 1956 Act), recognises two types of share capital of
			<lb />
			a company limited by shares. They are (i) equity share capital; and
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) preference share capital. Again equity share capital can be of
			<lb />
			two kinds namely, (i) those with voting rights; and (ii) those with
			<lb />
			differential rights as to dividend, voting or otherwise in accordance
			<lb />
			with such rules as may be prescribed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.27
			<lb />
			Section 47(1)(b) of the 2013 Act (equivalent to Section
			<lb />
			87(1)(b) of the 1956 Act), declares that the rights of a member of a
			<lb />
			company limited by shares, shall be in proportion to his share in
			<lb />
			the paid up equity share capital of the company. This right is
			<lb />
			subject to the provisions of Section 43, Section 50(2) and Section
			<lb />
			188(1) of the 2013 Act. The restrictions under Sections 43, 50(2)
			<lb />
			and 188(1) respectively are, (i) shares with differential voting rights;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) disentitlement to voting rights, of a member who has not paid
			<lb />
			the unpaid share capital; and (iii) the disentitlement of a member to
			<lb />
			vote on a resolution for the approval of any contract entered into by
			<lb />
			the company with a related party.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.28
			<lb />
			Under Section 10(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association bind the company and the members thereof
			<lb />
			to the same extent as if they respectively had been signed by the
			<lb />
			company and by each member. However, this is subject to the
			<lb />
			provisions of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.29
			<lb />
			Article 94 of the Articles of Association of Tata Sons is in
			<lb />
			tune with Section 47(1)(b), as it says that upon a poll, the voting
			<lb />
			rights of every member, whether present in person or by proxy
			<lb />
			shall be in proportion to his share of the paid up capital of the
			<lb />
			company. Therefore, a shareholder or a group of shareholders who
			<lb />
			constitute majority, can always seek to be in the driving seat by
			<lb />
			reserving affirmative voting rights. So long as these special rights
			<lb />
			are incorporated in the Articles of Association and so long as they
			<lb />
			are not in contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, the
			<lb />
			same cannot be attacked on these grounds.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.30
			<lb />
			Coming to the argument revolving around the duty of a
			<lb />
			Director, it is necessary that we balance the duty of a Director,
			<lb />
			under Section 166(2) to act in the best interests of the company, its
			<lb />
			employees, the shareholders, the community and the protection of
			<lb />
			environment, with the duties of a Director nominated by an
			<lb />
			Institution including a public charitable trust. They have fiduciary
			<lb />
			duty towards 2 companies, one of which is the shareholder which
			<lb />
			nominated them and the other, is the company to whose Board they
			<lb />
			are nominated. If this is understood, there will be no confusion
			<lb />
			about the validity of the affirmative voting rights. What is ordained
			<lb />
			under Section 166(2) is a combination of private interest and public
			<lb />
			interest. But what is required of a Director nominated by a
			<lb />
			charitable Trust is pure, unadulterated public interest. Therefore,
			<lb />
			there is nothing abhorring about the validity of the affirmative
			<lb />
			voting rights.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.31
			<lb />
			Relying upon the decision of this Court in Vodafone
			<lb />
			International Holdings BV vs. Union Of India 21 , it was contended
			<lb />
			that a minority investor has what is called &quot;participative rights,
			<lb />
			which is a subsect of protective rights&quot; and that these participative
			<lb />
			rights enable the minority to overcome the presumption of
			<lb />
			consolidation of operations or assets by the controlling shareholder.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.32
			<lb />
			But the decision in Vodafone (supra) arose under a
			<lb />
			completely different context. It was a tax dispute in relation to
			<lb />
			capital gains arising from the sale of share capital of a company
			<lb />
			resident for tax purposes in Cayman Islands, on the basis that it
			<lb />
			held underlying Indian assets. It was in that context that this Court
			<lb />
			analysed the independent legal existence of a subsidiary and held
			<lb />
			that even if directors are appointed at the behest of the parent
			<lb />
			company or removable by the parent company, such directors of the
			<lb />
			subsidiary company will owe their duty to those companies and are
			<lb />
			not to be dictated by the parent company if it is not in the interest
			<lb />
			of the subsidiaries.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.33
			<lb />
			The decisions Re: Neath Rugby Limited 22 and Central
			<lb />
			Bank of Ecuador and others vs. Conticorp SA and others
			<lb />
			(Bahamas) 23 , are relied upon to show that while a nominee director
			<lb />
			is entitled to take care of the interests of the nominator, he is duty
			<lb />
			bound to act in the best interests of the company and not fetter his
			<lb />
			discretion.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.34
			<lb />
			The question as to (i) what is in the interest of the
			<lb />
			company, (ii) what is in the best interest of the members of the
			<lb />
			company as a whole and (iii) what is in the interest of a nominator,
			<lb />
			all lie in locations whose borders and dividing lines are always
			<lb />
			blurred. If philosophical rhetoric is kept aside for a moment, it will
			<lb />
			be clear that success and profit making are at the core of business
			<lb />
			enterprises. Therefore, the best interest of the majority shareholders
			<lb />
			need not necessarily be in conflict with the interest of the minority
			<lb />
			or best interest of the members of the company as a whole, unless
			<lb />
			there is siphoning of or diversion. Such a question does not arise
			<lb />
			when the majority shareholders happen to be charitable Trusts
			<lb />
			engaged in philanthropic activities. It is good to wish that the
			<lb />
			creation gets liberated from the creator, so long as the creator
			<lb />
			does not have any control or ability to manipulate. In the
			<lb />
			corporate world, democracy cannot be seen as an ugly expression,
			<lb />
			after using the very same democratic process for the appointment of
			<lb />
			directors.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.35
			<lb />
			Much ado was made about preconsultation and pre
			<lb />
			clearance by the Trustees, even before the Board took a call. But it
			<lb />
			was actually about nothing. Whenever an institution happens to be
			<lb />
			a shareholder and a notice of a meeting either of the Board or of the
			<lb />
			General body is issued, it is but normal for the institution to have
			<lb />
			an idea about the stand to be taken by them in the forthcoming
			<lb />
			meeting.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.36
			<lb />
			Objections were raised about RNT vetting the minutes of
			<lb />
			the meetings of the Board post facto and his participation as a
			<lb />
			shadow Director. But as we have pointed out elsewhere, CPM
			<lb />
			himself sought, while accepting the office of Executive
			<lb />
			Chairmanship, the continued guidance of RNT. When the Board, of
			<lb />
			which CPM was a Chairman, nominated RNT as Chairman
			<lb />
			Emeritus and recorded their desire to look forward to his support
			<lb />
			and guidance, it is not open to the complainant companies to call
			<lb />
			RNT a shadow Director. If someone, aggrieved after his removal
			<lb />
			from office can engage in shadowboxing through the companies
			<lb />
			controlled by him, he cannot accuse the very same person who
			<lb />
			chose him as successor to be a shadow director. Someone who
			<lb />
			gained entry through the very same door, cannot condemn it when
			<lb />
			asked to exit.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.37
			<lb />
			Therefore, the challenge to the affirmative voting rights
			<lb />
			and the allegations revolving around pre consultation and pre
			<lb />
			clearance by the Trusts of all items in the agenda and RNT&apos;s
			<lb />
			indirect or direct influence or grip over the Board are all liable to be
			<lb />
			rejected. That leaves us with one more related issue, under this
			<lb />
			question of law and the same relates to the claim of SP group for
			<lb />
			proportionate representation on the Board. We shall now go to the
			<lb />
			same.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<head>
			Claim for proportionate representation
			<lb />
		</head>
		<p>
			19.38
			<lb />
			As we have pointed out elsewhere, the Statute confers
			<lb />
			upon the members of a company limited by shares, a right to vote
			<lb />
			in a general meeting. And this right is proportionate to his
			<lb />
			shareholding as per Section 47(1)(b). Section 152 which contains
			<lb />
			provisions for the appointment of Directors, does not confer any
			<lb />
			right of proportionate representation on the Board of any company,
			<lb />
			be it public or private.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.39
			<lb />
			The maximum extent, to which the Parliament has gone
			<lb />
			under the 2013 Act, is to make a provision under Section 151,
			<lb />
			enabling &quot;a listed company&quot; to have one Director elected by such
			<lb />
			small shareholders in such manner and on such terms and
			<lb />
			conditions as may be prescribed. Though a similar prescription
			<lb />
			was incorporated in Section 252(1) of the Companies Act, 1956,
			<lb />
			under Act 53 of 2000, it was not exactly the same. For the purpose
			<lb />
			of easy appreciation, the proviso to Subsection (1) of Section 252 of
			<lb />
			the 1956 Act and Section 151 of the 2013 Act are presented in a

			<lb />
			The important features to be noticed in the 1956 Act and
			<lb />
			the 2013 Act are : (i) that Section 252 of the 1956 Act was
			<lb />
			applicable to every public company but not to a public company
			<lb />
			which has become such by virtue of Section 43A, indicating thereby
			<lb />
			that it would not have had any application to Tata Sons; (ii) that in
			<lb />
			contrast, Section 151 of the 2013 Act applies only to listed
			<lb />
			companies; (iii) that for the application of the proviso to Section
			<lb />
			252(1) of the 1956 Act, the public company should have a paidup
			<lb />
			capital of Rs.5 crores or more and 1000 or more small shareholders;
			<lb />
			(iv) that in contrast the applicability of Section 151 of the 2013 Act
			<lb />
			does not depend upon either the paidup capital or the number of
			<lb />
			small shareholders; and (v) that the definition of the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;small shareholders&quot; is just the same under both the enactments.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.41
			<lb />
			It is interesting to note that the smallness conceived by
			<lb />
			the 1956 Act is virtually minuscule. One would qualify to be a small
			<lb />
			shareholder only if he holds shares of a nominal value of
			<lb />
			Rs.20,000/ or less, in a public company having a paidup capital
			<lb />
			of Rs.5 crores or more. This proportion works out to 1/2500 or
			<lb />
			0.04%.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.42
			<lb />
			One must be careful to note that both under Section
			<lb />
			252(1) of the 1956 Act and under Section 151 of the 2013 Act, the
			<lb />
			spotlight was only on &quot;small shareholders&quot; and not on &quot;minority
			<lb />
			shareholders&quot; like the S.P. Group which holds around 18.37%. In
			<lb />
			fact, admittedly the value of this 18.37% of shareholding of the S.P.
			<lb />
			Group, as of March2016 was around Rs.58,441 crores. It is
			<lb />
			claimed that the purchase consideration of these shares at the
			<lb />
			relevant point of time was Rs.69 crores and that during the period
			<lb />
			from 1991 to 2016, SP group had received aggregate dividends to
			<lb />
			the tune of Rs.872 crores. We do not know whether this kind of a
			<lb />
			huge return on investment and the skyrocketing of the appreciation
			<lb />
			of the value of investment, is also due to oppressive conduct or
			<lb />
			despite oppressive conduct.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.43
			<lb />
			Whatever it be, the right to claim proportionate
			<lb />
			representation is not available even to a minority shareholder
			<lb />
			statutorily, both under the 1956 Act and under the 2013 Act. It is
			<lb />
			available only to a small shareholder, which S.P. Group is certainly
			<lb />
			not.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.44
			<lb />
			The right to claim proportionate representation is not
			<lb />
			available for the S.P. group even contractually, in terms of the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association. Neither S.P. Group nor CPM can request the
			<lb />
			Tribunal to rewrite the contract, by seeking an amendment of the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association. The Articles of Association, as they exist
			<lb />
			today, are binding upon S.P. Group and CPM by virtue of Section
			<lb />
			10(1) of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.45
			<lb />
			Realising the fact that they have no right, statutorily or
			<lb />
			contractually or otherwise to demand proportionate representation
			<lb />
			on the Board, S.P. Group has come up with a very novel idea,
			<lb />
			namely the claim of existence of a quasipartnership between the
			<lb />
			Tata group and SP group. It is contended by S.P. Group that there
			<lb />
			existed a personal relationship between those in management of the
			<lb />
			S.P. Group and those in management of Tata Sons for over several
			<lb />
			decades and that the relationship was one of trust and mutual
			<lb />
			confidence. According to S.P. Group, they acted as the guardian of
			<lb />
			the Tata Group when the Tata Trust had no voting rights.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it is claimed that there is a right and a legitimate
			<lb />
			expectation to have a representation on the Board of Tata Sons.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.46
			<lb />
			But we do not think that there ever existed a relationship
			<lb />
			in the nature of quasi partnership. As we have pointed out
			<lb />
			elsewhere, the company was incorporated in the year 1917 and S.P.
			<lb />
			Group became a shareholder in 1965, namely after 50 years. A
			<lb />
			berth on the Board of Tata Sons was granted only in the year 1980
			<lb />
			to CPM&apos;s father. Therefore, there is nothing on record in the form of
			<lb />
			pleadings or proof, to show that there was either (i) a preexisting
			<lb />
			relationship before the incorporation of the company or (ii) a living
			<lb />
			in relationship picked up half way through, by entering into an
			<lb />
			agreement in the nature of a partnership.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.47
			<lb />
			In fact, CPM&apos;s father was inducted into the Board in
			<lb />
			1980, after 15 years of acquisition of shares and such induction
			<lb />
			was not in recognition of any statutory or contractual right. After
			<lb />
			his father&apos;s exit in 2004, CPM was inducted in 2006, neither in
			<lb />
			recognition of a contractual right nor in recognition of a hereditary
			<lb />
			or statutory right.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.48
			<lb />
			The claim for proportionate representation can also be
			<lb />
			looked at from another angle. RNT who was holding the mantle as
			<lb />
			the Chairman of Tata Sons for a period of 21 years from 1991 to
			<lb />
			2012, actually conceded a more than proportionate share to the
			<lb />
			S.P. Group by nominating CPM as his successor. Accordingly CPM
			<lb />
			was also crowned as Executive Deputy Chairman on 16.3.2012 and
			<lb />
			as Chairman later. CPM continued as Executive Chairman till he
			<lb />
			set his own house on fire in 2016. If the company&apos;s affairs have
			<lb />
			been or are being conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial
			<lb />
			to the interests of the S.P. group, we wonder how a representative of
			<lb />
			the S.P. Group holding a little over 18% of the share capital could
			<lb />
			have moved upto the top most position within a period of six years
			<lb />
			of his induction. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the
			<lb />
			claim for proportionate representation on the Board is neither
			<lb />
			statutorily or contractually sustainable nor factually justified.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.49
			<lb />
			Placing reliance upon section 163 of the Companies Act,
			<lb />
			2013, it was contended that proportionate representation is
			<lb />
			statutorily recognised. But this argument is completely
			<lb />
			misconceived. Section 163 of the 2013 Act corresponds to section
			<lb />
			265 of the 1956 Act. It enables a company to provide in their
			<lb />
			Articles of Association, for the appointment of not less than two
			<lb />
			thirds of the total number of Directors in accordance with the
			<lb />
			principle of proportionate representation by means of a single
			<lb />
			transferable vote. First of all, proportionate representation by
			<lb />
			means of a single transferable vote, is not the same as
			<lb />
			representation on the Board for a group of minority shareholders, in
			<lb />
			proportion to the percentage of shareholding they have. It is a
			<lb />
			system where the voters exercise their franchise by ranking several
			<lb />
			candidates of their choice, with first preference, second preference
			<lb />
			etc. Moreover, it is only an enabling provision and it is upto the
			<lb />
			company to make a provision for the same in their Articles, if they
			<lb />
			so choose. There is no statutory compulsion to incorporate such a
			<lb />
			provision.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.50
			<lb />
			Therefore, the fourth question of law is also to be
			<lb />
			answered in favour of the Tata group and the claim in the cross
			<lb />
			appeal relating to affirmative voting rights and proportionate
			<lb />
			representation are liable to be rejected.
			<lb />

			20. Question No.5
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			20.1
			<lb />
			The 5 th question of law formulated for consideration is as
			<lb />
			to whether the reconversion of Tata Sons from a public company
			<lb />
			into a private company, required the necessary approval under
			<lb />
			section 14 of the Companies Act, 2013 or at least an action under
			<lb />
			section 43A(4) of the Companies Act, 1956 during the period from
			<lb />
			2000 (when Act 53 of 2000 came into force) to 2013 (when the 2013
			<lb />
			Act was enacted) as held by NCLAT ?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.2
			<lb />
			As we have pointed out elsewhere, Tata Sons was
			<lb />
			actually incorporated as a Private Limited Company, but was
			<lb />
			deemed to have become a Public Limited Company, with effect from
			<lb />
			01.02.1975, by virtue of Section 43A (1A) of the Companies Act,
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1956. However, by virtue of the proviso to Subsection (1A), the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association of the Company, continued to retain the
			<lb />
			provisions relating to the matters specified in subclauses (a), (b)
			<lb />
			and (c) of Clause (iii) of Subsection (1) of Section 3 of the 1956 Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.3
			<lb />
			By Act 53 of 2000, the deeming fiction in section 43A was
			<lb />
			removed and the whole concept of private companies becoming
			<lb />
			public companies disappeared from the date of coming into force of
			<lb />
			this Act 53 of 2000.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.4
			<lb />
			The Companies Act, 2013 did not include any provision
			<lb />
			similar to section 43A. Therefore, Tata Sons passed a resolution in
			<lb />
			its 99 th Annual General meeting held on 21092017 to alter the
			<lb />
			Memorandum and Articles so as to insert the word &quot;private&quot; in
			<lb />
			between the words &quot;Sons&quot; and &quot;Limited&quot; in its name.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.5
			<lb />
			On 09.07.2018, the complaint under sections 241 and
			<lb />
			242 was dismissed by NCLT and hence Tata Sons approached the
			<lb />
			Registrar of Companies on 19.07.2018 seeking an amendment to
			<lb />
			the Certificate of Incorporation. It appears that S.P. Group filed
			<lb />
			objections with the Registrar of Companies on the ground that they
			<lb />
			were filing appeals against the order of the NCLT. But the Registrar
			<lb />
			of Companies issued an amended certificate on 06.08.2018.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.6
			<lb />
			Upon coming to know of the issue of amended Certificate
			<lb />
			of Incorporation, S.P. Group filed an additional affidavit before
			<lb />
			NCLAT on 10.08.2018 in the appeals that came up for hearing.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.7
			<lb />
			While allowing the appeals of S.P. Group by a judgment
			<lb />
			dated 18.12.2019, NCLAT declared the action of the Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies in issuing the amended Certificate of Incorporation
			<lb />
			as illegal with a further direction to the Registrar of Companies to
			<lb />
			make necessary corrections in the records showing the Company as
			<lb />
			a Public Company.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.8
			<lb />
			The Registrar of Companies moved an application under
			<lb />
			Sections 420(2) and 424(1) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with
			<lb />
			Rule 11 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016, seeking removal of the
			<lb />
			observations made in Paragraphs 181, 186 and 187(iv) of the
			<lb />
			judgment. This application was dismissed by the NCLAT by an
			<lb />
			order dated 06.01.2020, not only holding that no aspersions were
			<lb />
			cast in the judgment of the NCLAT on the Registrar of Companies
			<lb />
			warranting any review/clarification, but also providing certain
			<lb />
			additional reasons. It is under these circumstances that the 5 th
			<lb />
			question of law revolving around Section 43A of the 1956 Act as
			<lb />
			amended by Act 53 of 2000, and the Companies Act, 2013 has
			<lb />
			arisen for consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.9
			<lb />
			A look at Section 43A would show that it was actually
			<lb />
			inserted under Companies (Amendment) Act 65 of 1960 with effect
			<lb />
			from 28.12.1960. This Section underwent two amendments, one
			<lb />
			under Act 41 of 1974 with effect from 01.02.1975 and another
			<lb />
			under Act 31 of 1988 with effect from 15.06.1988. Finally, by Act
			<lb />
			53 of 2000, Section 43A was made inapplicable with effect from
			<lb />
			13.12.2000.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.10
			<lb />
			Section 43A, as inserted by Act 65 of 1960, together with
			<lb />
			the amendments made under Act 41 of 1974, Act 31 of 1988 and
			<lb />
			Act 53 of 2000, is reproduced as follows:

			<lb />

		</item>

		<item>
			(11) Nothing contained in this section, except sub

			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20.11
			<lb />
			In its inception, Section 43A contained only one
			<lb />
			stipulation namely that a private company in which not less than
			<lb />
			25% of the paid up share capital was held by one or more bodies
			<lb />
			corporate, shall become a public company. But by Act 41 of 1974,
			<lb />
			two additional stipulations were included. They are (i) that a private
			<lb />
			company whose average turnover during the relevant period is not
			<lb />
			less than an amount prescribed, shall become a public company,
			<lb />
			irrespective of its paid up share capital; and (ii) that a private
			<lb />
			company which holds not less than 25% of the paid up share
			<lb />
			capital of a public company, shall become a public company.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.12
			<lb />
			By Act 31 of 1988, the benchmark of the average annual
			<lb />
			turnover that would determine the applicability of Section 43A was
			<lb />
			prescribed as not less than Rs. 1 crore. In addition, Act 31 of 1988
			<lb />
			also made a private company which accepts deposits from the
			<lb />
			public, other than its members or directors, to be a public
			<lb />
			company.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.13
			<lb />
			Two important prescriptions, which continued without
			<lb />
			any change, from the date of insertion of Section 43A, namely
			<lb />
			28.12.1960, till the coming into force of Act 53 of 2000 namely
			<lb />
			13.12.2000, were Subsections (2) and (4) of Section 43A. Sub
			<lb />
			section (2) imposed an obligation upon a private company which
			<lb />
			became a public company by virtue of section 43A, to inform the
			<lb />
			Registrar. Upon receipt of such information, the Registrar was
			<lb />
			ordained to delete the word &quot;private&quot; in the name of the company
			<lb />
			upon the register and also to make necessary alterations in the
			<lb />
			Certificate of Incorporation and its Memorandum of Association.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.14
			<lb />
			Subsection (4) declared that the status of such a
			<lb />
			company as a public company would continue until such time it
			<lb />
			becomes a private company (i) with the approval of the Central
			<lb />
			Government; and (ii) in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.15
			<lb />
			In Needle Industries (India) Ltd vs Needle Industries
			<lb />
			Newey (India) Ltd 24 , this court pointed out (A) that there are 3
			<lb />
			distinct types of companies, namely Private companies, Public
			<lb />
			Companies and deemed to be public companies which occupy a
			<lb />
			distinct place in the scheme of the Act (B) that private companies,
			<lb />
			which become public companies, but which continue to retain in
			<lb />
			their articles those matters mentioned in section 3(1)(iii) of the Act
			<lb />
			are also broadly and generally subjected to the rigorous discipline of
			<lb />
			the Act and (C) that though section 43A companies cannot claim
			<lb />
			the same privileges to which private companies are entitled, there
			<lb />
			are certain provisions of the Act which would apply to public
			<lb />
			companies, but not to Section 43A companies. An important
			<lb />
			observation found in Needle Industries, is that &quot;the policy of the Act
			<lb />
			if anything, points in the direction that the integrity and structure of
			<lb />
			section 43A proviso companies should, as far as possible, not be
			<lb />
			broken up&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.16
			<lb />
			Keeping the above stipulations in mind, let us now come
			<lb />
			to the amendments made to Section 43A under Act 53 of 2000, with
			<lb />
			effect from 13.12.2000. By this Act, two subsections namely Sub
			<lb />
			section (2A) and Subsection (11) were inserted in Section 43A.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.17
			<lb />
			By virtue of subsection (11), all the provisions of Section
			<lb />
			43A except subsection (2A) were made inapplicable on and after
			<lb />
			the commencement of Act 53 of 2000. This meant that with effect
			<lb />
			from 13.12.2000, the whole of Section 43A except Subsection (2A)
			<lb />
			got washed out.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.18
			<lb />
			Subsection (2A) prescribes the procedure to be followed
			<lb />
			by a company, which has earlier become a public company by
			<lb />
			virtue of Section 43A, but which has later become a private
			<lb />
			company after the commencement of Act 53 of 2000, to have
			<lb />
			necessary changes effected. The procedure prescribed by sub
			<lb />
			section (2A) for such reconversion (or Ghar Wapsi) is as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The company shall inform the Registrar that the company has
			<lb />
			again become a private company; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The Registrar shall thereupon substitute the word &quot;Private
			<lb />
			Company&quot; for the word &quot;Public Company&quot; upon the register
			<lb />
			and also make necessary alterations in the Certificate of
			<lb />
			Incorporation and its Memorandum of Association.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20.19
			<lb />
			But Act 53 of 2000 did not stop with section 43A. It also
			<lb />
			amended section 3(1)(iii) by inserting an additional subclause,
			<lb />
			namely &quot;(d)&quot; along with subclauses (a), (b) and (c). Under this sub
			<lb />
			clause (d) of clause (iii) of subsection (1) of section 3, the articles of
			<lb />
			association of a private company should also contain a prohibition
			<lb />
			on any invitation or acceptance of deposits from persons other than
			<lb />
			its members, directors or their relatives. Section 3(1)(iii) after
			<lb />
			amendment under Act 53 of 2000 read as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;3 (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the
			<lb />
			expressions &quot;company&quot;, &quot;existing company&quot;, &quot;private company&quot;
			<lb />
			and &quot;public company&quot;, shall, subject to the provisions of sub
			<lb />
			section (2), have the meanings specified below:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) &quot;private company&quot; means a company which has a
			<lb />
			minimum paidup capital of one lakh rupees or such higher paid
			<lb />
			up capital as may be prescribed, and by is articles,
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) restricts the right to transfer its shares, if any ;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) limits the number of its members to fifty not including
			<lb />
			(i) persons who are in the employment of the company ; and (ii)
			<lb />
			persons who, having been formerly in the employment of the
			<lb />
			company, were members of the company while in that
			<lb />
			employment and have continued to be members after the
			<lb />
			employment ceased ; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any
			<lb />
			shares in, or debentures of, the company ;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d) prohibits any invitation or acceptance of deposits
			<lb />
			from persons other than its members, directors or their
			<lb />
			relatives:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Provided that where two or more persons hold one or more
			<lb />
			shares in a company jointly, they shall, for the purposes of this
			<lb />
			definition, be treated as a single member;&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20.20
			<lb />
			Subclause (d) was what was added to section 3(1)(iii) by
			<lb />
			Act 53 of 2000, even while scrapping the concept of a deemed
			<lb />
			public company. But this subclause (d) is nothing but subsection
			<lb />
			(1C) of section 43A. Though section 43A was being scrapped in
			<lb />
			effect, the Parliament wanted to retain the prescription contained in
			<lb />
			subsection (1C) of section 43A and which is why subclause (d)
			<lb />
			was inserted under section 3(1) (iii).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.21
			<lb />
			But while doing so under Act 53 of 2000, a major
			<lb />
			omission happened. The omission related to section 27 (3) of the
			<lb />
			1956 Act. Section 27 of the 1956 Act contained stipulations as to
			<lb />
			what the Articles of Association of (i) an unlimited company (ii) a
			<lb />
			company limited by guarantee and (iii) a private company limited by
			<lb />
			shares, should contain. It reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;27. REGULATIONS REQUIRED IN CASE OF UNLIMITED
			<lb />
			COMPANY, COMPANY LIMITED BY GUARANTEE OR PRIVATE
			<lb />
			COMPANY LIMITED BY SHARES
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(1) In the case of an unlimited company, the articles shall
			<lb />
			state the number of members with which the company is to be
			<lb />
			registered and, if the company has a share capital, the amount
			<lb />
			of share capital with which the company is to be registered.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) In the case of a company limited by guarantee, the
			<lb />
			articles shall state the number of members with which the
			<lb />
			company is to be registered.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) In the case of a private company having a share
			<lb />
			capital, the articles shall contain provisions relating to the
			<lb />
			matters specified in subclauses (a), (b) and (c) of clause (iii) of
			<lb />
			subsection (1) of section 3; and in the case of any other private
			<lb />
			company, the articles shall contain provisions relating to the
			<lb />
			matters specified in the said subclauses (b) and (c).&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20.22
			<lb />
			No corresponding amendment was made to Section 27
			<lb />
			(3), by Act 53 of 2000, so as to make it in tune with the amended
			<lb />
			section 3(1)(iii). The result was that on and from 13122000 (the
			<lb />
			date of coming into force of Act 53 of 2000), section 3(1)(iii)
			<lb />
			contained 4 requirements for a private company, but section 27(3)
			<lb />
			referred only to 3 requirements. The incongruity can be stated thus.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			To fall within the definition of a private company, 4 stipulations
			<lb />
			contained in section 3(1)(iii) were to be satisfied. But under section
			<lb />
			27(3), it is enough if the Articles of Association of a private company
			<lb />
			contained only 3 prescriptions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.23
			<lb />
			Be that as it may, the consequence of the amendment to
			<lb />
			section 3(1)(iii), under Act 53 of 2000, was that a company which
			<lb />
			wanted to take the route of subsection (2A) of section 43A, after the
			<lb />
			coming into force of Act 53 of 2000 and reconvert itself into a
			<lb />
			private company, was required to satisfy the rigours of subclauses
			<lb />
			(a), (b) and (c) as well as (d) of clause (iii) of subsection(1) of section
			<lb />
			3. In other words, the Articles of Association of such a company
			<lb />
			should contain all the 4 prescriptions namely (i) restriction on the
			<lb />
			right to transfer shares (ii) limitation on the number of members (iii)
			<lb />
			prohibition of any invitation to the public to subscribe for
			<lb />
			shares/debentures and (iv) prohibition of any invitation or
			<lb />
			acceptance of deposits from persons other than members/Directors
			<lb />
			or their relatives.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.24
			<lb />
			The Articles of Association of Tata Sons had the
			<lb />
			prescriptions contained in subclauses (a), (b) and (c), but not sub
			<lb />
			clause (d). Therefore, they did not take any steps in terms of sub
			<lb />
			section (2A) of section 43A after the advent of Act 53 of 2000.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.25
			<lb />
			But Companies Act, 2013 changed the complexion of the
			<lb />
			game. It not merely put an end to the concept of deemed public
			<lb />
			companies, but also restored the definition of the expression
			<lb />
			&apos;private company&quot; to the position that prevailed before Act 53 of
			<lb />
			2000. Section 2(68) of the 2013 Act which defines a &quot;private
			<lb />
			company&quot; incorporated only the original 3 prescriptions contained
			<lb />
			in subclauses (a), (b) and (c) of clause (iii) of subsection (1) of
			<lb />
			section 3. The stipulation inserted as subclause (d) by Act 53 of
			<lb />
			2000, is omitted in section 2(68). Section 2(68) of the 2013 Act
			<lb />
			reads as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			Sec 2 (68) &quot;private company&quot; means a company having
			<lb />
			a minimum paidup share capital of one lakh rupees or
			<lb />
			such higher paidup share capital as may be
			<lb />
			prescribed,
			<lb />
			and which by its articles,
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			restricts the right to transfer its shares;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) except in case of One Person Company, limits
			<lb />
			the number of its members to two hundred:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Provided that where two or more
			<lb />
			persons hold one or more shares in a
			<lb />
			company jointly, they shall, for the
			<lb />
			purposes of this clause, be treated as a
			<lb />
			single
			<lb />
			member:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Provided further that-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(A) persons who are in the employment of
			<lb />
			the company; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(B) persons who, having been formerly in
			<lb />
			the employment of the company, were
			<lb />
			members of the company while in that
			<lb />
			employment and have continued to be
			<lb />
			members after the employment ceased,
			<lb />
			shall not be included in the number of members;
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) prohibits any invitation to the public to
			<lb />
			subscribe
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			any
			<lb />
			securities
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			the company;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20.26
			<lb />
			But Companies Act, 2013, created one confusion.
			<lb />
			Different provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, came into force on
			<lb />
			different dates (driving people crazy). Section 2(68) which defines a
			<lb />
			private company, came into force on 12092013 vide S.O. 2754 (E)
			<lb />
			dated 12092013. This notification issued under section 1(3) of the
			<lb />
			2013 Act, fixed 12092013 as the appointed date for the coming
			<lb />
			into force of section 2(68).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.27
			<lb />
			But on 12092013, the date appointed for the coming
			<lb />
			into force of section 2(68) of the Companies Act, 2013, the old Act,
			<lb />
			namely the Companies Act, 1956 had not been repealed. The
			<lb />
			provisions for repeal are contained in Section 465 of The Companies
			<lb />
			Act, 2013. Section 465(1) repeals the 1956 Act, subject to certain
			<lb />
			stipulations mentioned in the provisos there under. Subsection (2)
			<lb />
			of Section 465 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides a list of matters
			<lb />
			which will stand saved despite the repeal of the 1956 Act. Sub
			<lb />
			section (3) of Section 465 makes it clear that the mention of
			<lb />
			particular matters in Subsection (2) shall not be held to prejudice
			<lb />
			the general application of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act,
			<lb />
			1897.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			20.28
			<lb />
			The provisions of Section 465, in so far as they relate to
			<lb />
			the repeal of the 1956 Act are concerned, came into force on 3001
			<lb />
			2019, vide S.O. 560 (E) dated 30012019. In other words, the
			<lb />
			provisions of the 1956 Act continued to be in force till repealed on
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			30012019. It means that the criteria for a &quot;private company&quot;
			<lb />
			under subclauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of clause (iii) of subsection (1)
			<lb />
			of section 3 of the 1956 Act, did not stand repealed until 3001
			<lb />
			2019. But the new definition of a &quot;private company&quot; under section
			<lb />
			2(68) of the 2013 Act had already come into effect on and from 12
			<lb />
			092013.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			20.29
			<lb />
			As a result, we had 2 definitions of the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;private company&quot; from 12092013 [the date appointed for the
			<lb />
			coming into force of section 2(68) of the 2013 Act] to 30012019
			<lb />
			(the date on which section 3(1) of the 1956 Act became a dead letter
			<lb />
			consequent upon the repeal of the 1956 Act through the notification
			<lb />
			of the repeal provision under section 465).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			20.30
			<lb />
			Therefore, we have to fall back upon section 465(3) of the
			<lb />
			2013 Act to conclude that section 2(68) of the 2013 Act will prevail
			<lb />
			over section 3(1)(iii) of the 1956 Act. In other words, on and from
			<lb />
			12092013, the question whether a company is a private company
			<lb />
			or not, will be determined only by the definition of the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;private company&quot; found in section 2(68) of the 2013 Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			20.31
			<lb />
			The articles of association of Tata sons contain the
			<lb />
			restrictions prescribed in subclauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 3(1)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) of the 1956 Act, but they do not satisfy the requirement of sub
			<lb />
			clause (d) incorporated in the year 2000. However, on and from 12
			<lb />
			092013, which is the date appointed for the coming into force of
			<lb />
			section 2(68) of the 2013 Act, the articles of association of Tata
			<lb />
			Sons satisfy the requirements of Section 2(68) of the 2013 Act.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it was and it continues to be a private company.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			20.32
			<lb />
			In other words, the status of Tata Sons
			<lb />
		</item>

			(i) was that of a private company till 31011975;

			<lb />
			from 01021975 till 12122000;

		<item>
			(iii) was that of a company that continued to be a deemed to be

			<lb />
			section 3(1)(iii) of the 1956 Act as amended by Act 53 of 2000 with

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) was that of a private company with effect from 12092013
			<lb />
			within the meaning of section 2(68) of the 2013 Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20.33
			<lb />
			Interestingly, it is not disputed by anyone that today Tata
			<lb />
			Sons satisfy the parameters of section 2(68) of
			<lb />
			the 2013 Act. The
			<lb />
			dispute raised by the S.P. Group and accepted by NCLAT is only
			<lb />
			with regard to the procedure followed for reconversion. NCLAT was
			<lb />
			of the opinion that Tata Sons ought to have followed the procedure
			<lb />
			prescribed in Section 14(1)(b) read with Subsections (2) and (3) of
			<lb />
			Section 14 of the Companies Act, 2013 for getting an amended
			<lb />
			certificate of incorporation. NCLAT was surprised (quite
			<lb />
			surprisingly) that Tata Sons remained silent for more than 13 years
			<lb />
			from 2000 to 2013 without taking steps for reconversion in terms of
			<lb />
			Section 43A(4) of the 1956 Act. While on the one hand, NCLAT took
			<lb />
			note of the &quot;lethargy&quot; on the part of Tata Sons in taking action for
			<lb />
			reconversion, NCLAT, on the other hand also took adverse notice of
			<lb />
			the speed with which they swung into action after the dismissal of
			<lb />
			the complaint by NCLT.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			20.34
			<lb />
			But what NCLAT failed to see was that Tata sons did not
			<lb />
			become a public company by choice, but became one by operation
			<lb />
			of law. Therefore, we do not know how such a company should also
			<lb />
			be asked to follow the rigors of Section 14(1)(b) of the 2013 Act. As
			<lb />
			a matter of fact, Section 14(1) does not ipso facto deal with the issue
			<lb />
			of conversion of private company into a public company or vice
			<lb />
			versa. Primarily, Section 14(1) deals with the issue of alteration of
			<lb />
			Articles of Association of the company. Incidentally, Section 14(1)
			<lb />
			also deals with the alteration of Articles &quot;having the effect of such
			<lb />
			conversion&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.35
			<lb />
			By virtue of the proviso to subsection(1A) of Section 43A
			<lb />
			of the 1956 Act, Tata Sons continued to have articles that covered
			<lb />
			the matters specified in subclauses (a), (b) and (c) of Clause(iii) of
			<lb />
			Subsection(1) of Section 3 of the 1956 Act. Though it did not have
			<lb />
			the additional stipulation introduced by Act 53 of 2000, namely the
			<lb />
			stipulation relating to acceptance of deposits from public, this
			<lb />
			additional requirement disappeared in the 2013 Act. Therefore, Tata
			<lb />
			Sons wanted a mere amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation,
			<lb />
			which is not something that is covered by Section 14 of the 2013
			<lb />
			Act. NCLAT mixed up the attempt of Tata Sons to have the
			<lb />
			Certificate of Incorporation amended, with an attempt to have the
			<lb />
			Articles of Association amended. Since Tata Sons satisfied the
			<lb />
			criteria prescribed in Section 2(68) of the 2013 Act, they applied to
			<lb />
			the Registrar of companies for amendment of the certificate. The
			<lb />
			certificate is a mere recognition of the status of the company and it
			<lb />
			does not by itself create one.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.36
			<lb />
			As pointed out by this court in Ram Parshotam Mittal
			<lb />
			Vs. Hillcrest Realty 25 , &quot;it is not the records of the Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies which determines the status of the company&quot;. The status
			<lb />
			of the company is determined by the Articles of association and the
			<lb />
			statutory provisions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.37
			<lb />
			NCLAT was wrong in thinking that Tata Sons ought to
			<lb />
			have taken action during the period 20002013 and obtained
			<lb />
			approval of the Central Government to become a private company
			<lb />
			under Subsection (4) of Section 43A of the 1956 Act. Subsection
			<lb />
			(11) of section 43A, inserted under Act 53 of 2000 made all sub
			<lb />
			sections of Section 43A except subsection (2A), inapplicable on and
			<lb />
			after the commencement of the Act. Therefore, it is clear that Sub
			<lb />
			section (4) ceased to exist on and from 13.12.2000 and hence the
			<lb />
			question of Tata Sons seeking the approval of the Central
			<lb />
			Government under Subsection (4) during the period 20002013 did
			<lb />
			not arise.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.38
			<lb />
			The only provision that survived after 13.12.2000 was
			<lb />
			Subsection (2A) of Section 43A. It survived till 30012019 until the
			<lb />
			whole of the 1956 Act was repealed. There are two aspects to Sub
			<lb />
			section (2A). The first is that the very concept of &quot;deemed to be
			<lb />
			public company&quot; was washed out under Act 53 of 2000. The second
			<lb />
			aspect is the prescription of certain formalities to remove the
			<lb />
			remnants of the past. What was omitted to be done by Tata Sons
			<lb />
			from 2000 to 2013 was only the second aspect of Subsection (2A),
			<lb />
			for which Section 465 of the 2013 Act did not stand as an
			<lb />
			impediment. Section 43A(2A) continued to be in force till 3001
			<lb />
			2019 and hence the procedure adopted by Tata Sons and the RoC
			<lb />
			in July/August 2018 when section 43A(2A) was still available, was
			<lb />
			perfectly in order.
			<lb />
			20.39
			<lb />
			As rightly held by this court in Darius Rutton
			<lb />
			Kavasmaneck vs. Gharda Chemicals Ltd 26 , Parliament always
			<lb />
			recognised the possibility of a deemed public company again
			<lb />
			reverting back to the status of a private company. Though this court
			<lb />
			took note of the conflict between section 27(3) and section 3(1)(iii)
			<lb />
			(d), after the amendment by Act 53 of 2000, this court nevertheless
			<lb />
			held in Gharda Chemicals that by incorporating the requirement of
			<lb />
			subclause (d) of section 3(1)(iii) in the Articles of Association, a
			<lb />
			deemed public company can revert back to its status as a private
			<lb />
			company, in view of subsection (2A) of section 43A, by
			<lb />
			incorporating necessary provisions in the Articles. In simple terms,
			<lb />
			a company which becomes a deemed public company by operation
			<lb />
			of law, cannot be taken to have undergone a process of
			<lb />
			fermentation or coagulation like milk to become curd or yogurt,
			<lb />
			having an irreversible effect.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.40
			<lb />
			Therefore, NCLAT was completely wrong in holding as
			<lb />
			though Tata Sons, in connivance with the Registrar of companies
			<lb />
			did something clandestinely, contrary to the procedure established
			<lb />
			by law. The request made by Tata Sons and the action taken by the
			<lb />
			Registrar of Companies to amend the Certificate of Incorporation
			<lb />
			were perfectly in order.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.41
			<lb />
			It was argued on behalf of SP group (i) that in 1995 Tata
			<lb />
			Sons allowed renunciation of entitlement to rights issue, in favour
			<lb />
			of rank outsiders, throwing the restriction contained in section 3(1)
			<lb />
			(iii) to the wind (ii) that till September 2002, Tata Sons accepted
			<lb />
			deposits from public and hence subclause (d) of section 3(1)(iii) was
			<lb />
			not satisfied (iii) that as per the circular of the Department of
			<lb />
			Company Affairs, a company which does not approach the RoC for
			<lb />
			reconversion would be deemed to have chosen to remain as a public
			<lb />
			company (iv) that as per RBI circular dated 112002 private
			<lb />
			companies accepting deposits would become public companies (v)
			<lb />
			that till the year 2009, Tata Sons chose to describe itself only as a
			<lb />
			public company in the forms filed under Rule 10 of the Companies
			<lb />
			(Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 1975 (vi) that the conversion
			<lb />
			adversely affected the ability of Tata Sons to raise funds increasing
			<lb />
			borrowing costs (vii) that Tata Sons will be required to refund the
			<lb />
			investments made by insurance companies on account of the
			<lb />
			conversion and (viii) that the act of conversion lacked probity and
			<lb />
			was also prejudicial to the interests of the minority shareholders
			<lb />
			and the company as well as independent directors.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.42
			<lb />
			But we are not impressed with the above contentions.
			<lb />
			Once the company had become a deemed public company with
			<lb />
			effect from 121975, the privileges of a private company stood
			<lb />
			withdrawn and the company was entitled in law to allow
			<lb />
			renunciation of shares under rights issue. In any case, the validity
			<lb />
			of what was done in 1995 was not in question. That they accepted
			<lb />
			deposits from public till September 2002, is the reason why they
			<lb />
			were not reconverted as a private company at that time. Once a new
			<lb />
			definition of the expression &quot;private company&quot; came into force with
			<lb />
			effect from 12092013 under section 2(68) of the 2013 Act, the only
			<lb />
			test to be applied is to find out if the company fits into the scheme
			<lb />
			under the new Act or not. We need not go to the circulars issued by
			<lb />
			the department or the RBI when statutory provisions show the path
			<lb />
			with clarity. The description of the company in the forms filed under
			<lb />
			Rule 10, reflected the true position that prevailed then and they
			<lb />
			would not act as estoppel when the company was entitled to take
			<lb />
			advantage of the law. That the ability of the company to raise funds
			<lb />
			has now gone and that the company will have to repay the
			<lb />
			investments made by insurance companies, are all matters which
			<lb />
			the shareholders and the Directors are to take care. The question
			<lb />
			before the court is whether the reconversion is in accordance with
			<lb />
			law or not. The question is not whether it is good for the company
			<lb />
			or not.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.43
			<lb />
			The real reason why SP group and CPM are aggrieved by
			<lb />
			the conversion is, that most of their arguments are traceable to
			<lb />
			provisions which apply only to public and listed public companies.
			<lb />
			If reconversion goes, they may perhaps stand on a better footing.
			<lb />
			But that would tantamount to putting the cart before the horse.
			<lb />
			One may be entitled to a collateral benefit arising out of a
			<lb />
			substantial argument. But one cannot seek to succeed on a
			<lb />
			collateral issue so as to make the substantial argument
			<lb />
			sustainable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			20.44
			<lb />
			Therefore, question of law No. 5 is accordingly answered
			<lb />
			in favour of Tata Sons and as a consequence, all the observations
			<lb />
			made against the appellants and the Registrar of companies in
			<lb />
			Paragraphs 181, 186 and 187 (iv) of the impugned judgment are set
			<lb />
			aside.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<head>
			21. Conclusion
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			21.1
			<lb />
			Thus in fine, all the questions of law are liable to be
			<lb />
			answered in favour of the appellantsTata group and the appeals
			<lb />
			filed by the Tata Group are liable to be allowed and the appeal filed
			<lb />
			by S.P. Group is liable to be dismissed. But before we do that we
			<lb />
			should also deal with the application moved by S.P. Group before
			<lb />
			us during the pendency of these proceedings, praying for the
			<lb />
			alternative relief of directing Tata Sons and others to cause a
			<lb />
			separation of ownership interests of the S.P. Group in Tata sons
			<lb />
			through a scheme of reduction of capital by extinguishing the
			<lb />
			shares held by the S.P. Group in lieu of fair compensation effected
			<lb />
			through a transfer of proportionate shares of the underlying listed
			<lb />
			companies, with the balance value of unlisted companies and
			<lb />
			intangibles including brand value being settled in cash.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.2
			<lb />
			Interestingly, such an application was filed after Tata
			<lb />
			Group moved an application for restraining S.P. Group from raising
			<lb />
			money by pledging shares and this court passed an order of status
			<lb />
			quo on 22.09.2020. For the first time S.P. Group seems to have
			<lb />
			realized the futility of the litigation and the nature of the order that
			<lb />
			the Tribunal can pass under Section 242. This is reflected in
			<lb />
			Paragraph 62 of the application, where S.P. Group has stated that
			<lb />
			they are seeking such an alternative remedy as a means to put an
			<lb />
			end to the matters complained of.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.3
			<lb />
			As a matter of fact, S.P. Group should have sought such
			<lb />
			a relief from the Tribunal even at the beginning. As we have pointed
			<lb />
			out elsewhere a divorce without acrimony is what is encouraged
			<lb />
			both in England and in India under the statutory regime.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.4
			<lb />
			But in an appeal under Section 423 of the Companies
			<lb />
			Act, 2013, this Court is concerned with questions of law arising out
			<lb />
			of the order of NCLAT. Therefore, we will not decide this prayer. It
			<lb />
			should be pointed out at this stage that Article 75 of the Articles of
			<lb />
			Association is nothing but a provision for an exit option (though one
			<lb />
			may think of it as an expulsion option). After attacking Article 75
			<lb />
			before NCLT, the S.P. Group cannot ask this Court to go into the
			<lb />
			question of fixation of fair value compensation for exercising an exit
			<lb />
			option. What is pleaded in Paragraph 72 of the application for
			<lb />
			separation of ownership interests, require an adjudication on facts,
			<lb />
			of various items. The valuation of the shares of S.P. Group depends
			<lb />
			upon the value of the stake of Tata Sons in listed equities, unlisted
			<lb />
			equities, immovable assets etc., and also perhaps the funds raised
			<lb />
			by SP group on the security/pledge of these shares. Therefore, at
			<lb />
			this stage and in this Court, we cannot adjudicate on the fair
			<lb />
			compensation. We will leave it to the parties to take the Article 75
			<lb />
			route or any other legally available route in this regard.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.5
			<lb />
			In the result, all the appeals except C.A. No.1802 of 2020
			<lb />
			are allowed and the order of NCLAT dated 18.12.2019 is set aside.
			<lb />
			The Company Petition C.P. No. 82 of 2016 filed before NCLT by the
			<lb />
			two Companies belonging to the S.P. Group shall stand dismissed.
			<lb />
			The appeal C.A. No.1802 of 2020 filed by Cyrus Investments Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd., and Sterling Investments Corporation Pvt. Ltd. is dismissed.
			<lb />
			There will be no order as to costs.
			<lb />
			All IAs including the one for causing separation of ownership
			<lb />
			interests of the S.P. Group in Tata Sons namely IA No.111387 of
			<lb />
			2020, are dismissed.
