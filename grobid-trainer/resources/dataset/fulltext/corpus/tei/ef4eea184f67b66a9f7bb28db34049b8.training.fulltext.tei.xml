			SANJIV KHANNA, J.
			<lb />
			This judgment decides the reference to three Judges made
			<lb />
			vide order dated 28 th February, 2019 in Civil Appeal No. 2402 of
			<lb />
			2019 titled Vidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading
			<lb />
			Corporation, 1 as it doubts the legal ratio expressed in Himangni
			<lb />
			Enterprises v. Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia 2 that landlord-tenant
			<lb />
			disputes governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property
			<lb />
			Act, 1882, are not arbitrable as this would be contrary to public
			<lb />
			policy.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			A deeper consideration of the order of reference reveals that the
			<lb />
			issues required to be answered relate to two aspects that are
			<lb />
			distinct and yet interconnected, namely:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(i) meaning of non-arbitrability and when the subject matter of
			<lb />
			the dispute is not capable of being resolved through
			<lb />
			arbitration; and
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) the conundrum -&quot;who decides&quot; -whether the court at the
			<lb />
			reference stage or the arbitral tribunal in the arbitration
			<lb />
			proceedings would decide the question of non-arbitrability.
			<lb />
			The second aspect also relates to the scope and ambit of
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage when an objection of
			<lb />
			non-arbitrability is raised to an application under Section 8 or 11
			<lb />
			of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, the
			<lb />
			&apos;Arbitration Act&apos;).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			We are not reproducing and examining the factual matrix, as we
			<lb />
			are only answering the legal issues raised. However, we would
			<lb />
			refer, in brief, to the legal reasoning and the ratio in Himangni
			<lb />
			Enterprises and the counter view expressed in the order of
			<lb />
			reference in Vidya Drolia.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			Himangni Enterprises upheld the decision of the High Court and
			<lb />
			the District Court rejecting the application filed by the defendant-
			<lb />
			tenant under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act in a civil suit seeking
			<lb />
			its eviction from a shop in a commercial complex in New Delhi. The
			<lb />
			suit was also for the recovery of arrears of rent and permanent
			<lb />
			injunction. The tenancy in question was not protected under the
			<lb />
			rent control legislation and the rights and obligations were
			<lb />
			governed by the Transfer of Property Act. Two Judges of this
			<lb />
			Court held that the issue of non-arbitrability is no longer res integra
			<lb />
			as it stood answered by decisions in Natraj Studios (P) Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Navrang Studios 3 and Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home
			<lb />
			Finance Ltd. 4 In Natraj Studios (P) Ltd., wherein an application
			<lb />
			under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 was dismissed as the
			<lb />
			tenancy was protected under the Bombay Rents, Hotel and
			<lb />
			Lodging Houses Rates Control Act, 1947, it was observed that on
			<lb />
			broader consideration of public policy, the arbitrator lacked
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to decide the question whether the licensee-landlord
			<lb />
			was entitled to seek possession. The dispute could be exclusively
			<lb />
			decided by the Court of Small Causes, which alone had
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. In Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., it was held that in
			<lb />
			eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes and
			<lb />
			where the tenant enjoys statutory protection, only the specified
			<lb />
			court has been conferred jurisdiction. Himangni Enterprises
			<lb />
			relying on the said ratios holds that though the Delhi Rent Act is
			<lb />
			not applicable, it does not follow that the Arbitration Act would be
			<lb />
			applicable so as to confer jurisdiction on the arbitrator. Even in
			<lb />
			cases of tenancies governed by the Transfer of Property Act, the
			<lb />
			dispute would be triable by the civil court and not by the arbitrator.
			<lb />
			The exemption from the applicability of the Rent Act could be
			<lb />
			withdrawn and thereupon the rights would be governed by the rent
			<lb />
			control legislation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			In Vidya Drolia, another division bench referring to Section 11(6-
			<lb />
			A) has observed that the referral stage requirement is to only
			<lb />
			examine &apos;existence of an arbitration agreement&apos; and not validity of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement. 246 th Report of the Law Commission of
			<lb />
			India had suggested twin examination whether the agreement
			<lb />
			&apos;exists&apos; or is &apos;null and void&apos;, albeit the Section 11(6-A), as enacted,
			<lb />
			requires &apos;existence of an arbitration agreement&apos;, and the
			<lb />
			prerequisite that the arbitration agreement should not be &apos;null and
			<lb />
			void&apos; was deliberately omitted. The wording of Section 11(6-A) was
			<lb />
			contrasted with Section 16(1) to draw distinction between &apos;validity
			<lb />
			of an arbitration agreement&apos; and &apos;existence of an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement&apos;.
			<lb />
			Reference was made to observations of Kurian
			<lb />
			Joseph, J. in Duro Felguera, S.A v. Gangavaram Port Limited, 5
			<lb />
			to the effect that the scope of Section 11(6-A) is limited, only to see
			<lb />
			whether an arbitration agreement exists -nothing more, nothing
			<lb />
			less. The legislative policy and purpose are to essentially minimize
			<lb />
			judicial intervention at the appointment stage. Referring to Sections
			<lb />
			111, 114 and 114A of the Transfer of Property Act, it is observed
			<lb />
			that there is nothing in this Act and law to show that a dispute
			<lb />
			relating to the determination of lease, arrears of rent etc. cannot be
			<lb />
			decided by an arbitrator. The grounds predicated on public policy
			<lb />
			could be raised before the arbitrator as they could be raised before
			<lb />
			the court. The arbitrator could well abide by the provisions of
			<lb />
			Sections 114 and 114A, and apply the public policy considerations
			<lb />
			for the protection of tenants as a class. Referring to Booz Allen &amp;
			<lb />
			Hamilton Inc., it was observed that the right in rem is a right
			<lb />
			exercisable against the world at large and is not amenable to
			<lb />
			arbitration, whereas in case of rights in personam an interest is
			<lb />
			protected against a specific individual, and is referable to
			<lb />
			arbitration. Further, subordinate rights in personam arising from
			<lb />
			rights in rem have always been considered to be arbitrable.
			<lb />
			Decision in Natraj Studios (P) Ltd. was distinguishable, as the
			<lb />
			rent control legislation being applicable, the tenancy disputes were
			<lb />
			to be exclusively decided by the small cause court in Bombay. The
			<lb />
			legislation had provided that no other court would have jurisdiction
			<lb />
			to entertain any suit, proceedings or deal with such claim or
			<lb />
			questions. The exception in the form of non-arbitrable landlord-
			<lb />
			tenant disputes, as per Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., was confined
			<lb />
			only to those cases/matters governed by: (i) special statues, (ii)
			<lb />
			where the tenant enjoys statutory protection and (iii) where only
			<lb />
			specific courts are conferred jurisdiction to decide disputes.
			<lb />
			Transfer of Property Act does not negate arbitrability. In Olympus
			<lb />
			Superstructures Pvt. Ltd. v. Meena Vijay Khetan and Others, 6 it
			<lb />
			was held that there is no prohibition in the Specific Relief Act, 1963
			<lb />
			for referring disputes relating to specific performance of contracts
			<lb />
			to arbitration. Equally, the discretion to refuse or grant specific
			<lb />
			performance would not militate against arbitrability. Reference was
			<lb />
			made to Vimal Kishor Shah and Others v. Jayesh Dinesh Shah
			<lb />
			and Other, 7 which had referred to Dhulabhai Etc. v. State of
			<lb />
			Madhya Pradesh and Another, 8 in the context of whether the
			<lb />
			disputes under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 were arbitrable. The
			<lb />
			disputes under the Trusts Act were held to be non-arbitrable by
			<lb />
			necessary implication, as the Trusts Act had conferred specific
			<lb />
			powers on the principal judge of the civil court, which powers an
			<lb />
			arbitrator could not exercise. The judgment in Vimal Kishor Shah
			<lb />
			was followed by another Division Bench in Emaar MGF Land
			<lb />
			Limited v. Aftab Singh, 9 a case relating to the Consumer
			<lb />
			Protection Act, 1986. Reasoning that the exemption from rent
			<lb />
			control legislation can be withdrawn and thereupon Arbitration Act
			<lb />
			would not apply, it was observed, was not a valid justification and
			<lb />
			ground to hold that the subject matter was not arbitrable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel for the parties have primarily relied upon the
			<lb />
			reasoning given in Himangni Enterprises and Vidya Drolia and
			<lb />
			have referred to other case law which we would subsequently
			<lb />
			examine. To avoid prolixity and repetition, we are not reproducing
			<lb />
			the respective contentions and arguments, as the same would be
			<lb />
			dealt with and appreciated during the course of our reasoning.
			<lb />
			However, we acknowledge that the oral submissions and
			<lb />
			compilations have been of immense help. Similarly, scholarly
			<lb />
			writings in books and articles expressing diverse views on non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability and Who Decides Non-arbitrability have facilitated us
			<lb />
			unclog the legal and jurisprudential nuances and contradictions to
			<lb />
			try and resolve the issues in the context of domestic law of
			<lb />
			arbitration in India.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			At the outset we begin with the caveat that this judgment does not
			<lb />
			examine and interpret the transnational provisions of arbitration in
			<lb />
			Part II of the Arbitration Act.

			8.
			<lb />
			Non-arbitrability is basic for arbitration as it relates to the very
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. An arbitral tribunal may lack
			<lb />
			jurisdiction for several reasons. Non-arbitrability has multiple
			<lb />
			meanings. Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. refers to three facets of
			<lb />
			non-arbitrability, namely: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(i) Whether the disputes are capable of adjudication
			<lb />
			and settlement by arbitration? That is, whether the
			<lb />
			disputes, having regard to their nature, could be
			<lb />
			resolved by a private forum chosen by the parties (the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal) or whether they would exclusively
			<lb />
			fall within the domain of public fora (courts).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Whether the disputes are covered by the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement? That is, whether the disputes
			<lb />
			are enumerated or described in the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement as matters to be decided by arbitration or
			<lb />
			whether the disputes fall under the &quot;excepted matters&quot;
			<lb />
			excluded from the purview of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Whether the parties have referred the disputes to
			<lb />
			arbitration? That is, whether the disputes fall under
			<lb />
			the scope of the submission to the Arbitral Tribunal, or
			<lb />
			whether they do not arise out of the statement of
			<lb />
			claim and the counterclaim filed before the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal. A dispute, even if it is capable of being
			<lb />
			decided by arbitration and falling within the scope of
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement, will not be &quot;arbitrable&quot; if it is
			<lb />
			not enumerated in the joint list of disputes referred to
			<lb />
			arbitration, or in the absence of such a joint list of
			<lb />
			disputes, does not form part of the disputes raised in
			<lb />
			the pleadings before the Arbitral Tribunal.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			John J. Barcelo III, in his paper titled &apos;Who Decides the
			<lb />
			Arbitrator&apos;s
			<lb />
			Jurisdiction?
			<lb />
			Separability
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			Competence-
			<lb />
			Competence in Transnational Perspective&apos;, 10 in the context of
			<lb />
			transnational commercial transactions, has divided facets relating
			<lb />
			to non-arbitrability into seven categories:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Stage 1# is crucial concerning whether arbitration is
			<lb />
			allowed to go forward efficaciously or is obstructed by
			<lb />
			court intervention. At Stage 1, a party opposing
			<lb />
			arbitration may raise any of a series of legal issues
			<lb />
			requiring court, rather than arbitrator, decision. These
			<lb />
			may include any or all of the following claims: (1) the
			<lb />
			container contract is invalid (for a reason that would not
			<lb />
			directly invalidate the arbitration clause); (2) no
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement came into existence between the
			<lb />
			parties; (3) an existing arbitration agreement is either
			<lb />
			formally invalid (for example, not in writing) or materially
			<lb />
			invalid (for example, violative of mandatory law); (4) a
			<lb />
			disputed issue is not within the scope of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement; (5) mandatory law prohibits a disputed
			<lb />
			issue, though within the scope of the parties&apos; arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement, to be arbitrated (a special type of material
			<lb />
			invalidity respecting a specific issue fraught with public
			<lb />
			policy concerns, such as (formerly) antitrust or
			<lb />
			securities fraud); (6) some precondition for permissible
			<lb />
			arbitration has not been met (for example, a time-limit
			<lb />
			on initiating arbitration); (7) the party seeking arbitration
			<lb />
			has waived its right to arbitrate or is estopped from
			<lb />
			claiming that right.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(#Stage 1 is the referral stage.)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Validity of the legal ratio in Himangni Enterprises cannot be
			<lb />
			decided without examining when a subject matter or dispute is
			<lb />
			non-arbitrable. Understanding of the different facets of non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability is important as it would help us appreciate the
			<lb />
			consequences. This would assist in deciding whether the court or
			<lb />
			the arbitral tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide the particular facet
			<lb />
			of non-arbitrability. The jurisdiction could well depend on the nature
			<lb />
			and type of the non-arbitrability alleged. The order of reference in
			<lb />
			Vidya Drolia draws distinction for the purpose of exercise of
			<lb />
			jurisdiction between non-arbitrability on account of existence and
			<lb />
			non-arbitrability on account of the validity of an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10.
			<lb />
			Arbitration is a private dispute resolution mechanism whereby two
			<lb />
			or more parties agree to resolve their current or future disputes by
			<lb />
			an arbitral tribunal, as an alternative to adjudication by the courts
			<lb />
			or a public forum established by law. Parties by mutual agreement
			<lb />
			forgo their right in law to have their disputes adjudicated in the
			<lb />
			courts/public forum. Arbitration agreement gives contractual
			<lb />
			authority to the arbitral tribunal to adjudicate the disputes and bind
			<lb />
			the parties. The expression &apos;arbitration agreement&apos; has been
			<lb />
			defined in clause (d) of sub-section (2) to mean an agreement as
			<lb />
			defined in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act. Section 7 of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act reads:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;7. Arbitration agreement. -(1) In this Part,
			<lb />
			&quot;arbitration agreement&quot; means an agreement by the
			<lb />
			parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes
			<lb />
			which have arisen or which may arise between them
			<lb />
			in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether
			<lb />
			contractual or not.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an
			<lb />
			arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a
			<lb />
			separate agreement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is
			<lb />
			contained in-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) a document signed by the parties;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or
			<lb />
			other means of telecommunication which provide
			<lb />
			a record of the agreement; or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) an exchange of statements of claim and
			<lb />
			defense in which the existence of the agreement
			<lb />
			is alleged by one party and not denied by the
			<lb />
			other.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(5) The reference in a contract to a document
			<lb />
			containing an arbitration clause constitutes an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing and
			<lb />
			the reference is such as to make that arbitration
			<lb />
			clause part of the contract.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			11.
			<lb />
			The term &apos;agreement&apos; is not defined in the Arbitration Act, albeit it is
			<lb />
			defined in Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (for short,
			<lb />
			the &apos;Contract Act&apos;), 11 as contracts made by free consent of parties
			<lb />
			competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful
			<lb />
			object, and are not thereby expressly declared to be void. Section
			<lb />
			10 of the Contract Act also stipulates that aforesaid requirements
			<lb />
			shall not affect any law in force in India (and not expressly
			<lb />
			repealed) by which a contract is required to be made in writing, in
			<lb />
			presence of witnesses or any law relating to registration of
			<lb />
			documents. Thus, an arbitration agreement should satisfy the
			<lb />
			mandate of Section 10 of the Contract Act, in addition to satisfying
			<lb />
			11 10. What agreements are contracts. -All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free
			<lb />
			consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are
			<lb />
			not hereby expressly declared to be void. Nothing herein contained shall affect any law in force in
			<lb />
			India, and not hereby expressly repealed, by which any contract is required to be made in writing or in
			<lb />
			the presence of witnesses, or any law relating to the registration of documents.
			<lb />
			other requirements stipulated in the Section 7 of the Arbitration Act.
			<lb />
			Sections 12 to 18 of the Contract Act state when a person can be
			<lb />
			said to be of a sound mind for the purpose of contracting and
			<lb />
			define the expressions &apos;consent&apos;, &apos;free consent&apos;, &apos;coercion&apos;, &apos;undue
			<lb />
			influence&apos;, &apos;fraud&apos; and &apos;misrepresentation&apos;. Sections 19 to 23 relate
			<lb />
			to voidability of agreements, the power to set aside contracts
			<lb />
			induced by undue influence, when both the parties are under
			<lb />
			mistake as to a matter of fact, effect of a mistake as to the law,
			<lb />
			effect of a mistake by one party as to a matter of fact and what
			<lb />
			considerations and objects are lawful and unlawful. Sections 24 to
			<lb />
			30 relate to void contracts and Sections 26 and 27 therein state
			<lb />
			that agreements in restraint of marriage and agreements in
			<lb />
			restraint of trade, respectively are void, albeit Explanation (1) to
			<lb />
			Section 27 saves agreements for not carrying out the business of
			<lb />
			which goodwill is sold. Section 28 of the Contract Act states that
			<lb />
			agreements in restraint of legal proceedings are void, but
			<lb />
			Explanation (1) specifically saves contracts by which two or more
			<lb />
			persons agree that any dispute, or one which may arise between
			<lb />
			them, in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be
			<lb />
			referred to arbitration. Arbitration agreement must satisfy the
			<lb />
			objective mandates of the law of contract to qualify as an
			<lb />
			agreement. Clauses (g) and (h) of Section 2 of the Contract Act
			<lb />
			state that an agreement not enforceable in law is void and an
			<lb />
			agreement enforceable in law is a contract. As a sequitur, it follows
			<lb />
			that an arbitration agreement that is not enforceable in law is void
			<lb />
			and not legally valid.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12.
			<lb />
			Sub-section (1) to Section 7 ordains that the arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			should be in respect of disputes arising from a defined legal
			<lb />
			relationship, whether contractual or not. The expression &apos;legal
			<lb />
			relationship&apos;, again not defined in the Arbitration Act, means a
			<lb />
			relationship which gives rise to legal obligations and duties and,
			<lb />
			therefore, confers a right. These rights may be contractual or even
			<lb />
			non-contractual. 12 Non-contractual disputes would require a
			<lb />
			separate or submission arbitration agreement based on the cause
			<lb />
			of action arising in tort, restitution, breach of statutory duty or some
			<lb />
			other non-contractual cause of action. 13
			<lb />
			12 Legal relationship will be normally followed by certain immediate or remote consequences in the
			<lb />
			form of action or non-action by the judicial and executive agents of the society as distinct from purely
			<lb />
			private affairs or other events which have nothing to do with law. Legal relationship exists in every
			<lb />
			situation that is or may be procedurally asserted for a declaration or denial of a right or for imposition
			<lb />
			of a sanction or any other purpose within the scope of adjudicative action. In actual practice, objection
			<lb />
			regarding defined legal relationship is seldom raised and tested.

			13.
			<lb />
			Sub-section (2) to Section 7 is of some importance as it states that
			<lb />
			an arbitration clause may be in the form of a separate agreement
			<lb />
			or form a part of the underlying or another contract. Clause (3) of
			<lb />
			Section 7 of the Arbitration Act states that the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement shall be in writing, that is, the agreement should be
			<lb />
			evidenced in writing. By clause (4) the term &apos;arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			in writing&apos; would include any agreement by exchange of letters,
			<lb />
			telegrams, electronic mails or communications which provide a
			<lb />
			record of the agreement or exchange of statements of claim and
			<lb />
			defence in which one party claims the existence of the agreement
			<lb />
			and the other party does not deny it. Sub-section (5) to Section 7
			<lb />
			states that reference in a contract to a document containing an
			<lb />
			arbitration clause would constitute a valid arbitration agreement if
			<lb />
			the contract is in writing and reference is made to the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause that forms a part of the contract.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14.
			<lb />
			Questions as to the existence of an arbitration agreement also
			<lb />
			arise when a party opposing the reference raises plea of novation
			<lb />
			of contract by entering into a new contract in substitution of the
			<lb />
			original or &apos;accord and satisfaction&apos; by acceptance of modified
			<lb />
			obligations in discharge of the contract by performance or simple
			<lb />
			termination by express or implied consent. Similar plea of
			<lb />
			discharge can be raised opposing an application for reference on
			<lb />
			the ground that the claim is long barred and dead or there are no
			<lb />
			outstanding disputes as the parties have accepted part
			<lb />
			performance or have absolved the other side from performance,
			<lb />
			fully or partly, on account of frustration or otherwise. The
			<lb />
			contention is that once the original contract stands extinguished,
			<lb />
			abandoned, repudiated or substituted, the arbitration clause in the
			<lb />
			underlying/original contract perishes with it.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.
			<lb />
			Arbitration being a matter of contract, the parties are entitled to fix
			<lb />
			boundaries as to confer and limit the jurisdiction and legal authority
			<lb />
			of the arbitrator. An arbitration agreement can be comprehensive
			<lb />
			and broad to include any dispute or could be confined to specific
			<lb />
			disputes. The issue of scope of arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction invariably
			<lb />
			arises when the disputes that are arbitrable are enumerated or the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement provides for exclusions as in case of
			<lb />
			&apos;excepted matters&apos;. The arbitration agreement may be valid, but
			<lb />
			the arbitral tribunal in view of the will of the parties expressed in
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement, may not have jurisdiction to adjudicate
			<lb />
			the dispute. The will of the parties as to the scope of arbitration is a
			<lb />
			subjective act and personal to the parties.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Another facet, not highlighted earlier, arises from the dictum in
			<lb />
			Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya and Another, 14
			<lb />
			a decision upholding rejection of an application under Section 8, on
			<lb />
			the ground that there is no provision in the Arbitration Act to
			<lb />
			bifurcate and divide the causes or parties, that is, the subject
			<lb />
			matter of the suit/judicial proceedings, and parties to the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. The suit should be in respect of a &apos;matter&apos; which the
			<lb />
			parties have agreed to refer and which comes within the ambit of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement. The words &apos;a matter&apos;, it was interpreted,
			<lb />
			would indicate that the entire subject matter of the suit should be
			<lb />
			subject to arbitration agreement. Bifurcation of subject matter or
			<lb />
			causes of action in the suit is not permissible and contemplated.
			<lb />
			Similarly, the parties to the suit should be bound by the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement, as there is no provision in the Arbitration Act to compel
			<lb />
			third persons who have not exercised the option to give up the
			<lb />
			right to have access to courts and be bound by the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause. This would violate party autonomy and consensual nature
			<lb />
			of arbitration. Bifurcation in such cases would result in a suit
			<lb />
			being divided into two parts, one being decided by the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal, and the other by the court or judicial authorities. This
			<lb />
			would defeat the entire purpose and inevitably delay the
			<lb />
			proceedings and increase cost of litigation, cause harassment and
			<lb />
			on occasions give rise to conflicting judgments and orders by two
			<lb />
			different fora. Cause of action in relation to the subject matter
			<lb />
			relates to the scope of the arbitration agreement and whether the
			<lb />
			dispute can be resolved by arbitration. Second mandate relating to
			<lb />
			common parties exposits the inherent limitation of the arbitration
			<lb />
			process which is consensual and mutual, an aspect we would
			<lb />
			subsequently examine.

			<lb />
			A two Judges&apos; Bench in Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., while
			<lb />
			interpreting the dictum in Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd., had drawn a
			<lb />
			distinction between ambit and scope of judicial inquiry while
			<lb />
			deciding an application under Section 8(1) of the Arbitration Act
			<lb />
			which is filed in pending civil suit/judicial proceedings and an
			<lb />
			application for reference of the dispute to arbitration under Section
			<lb />
			11 of the Arbitration Act. In Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. it was
			<lb />
			observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;32. The nature and scope of issues arising for
			<lb />
			consideration in an application under Section 11 of
			<lb />
			the Act for appointment of arbitrators, are far narrower
			<lb />
			than those arising in an application under Section 8 of
			<lb />
			the Act, seeking reference of the parties to a suit to
			<lb />
			arbitration. While considering an application under
			<lb />
			Section 11 of the Act, the Chief Justice or his
			<lb />
			designate would not embark upon an examination of
			<lb />
			the issue of &quot;arbitrability&quot; or appropriateness of
			<lb />
			adjudication by a private forum, once he finds that
			<lb />
			there was an arbitration agreement between or
			<lb />
			among the parties, and would leave the issue of
			<lb />
			arbitrability for the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. If
			<lb />
			the arbitrator wrongly holds that the dispute is
			<lb />
			arbitrable, the aggrieved party will have to challenge
			<lb />
			the award by filing an application under Section 34 of
			<lb />
			the Act, relying upon sub-section (2)(b)(i) of that
			<lb />
			section.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			However, in SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd. and
			<lb />
			Another, 15 the majority judgment of the Constitution Bench of
			<lb />
			seven Judges had noticed the complementary nature of Sections 8
			<lb />
			and 11 of the Arbitration Act, and has observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;16. We may at this stage notice the complementary
			<lb />
			nature of Sections 8 and 11. Where there is an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement between the parties and one of
			<lb />
			the parties, ignoring it, files an action before a judicial
			<lb />
			authority and the other party raises the objection that
			<lb />
			there is an arbitration clause, the judicial authority has
			<lb />
			to consider that objection and if the objection is found
			<lb />
			sustainable to refer the parties to arbitration. The
			<lb />
			expression used in this section is &quot;shall&quot; and this
			<lb />
			Court in P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P.V.G. Raju and
			<lb />
			in Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Pinkcity
			<lb />
			Midway Petroleums has held that the judicial authority
			<lb />
			is bound to refer the matter to arbitration once the
			<lb />
			existence of a valid arbitration clause is established.
			<lb />
			Thus, the judicial authority is entitled to, has to and is
			<lb />
			bound to decide the jurisdictional issue raised before
			<lb />
			it, before making or declining to make a reference.
			<lb />
			Section 11 only covers another situation. Where one
			<lb />
			of the parties has refused to act in terms of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, the other party moves the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice under Section 11 of the Act to have an
			<lb />
			arbitrator appointed and the first party objects, it
			<lb />
			would be incongruous to hold that the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			cannot decide the question of his own jurisdiction to
			<lb />
			appoint an arbitrator when in a parallel situation, the
			<lb />
			judicial authority can do so. Obviously, the highest
			<lb />
			judicial authority has to decide that question and his
			<lb />
			competence to decide cannot be questioned. If it is
			<lb />
			held that the Chief Justice has no right or duty to
			<lb />
			decide the question or cannot decide the question, it
			<lb />
			will lead to an anomalous situation in that a judicial
			<lb />
			authority under Section 8 can decide, but not a Chief
			<lb />
			Justice under Section 11, though the nature of the
			<lb />
			objection is the same and the consequence of
			<lb />
			accepting the objection in one case and rejecting it in
			<lb />
			the other, is also the same, namely, sending the
			<lb />
			parties to arbitration. The interpretation of Section 11
			<lb />
			that we have adopted would not give room for such
			<lb />
			an anomaly.&quot;
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			We are clearly bound by the dictum of the Constitutional
			<lb />
			Bench judgment in Patel Engineering Ltd. that the scope and
			<lb />
			ambit of court&apos;s jurisdiction under Section 8 or 11 of the Arbitration
			<lb />
			Act is similar. An application under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act
			<lb />
			need not set out in detail the disputes or the claims and may briefly
			<lb />
			refer to the subject matter or broad contours of the dispute.
			<lb />
			However, where judicial proceedings are initiated and pending,
			<lb />
			specific details of the claims and disputes are normally pleaded
			<lb />
			and, therefore, the court or the judicial authority has the advantage
			<lb />
			of these details. There is a difference between a non-arbitrable
			<lb />
			claim and non-arbitrable subject matter. Former may arise on
			<lb />
			account of scope of the arbitration agreement and also when the
			<lb />
			claim is not capable of being resolved through arbitration.
			<lb />
			Generally non-arbitrability of the subject matter would relate to
			<lb />
			non-arbitrability in law. Further, the decision in Sukanya Holdings
			<lb />
			(P) Ltd. has to be read along with subsequent judgment of this
			<lb />
			Court in Chloro Controls India Private Limited v. Severn Trent
			<lb />
			Water Purification Inc. and Others. 16 The effect of amendment
			<lb />
			by Act 3 of 2016 with retrospective effect from 20.10.2015 on
			<lb />
			Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act with the stipulation that the
			<lb />
			amendments apply notwithstanding any earlier judgment has been
			<lb />
			examined by us under the heading Who Decides Non-arbitrability.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.
			<lb />
			Sub-section (3) to Section 2 of the Arbitration Act states:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Section 2(3)-this Part shall not affect any other law
			<lb />
			for the time being in force by virtue of which certain
			<lb />
			disputes may not be submitted to arbitration.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The Arbitration Act clearly recognizes and accepts that
			<lb />
			certain disputes or subjects are not capable of being resolved by
			<lb />
			arbitration. Similarly, Section 34(2)(b)(i) of the Arbitration Act states
			<lb />
			that the courts may set aside awards when they find that &quot;the
			<lb />
			subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by
			<lb />
			arbitration&quot;. However, the two sub-sections conspicuously do not
			<lb />
			enumerate or categorize non-arbitrable matters or state the
			<lb />
			principles for determining when a dispute is non-arbitrable by
			<lb />
			virtue of any other law 17 for the time being in force. It is left to the
			<lb />
			courts by ex visceribus actus to formulate the principles for
			<lb />
			determining non-arbitrability. As, exclusion from arbitrability is
			<lb />
			predominantly a matter of case law, we begin by examining the
			<lb />
			case law on the subject.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.
			<lb />
			In Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., elucidating on the question of non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability of a dispute, it has been observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;35. The Arbitral Tribunals are private fora chosen
			<lb />
			voluntarily by the parties to the dispute, to adjudicate
			<lb />
			their disputes in place of courts and tribunals which
			<lb />
			are public fora constituted under the laws of the
			<lb />
			country. Every civil or commercial dispute, either
			<lb />
			contractual or non-contractual, which can be decided
			<lb />
			by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated
			<lb />
			and resolved by arbitration unless the jurisdiction of
			<lb />
			the Arbitral Tribunals is excluded either expressly or
			<lb />
			by necessary implication. Adjudication of certain
			<lb />
			categories of proceedings are reserved by the
			<lb />
			legislature exclusively for public fora as a matter of
			<lb />
			public policy. Certain other categories of cases,
			<lb />
			though not expressly reserved for adjudication by
			<lb />
			public fora (courts and tribunals), may by necessary
			<lb />
			implication stand excluded from the purview of private
			<lb />
			fora. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is
			<lb />
			inarbitrable, the court where a suit is pending, will
			<lb />
			refuse to refer the parties to arbitration, under Section
			<lb />
			8 of the Act, even if the parties might have agreed
			<lb />
			upon arbitration as the forum for settlement of such
			<lb />
			disputes.

		<item>
			37. It may be noticed that the cases referred to above
			<lb />
			relate to actions in rem. A right in rem is a right
			<lb />
			exercisable against the world at large, as contrasted
			<lb />
			from a right in personam which is an interest
			<lb />
			protected solely against specific individuals. Actions in
			<lb />
			personam refer to actions determining the rights and
			<lb />
			interests of the parties themselves in the subject-
			<lb />
			matter of the case, whereas actions in rem refer to
			<lb />
			actions determining the title to property and the rights
			<lb />
			of the parties, not merely among themselves but also
			<lb />
			against all persons at any time claiming an interest in
			<lb />
			that property. Correspondingly, a judgment in
			<lb />
			personam refers to a judgment against a person as
			<lb />
			distinguished from a judgment against a thing, right or
			<lb />
			status and a judgment in rem refers to a judgment
			<lb />
			that determines the status or condition of property
			<lb />
			which operates directly on the property itself. (Vide
			<lb />
			Black&apos;s Law Dictionary.)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			38. Generally and traditionally all disputes relating to
			<lb />
			rights in personam are considered to be amenable to
			<lb />
			arbitration; and all disputes relating to rights in rem
			<lb />
			are required to be adjudicated by courts and public
			<lb />
			tribunals, being unsuited for private arbitration. This is
			<lb />
			not however a rigid or inflexible rule. Disputes relating
			<lb />
			to subordinate rights in personam arising from rights
			<lb />
			in rem have always been considered to be arbitrable.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. states that civil or commercial
			<lb />
			dispute, whether contractual or non-contractual, which can be
			<lb />
			decided by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated and
			<lb />
			resolved by an arbitral tribunal unless the jurisdiction of the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal is either expressly or by necessary implication excluded.
			<lb />
			Legislature is entitled to exclusively reserve certain category of
			<lb />
			proceedings for public forums, be it a court or a forum created or
			<lb />
			empowered by the State to the exclusion of private forum.
			<lb />
			Exclusion of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal are matters of
			<lb />
			public policy. When public policy mandates and states that a case
			<lb />
			or a dispute is non-arbitrable, the court would not allow an
			<lb />
			application under Section 8 (or even Section 11 as observed
			<lb />
			supra) even if the parties have agreed upon arbitration as the
			<lb />
			mechanism for settlement of such disputes.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20.
			<lb />
			Exclusion or non-arbitrability when clearly expressed would pose
			<lb />
			no difficulty and should be respected. However, exclusion or non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability of subjects or disputes from the purview of a private
			<lb />
			forum like arbitration by necessary implication requires setting out
			<lb />
			the principles that should be applied.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.
			<lb />
			Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. draws a distinction between actions
			<lb />
			in personam, that is, actions which determine the rights and
			<lb />
			interests of parties themselves in the subject matter of the case,
			<lb />
			and actions in rem which refer to actions determining the title of the
			<lb />
			property and the rights of the parties not merely amongst
			<lb />
			themselves but also against all the persons at any time claiming an
			<lb />
			interest in that property. Rights in personam are considered to be
			<lb />
			amenable to arbitration and disputes regarding rights in rem are
			<lb />
			required to be adjudicated by the courts and public tribunals. The
			<lb />
			latter actions are unsuitable for private arbitration. Disputes
			<lb />
			relating to subordinate rights in personam arising from rights in
			<lb />
			rem are considered to be arbitrable. Paragraph 36 of the judgment
			<lb />
			in Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. refers to certain examples of non-
			<lb />
			arbitrable disputes and reads:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;36. The well-recognised examples of non-arbitrable
			<lb />
			disputes are: (i) disputes relating to rights and
			<lb />
			liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal
			<lb />
			offenses; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce,
			<lb />
			judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child
			<lb />
			custody; (iii) guardianship matters; (iv) insolvency and
			<lb />
			winding-up matters; (v) testamentary matters (grant of
			<lb />
			probate, letters of administration and succession
			<lb />
			certificate); and (vi) eviction or tenancy matters
			<lb />
			governed by special statutes where the tenant enjoys
			<lb />
			statutory protection against eviction and only the
			<lb />
			specified courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant
			<lb />
			eviction or decide the disputes.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			22.
			<lb />
			Landlord-tenant disputes governed by rent control legislation are
			<lb />
			not actions in rem, yet they are non-arbitrable. In Booz Allen &amp;
			<lb />
			Hamilton Inc. reference was made to Russell on Arbitration (22 nd
			<lb />
			Edition) in Para 2.007 at Page 28 wherein the author has observed
			<lb />
			that certain matters in English Law are reserved for the court alone
			<lb />
			and if an arbitral tribunal purports to deal with them the resulting
			<lb />
			award would be unenforceable. These matters would include
			<lb />
			where the type of remedy required is not one which the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal is empowered to give. Reference was made to Law and
			<lb />
			Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England (2 nd Ed. 1989) by
			<lb />
			Mustill and Boyd which states that certain types of remedies which
			<lb />
			the arbitrator can award are limited by consideration of public
			<lb />
			policy and as arbitrator is appointed by the parties and not by the
			<lb />
			State. Arbitrator cannot impose fine, give imprisonment, commit a
			<lb />
			person for contempt or issue a writ of subpoena nor can he make
			<lb />
			an award binding on third parties and affect public at large, such as
			<lb />
			a judgment in rem. Mustill and Boyd in their 2001 Companion
			<lb />
			Volume have observed that axiomatically rights that are valid as
			<lb />
			against the whole world, cannot be a subject of private arbitration,
			<lb />
			although subordinate rights in personam derived from such rights
			<lb />
			may be ruled upon by the arbitrators. Therefore, rights under a
			<lb />
			patent license may be arbitrated but the validity of the underlying
			<lb />
			patent may not be arbitrable. Similarly, an arbitrator who derives its
			<lb />
			power from a private agreement between A and B, plainly has no
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to bind a third person by a decision on whether the
			<lb />
			patent is valid or not, for no one else has mandated him to make
			<lb />
			the decision and the decision which attempts to do so would be
			<lb />
			useless.

			<lb />
			Analysing provisions of Order XXXIV of the Code of Civil
			<lb />
			Procedure, 1908, Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. holds that this
			<lb />
			Order not only relates to execution of a decree, it provides for
			<lb />
			preliminary and final decrees to satisfy the substantive rights of
			<lb />
			mortgagees with reference to their mortgage security. The
			<lb />
			provisions of Transfer of Property Act read with the Code relating
			<lb />
			to mortgage suits makes it clear that all persons having interest
			<lb />
			either in the mortgage security or in the right of redemption have to
			<lb />
			be joined as parties whether they are parties to the mortgage or
			<lb />
			not. The object of the provisions is to avoid multiplicity of
			<lb />
			suits/proceedings and to enable all the interested persons to raise
			<lb />
			their defences and claims, which are to be taken note of while
			<lb />
			dealing with the claim in the mortgage suit. By passing a
			<lb />
			preliminary decree or final decree, the court adjudicates, adjusts
			<lb />
			and safeguards the interests of not only the mortgager or
			<lb />
			mortgagee but also puisne/mesne mortgagees, persons entitled to
			<lb />
			the equity of redemption, persons having an interest in the
			<lb />
			mortgaged property, auction-purchasers and persons in
			<lb />
			possession, which an arbitral tribunal cannot do. Therefore, a suit
			<lb />
			for foreclosure or redemption of mortgage property can be dealt
			<lb />
			with by a public forum and not by a private forum.

			D.Y. Chandrachud, J. in A. Ayyasamy v. A. Paramasivam and
			<lb />
			Others, 18 referring to the dictum in Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc.,
			<lb />
			has made two important comments:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;35...This Court held that this class of actions
			<lb />
			operates in rem, which is a right exercisable against
			<lb />
			the world at large as contrasted with a right in
			<lb />
			personam which is an interest protected against
			<lb />
			specified individuals. All disputes relating to rights in
			<lb />
			personam are considered to be amenable to
			<lb />
			arbitration while rights in rem are required to be
			<lb />
			adjudicated by courts and public tribunals...
			<lb />
			xx
			<lb />
			xx
			<lb />
			xx
			<lb />
			38. Hence, in addition to various classes of disputes
			<lb />
			which are generally considered by the courts as
			<lb />
			appropriate for decision by public fora, there are
			<lb />
			classes of disputes which fall within the exclusive
			<lb />
			domain of special fora under legislation which confers
			<lb />
			exclusive jurisdiction to the exclusion of an ordinarily
			<lb />
			civil court. That such disputes are not arbitrable
			<lb />
			dovetails with the general principle that a dispute
			<lb />
			which is capable of adjudication by an ordinary civil
			<lb />
			court is also capable of being resolved by arbitration.
			<lb />
			However, if the jurisdiction of an ordinary civil court is
			<lb />
			excluded by the conferment of exclusive jurisdiction
			<lb />
			on a specified court or tribunal as a matter of public
			<lb />
			policy such a dispute would not then be capable of
			<lb />
			resolution by arbitration.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			In Vimal Kishor Shah disputes relating to private trusts, trustees,
			<lb />
			and beneficiaries of the trust and the Trusts Act were held to be
			<lb />
			non-arbitrable. The Order of Reference explains why disputes
			<lb />
			under the Trusts Act are non-arbitrable by necessary implication,
			<lb />
			for which reference was made to few sections of the Trusts Act to
			<lb />
			demonstrate how the disputes could not be made the subject
			<lb />
			matter of arbitration. The reasoning is illustrative and elucidating: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;27...Under Section 34 of the Indian Trusts Act, a
			<lb />
			trustee may, without instituting a suit, apply by petition
			<lb />
			to a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction for its
			<lb />
			opinion, advice, or direction on any present questions
			<lb />
			respecting management or administration of trust
			<lb />
			property, subject to other conditions laid down in the
			<lb />
			Section. Obviously, an arbitrator cannot possibly give
			<lb />
			such opinion, advice, or direction. Under Section 46, a
			<lb />
			trustee who has accepted the trust, cannot afterward
			<lb />
			renounce it, except, inter alia, with the permission of a
			<lb />
			principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction. This again
			<lb />
			cannot be the subject matter of arbitration. Equally,
			<lb />
			under Section 49 of the Indian Trusts Act, where a
			<lb />
			discretionary power conferred on a trustee is not
			<lb />
			exercised reasonably and in good faith, only a
			<lb />
			principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction can control
			<lb />
			such power, again making it clear that a private
			<lb />
			consensual adjudicator has no part in the scheme of
			<lb />
			this Act. Under Section 53, no trustee may, without
			<lb />
			the permission of a principal Civil Court of original
			<lb />
			jurisdiction, buy or become mortgagee or lessee of
			<lb />
			the trust property or any part thereof. Here again,
			<lb />
			such permission can only be given by an arm of the
			<lb />
			State, namely, the principal Civil Court of original
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. Under Section 74 of the Indian Trusts Act,
			<lb />
			under certain circumstances, a beneficiary may apply
			<lb />
			by petition to a principal Civil Court of original
			<lb />
			jurisdiction for the appointment of a trustee or a new
			<lb />
			trustee, and the Court may appoint such trustee
			<lb />
			accordingly. Here again, such an appointment cannot
			<lb />
			possibly be by a consensual adjudicator. It can only
			<lb />
			be done by a petition to a principal Civil Court of
			<lb />
			original jurisdiction. Also, it is important to note that it
			<lb />
			is not any civil court that has jurisdiction, but only one
			<lb />
			designated court, namely, a principal Civil Court of
			<lb />
			original jurisdiction. All this goes to show that by
			<lb />
			necessary implication, disputes arising under the
			<lb />
			Indian Trusts Act cannot possibly be referred to
			<lb />
			arbitration.&quot;

			In Emaar MGF Land Limited, the Division Bench referred to the
			<lb />
			object and the purpose behind the Consumer Protection Act, 1986
			<lb />
			as a law that meets the long-felt necessity of protecting the
			<lb />
			common man as a consumer against wrongs and misdeeds for
			<lb />
			which the remedy under the ordinary law has become illusory as
			<lb />
			the enforcement machinery does not move, or moves ineffectively
			<lb />
			or inefficiently. Thus, to remove helplessness and empower
			<lb />
			consumers against powerful businesses and the might of the
			<lb />
			public bodies, the enactment has constituted consumer forums
			<lb />
			with extensive and wide powers to award, wherever appropriate,
			<lb />
			compensations to the consumers and to impose penalties for non-
			<lb />
			compliance with their orders. The Consumer Protection Act has
			<lb />
			specific provisions for execution and effective implementation of
			<lb />
			their orders which powers are far greater than the power of the
			<lb />
			ordinary civil court. After referring to the amendments made to
			<lb />
			Sections 8 and 11 of Arbitration Act by Act No. 3 of 2016, it was
			<lb />
			observed that the amendments cannot be given such expansive
			<lb />
			meaning so as to inundate entire regime of special legislation
			<lb />
			where such disputes are not arbitrable. This amendment was not
			<lb />
			intended to side-line or override the settled law on non-arbitrability.
			<lb />
			Reference was made to an earlier decision in Premier
			<lb />
			Automobiles Ltd. v. Kamlekar Shantaram Wadke of Bombay
			<lb />
			and Others 19 wherein examining Section 9 of the Code of Civil
			<lb />
			Procedure in the context of rights and remedies under Industrial
			<lb />
			Disputes Act, 1947 it was observed that the legislature has made
			<lb />
			provisions for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes
			<lb />
			between unions representing the workmen and the management.
			<lb />
			The authorities constituted under the Act have extensive powers in
			<lb />
			the matter of industrial disputes. Labour Court and Tribunal can lay
			<lb />
			down new industrial policy for industrial peace and order, or
			<lb />
			reinstatement of dismissed workmen, which no civil court can do.
			<lb />
			For this, the provisions of Industrial Disputes Act completely oust
			<lb />
			the jurisdiction of the civil court for trial of the industrial disputes.
			<lb />
			The intent of the legislature is to protect the interest of workmen
			<lb />
			and consumers in larger public interest in the form of special rights
			<lb />
			and by constituting a judicial forum with powers that a civil court or
			<lb />
			an arbitrator cannot exercise. Neither the workmen nor consumers
			<lb />
			can waive their right to approach the statutory judicial forums by
			<lb />
			opting for arbitration.

			In Olympus Superstructures Pvt. Ltd., this Court had held that
			<lb />
			an arbitrator can grant specific performance as there is no
			<lb />
			prohibition in the Specific Relief Act, 1963. This decision on the
			<lb />
			question of arbitrability has observed, and in our humble opinion
			<lb />
			rightly, as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;34. In our opinion, the view taken by the Punjab,
			<lb />
			Bombay and Calcutta High Courts is the correct one
			<lb />
			and the view taken by the Delhi High Court is not
			<lb />
			correct. We are of the view that the right to specific
			<lb />
			performance of an agreement of sale deals with
			<lb />
			contractual rights and it is certainly open to the parties
			<lb />
			to agree -with a view to shorten litigation in regular
			<lb />
			courts -to refer the issues relating to specific
			<lb />
			performance to arbitration. There is no prohibition in
			<lb />
			the Specific Relief Act, 1963 that issues relating to
			<lb />
			specific performance of a contract relating to
			<lb />
			immovable property cannot be referred to arbitration.
			<lb />
			Nor is there such a prohibition contained in the
			<lb />
			Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 as contrasted
			<lb />
			with Section 15 of the English Arbitration Act, 1950 or
			<lb />
			Section 48(5)(b) of the English Arbitration Act, 1996
			<lb />
			which contained a prohibition relating to specific
			<lb />
			performance of contracts concerning immovable
			<lb />
			property.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			35. It is stated in Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England, 4th
			<lb />
			Edn., (Arbitration, Vol. 2, para 503) as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;503. Nature of the dispute or difference.-The
			<lb />
			dispute or difference which the parties to an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement agree to refer must consist of
			<lb />
			a justiciable issue triable civilly. A fair test of this is
			<lb />
			whether the difference can be compromised
			<lb />
			lawfully by way of accord and satisfaction (Cf. Bac
			<lb />
			Abr Arbitrament and Award A).&quot;

			28.
			<lb />
			In V.H. Patel &amp; Company and Others v. Hirubhai Himabhai
			<lb />
			Patel and Others, 20 this Court has held that in deference to the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause covering all matters there was no principle of law
			<lb />
			or provision that bars an arbitrator from deciding whether the
			<lb />
			dissolution of a partnership is just and equitable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			29.
			<lb />
			Having examined and analysed the judgments, we would coalesce
			<lb />
			and crystalize the legal principles for determining non-arbitrability.
			<lb />
			We begin by drawing principles that draw distinction between
			<lb />
			adjudication of actions in rem and adjudication of actions in
			<lb />
			personam.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			30.
			<lb />
			A judgment is a formal expression of conclusive adjudication of the
			<lb />
			rights and liabilities of the parties. The judgment may operate in
			<lb />
			two ways, in rem or in personam. Section 41 of the Indian
			<lb />
			Evidence Act, 1872 on the question of relevancy of judgments in
			<lb />
			the context of conclusiveness of a judgment, order or decree
			<lb />
			provides:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;41. Relevancy of certain judgments in probate,
			<lb />
			etc., jurisdiction.-A final judgment, order or decree
			<lb />
			of a competent Court, in the exercise of probate,
			<lb />
			matrimonial admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction which
			<lb />
			confers upon or takes away from any person any
			<lb />
			legal character, or which declares any person to be
			<lb />
			entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any
			<lb />
			specific thing, not as against any specified person but
			<lb />
			absolutely, is relevant when the existence of any such
			<lb />
			legal character, or the title of any such person to any
			<lb />
			such thing, is relevant.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Such judgment, order or decree is conclusive
			<lb />
			proof-
			<lb />
			that any legal character, which it confers
			<lb />
			accrued at the time when such judgment,
			<lb />
			order or decree came into operation;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			that any legal character, to which it declares
			<lb />
			any such person to be entitled, accrued to
			<lb />
			that person at the time when such judgment,
			<lb />
			[order or decree] declares it to have accrued
			<lb />
			to that person;
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			that any legal character which it takes away
			<lb />
			from any such person ceased at the time from
			<lb />
			which such judgment, [order or decree]
			<lb />
			declared that it had ceased or should cease;
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			and that anything to which it declares any
			<lb />
			person to be so entitled was the property of
			<lb />
			that person at the time from which such
			<lb />
			judgment, [order or decree] declares that it
			<lb />
			had been or should be his property.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			A judgment in rem determines the status of a person or thing
			<lb />
			as distinct from the particular interest in it of a party to the litigation;
			<lb />
			and such a judgment is conclusive evidence for and against all
			<lb />
			persons whether parties, privies or strangers of the matter actually
			<lb />
			decided. Such a judgment &quot;settles the destiny of the res itself&quot; and
			<lb />
			binds all persons claiming an interest in the property inconsistent
			<lb />
			with the judgment even though pronounced in their absence. 21 By
			<lb />
			contrast, a judgment in personam, &quot;although it may concern a res,
			<lb />
			merely determines the rights of the litigants inter se to the res&quot;. 22
			<lb />
			Distinction between judgments in rem and judgments in personam
			<lb />
			turns on their power as res judicata, 23 i.e. judgment in rem would
			<lb />
			operate as res judicata against the world, and judgment in
			<lb />
			personam would operate as res judicata only against the parties in
			<lb />
			dispute. Use of expressions &quot;rights in rem&quot; and &quot;rights in
			<lb />
			personam&quot; may not be correct for determining non-arbitrability
			<lb />
			because of the inter-play between rights in rem and rights in
			<lb />
			personam. Many a times, a right in rem results in an enforceable
			<lb />
			right in personam. Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. refers to the
			<lb />
			statement by Mustill and Boyd that the subordinate rights in
			<lb />
			personam derived from rights in rem can be ruled upon by the
			<lb />
			arbitrators, which is apposite. Therefore, a claim for infringement of
			<lb />
			copyright against a particular person is arbitrable, though in some
			<lb />
			manner the arbitrator would examine the right to copyright, a right
			<lb />
			in rem. Arbitration by necessary implication excludes actions in
			<lb />
			rem.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31.
			<lb />
			Exclusion of actions in rem from arbitration, exposits the intrinsic
			<lb />
			limits of arbitration as a private dispute resolution mechanism,
			<lb />
			which is only binding on &apos;the parties&apos; to the arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
			The courts established by law on the other hand enjoy jurisdiction
			<lb />
			by default and do not require mutual agreement for conferring
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunals not being courts of law or
			<lb />
			established under the auspices of the State cannot act judicially so
			<lb />
			as to affect those who are not bound by the arbitration clause.
			<lb />
			Arbitration is unsuitable when it has erga omnes effect, that is, it
			<lb />
			affects the rights and liabilities of persons who are not bound by
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement. Equally arbitration as a decentralized
			<lb />
			mode of dispute resolution is unsuitable when the subject matter or
			<lb />
			a dispute in the factual background, requires collective adjudication
			<lb />
			before one court or forum. Certain disputes as a class, or
			<lb />
			sometimes the dispute in the given facts, can be efficiently
			<lb />
			resolved only through collective litigation proceedings. Contractual
			<lb />
			and consensual nature of arbitration underpins its ambit and
			<lb />
			scope. Authority and power being derived from an agreement
			<lb />
			cannot bind and is non-effective against non-signatories. An
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement between two or more parties would be limpid
			<lb />
			and inexpedient in situations when the subject matter or dispute
			<lb />
			affects the rights and interests of third parties or without presence
			<lb />
			of others, an effective and enforceable award is not possible.
			<lb />
			Prime objective of arbitration to secure just, fair and effective
			<lb />
			resolution of disputes, without unnecessary delay and with least
			<lb />
			expense, is crippled and mutilated when the rights and liabilities of
			<lb />
			persons who have not consented to arbitration are affected or the
			<lb />
			collective resolution of the disputes by including non-parties is
			<lb />
			required. Arbitration agreement as an alternative to public fora
			<lb />
			should not be enforced when it is futile, ineffective, and would be a
			<lb />
			no result exercise. 24

			<lb />
			Sovereign functions of the State being inalienable and non-
			<lb />
			delegable are non-arbitrable as the State alone has the exclusive
			<lb />
			24 Prof. Stavros Brekoulakis -&apos;On Arbitrability: Persisting Misconceptions and New Areas of
			<lb />
			Concern&apos;
			<lb />
			right and duty to perform such functions. 25 For example, it is
			<lb />
			generally accepted that monopoly rights can only be granted by
			<lb />
			the State.
			<lb />
			Correctness and validity of the State or sovereign
			<lb />
			functions cannot be made a direct subject matter of a private
			<lb />
			adjudicatory process. Sovereign functions for the purpose of
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act would extend to exercise of executive power in
			<lb />
			different fields including commerce and economic, legislation in all
			<lb />
			forms, taxation, eminent domain and police powers which includes
			<lb />
			maintenance of law and order, internal security, grant of pardon
			<lb />
			etc., as distinguished from commercial activities, economic
			<lb />
			adventures and welfare activities. 26 Similarly, decisions and
			<lb />
			adjudicatory functions of the State that have public interest
			<lb />
			element like the legitimacy of marriage, citizenship, winding up of
			<lb />
			companies, grant of patents, etc. are non-arbitrable, unless the
			<lb />
			statute in relation to a regulatory or adjudicatory mechanism either
			<lb />
			expressly or by clear implication permits arbitration. In these
			<lb />
			matters the State enjoys monopoly in dispute resolution.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Fourth principle of non-arbitrability is alluded to in the Order of
			<lb />
			Reference, which makes specific reference to Vimal Kishor Shah,
			<lb />
			25 Ajar Raib -Defining Contours of the Public Policy Exception -A New Test for Arbitrability
			<lb />
			26 Common Cause v. Union of India, (1999) 6 SCC 667 and Agricultural Produce Market Committee
			<lb />
			v. Ashok Harikuni &amp; Another, (2000) 8 SCC 61.
			<lb />
			38
			<lb />
			which decision quotes from Dhulabhai, a case which dealt with
			<lb />
			exclusion of jurisdiction of civil courts under Section 9 of the Civil
			<lb />
			Procedure Code. The second condition in Dhulabhai reads as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;32. (2) Where there is an express bar of the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the court, an examination of the scheme
			<lb />
			of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the
			<lb />
			sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant
			<lb />
			but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil
			<lb />
			court.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Where there is no express exclusion the examination
			<lb />
			of the remedies and the scheme of the particular Act
			<lb />
			to find out the intendment becomes necessary and
			<lb />
			the result of the inquiry may be decisive. In the latter
			<lb />
			case, it is necessary to see if the statute creates a
			<lb />
			special right or a liability and provides for the
			<lb />
			determination of the right or liability and further lays
			<lb />
			down that all questions about the said right and
			<lb />
			liability shall be determined by the tribunals so
			<lb />
			constituted, and whether remedies normally
			<lb />
			associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed
			<lb />
			by the said statute or not.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The order of reference notes that Dhulabhai refers to three
			<lb />
			categories mentioned in Wolverhampton New Waterworks Co. v.
			<lb />
			Hawkesford, 27 to the following effect:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;There are three classes of cases in which a liability
			<lb />
			may be established founded upon a statute. One is,
			<lb />
			where there was a liability existing at common law,
			<lb />
			and that liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a
			<lb />
			special and peculiar form of remedy different from the
			<lb />
			remedy which existed at common law; there, unless
			<lb />
			the statute contains words which expressly or by
			<lb />
			necessary implication exclude the common law
			<lb />
			remedy, and the party suing has his election to pursue
			<lb />
			either that or the statutory remedy. The second class
			<lb />
			of cases is, where the statute gives the right to sue
			<lb />
			merely, but provides no particular form of remedy:
			<lb />
			there, the party can only proceed by action at
			<lb />
			common law. But there is a third class, viz. where a
			<lb />
			liability not existing at common law is created by a
			<lb />
			statute which at the same time gives a special and
			<lb />
			particular remedy for enforcing it.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Dhulabhai&apos;s case is not directly applicable as it relates to
			<lb />
			exclusion of jurisdiction of civil courts, albeit we respectfully agree
			<lb />
			with the Order of Reference that the condition No. 2 is apposite
			<lb />
			while examining the question of non-arbitrability. Implied legislative
			<lb />
			intention to exclude arbitration can be seen if it appears that the
			<lb />
			statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for
			<lb />
			determination of the right and liability to be dealt with by the
			<lb />
			specified courts or the tribunals specially constituted in that behalf
			<lb />
			and further lays down that all questions about the said right and
			<lb />
			liability shall be determined by the court or tribunals so empowered
			<lb />
			and vested with exclusive jurisdiction. Therefore, mere creation of
			<lb />
			a specific forum as a substitute for civil court or specifying the civil
			<lb />
			court, may not be enough to accept the inference of implicit non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability. Conferment of jurisdiction on a specific court or
			<lb />
			creation of a public forum though eminently significant, may not be
			<lb />
			the decisive test to answer and decide whether arbitrability is
			<lb />
			impliedly barred.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			34.
			<lb />
			Implicit non-arbitrability is established when by mandatory law the
			<lb />
			parties are quintessentially barred from contracting out and waiving
			<lb />
			the adjudication by the designated court or the specified public
			<lb />
			forum. There is no choice. The person who insists on the remedy
			<lb />
			must seek his remedy before the forum stated in the statute and
			<lb />
			before no other forum. In Transcore v. Union of India and
			<lb />
			Another, 28 this Court had examined the doctrine of election in the
			<lb />
			context whether an order under proviso to Section 19(1) of the
			<lb />
			Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions
			<lb />
			Act,1993 (the &apos;DRT Act&apos;) is a condition precedent to taking
			<lb />
			recourse to the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
			<lb />
			Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (the &apos;NPA
			<lb />
			Act&apos;). For analysing the scope and remedies under the two Acts, it
			<lb />
			was held that NPA Act is an additional remedy which is not
			<lb />
			inconsistent with the DRT Act, and reference was made to the
			<lb />
			doctrine of election in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;64. In the light of the above discussion, we now
			<lb />
			examine the doctrine of election. There are three
			<lb />
			elements of election, namely, existence of two or
			<lb />
			more remedies; inconsistencies between such
			<lb />
			remedies and a choice of one of them. If anyone of
			<lb />
			the three elements is not there, the doctrine will not
			<lb />
			apply. According to American Jurisprudence, 2d, Vol.
			<lb />
			25, p. 652, if in truth there is only one remedy, then
			<lb />
			the doctrine of election does not apply. In the present
			<lb />
			case, as stated above, the NPA Act is an additional
			<lb />
			remedy to the DRT Act. Together they constitute one
			<lb />
			remedy and, therefore, the doctrine of election does
			<lb />
			not apply. Even according to Snell&apos;s Principles of
			<lb />
			Equity (31st Edn., p. 119), the doctrine of election of
			<lb />
			remedies is applicable only when there are two or
			<lb />
			more co-existent remedies available to the litigants at
			<lb />
			the time of election which are repugnant and
			<lb />
			inconsistent. In any event, there is no repugnancy nor
			<lb />
			inconsistency between the two remedies, therefore,
			<lb />
			the doctrine of election has no application.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Doctrine of election to select arbitration as a dispute
			<lb />
			resolution mechanism by mutual agreement is available only if the
			<lb />
			law accepts existence of arbitration as an alternative remedy and
			<lb />
			freedom to choose is available. There should not be any
			<lb />
			inconsistency or repugnancy between the provisions of the
			<lb />
			mandatory law and arbitration as an alternative. Conversely and in
			<lb />
			a given case when there is repugnancy and inconsistency, the right
			<lb />
			of choice and election to arbitrate is denied. This requires
			<lb />
			examining the &quot;text of the statute, the legislative history, and
			<lb />
			&apos;inherent conflict&apos; between arbitration and the statute&apos;s underlying
			<lb />
			purpose&quot; 29 with reference to the nature and type of special rights
			<lb />
			conferred and power and authority given to the courts or public
			<lb />
			forum to effectuate and enforce these rights and the orders
			<lb />
			passed. When arbitration cannot enforce and apply such rights or
			<lb />
			the award cannot be implemented and enforced in the manner as
			<lb />
			provided and mandated by law, the right of election to choose
			<lb />
			arbitration in preference to the courts or public forum is either
			<lb />
			completely denied or could be curtailed. In essence, it is necessary
			<lb />
			to examine if the statute creates a special right or liability and
			<lb />
			provides for the determination of each right or liability by the
			<lb />
			specified court or the public forum so constituted, and whether the
			<lb />
			remedies beyond the ordinary domain of the civil courts are
			<lb />
			prescribed. When the answer is affirmative, arbitration in the
			<lb />
			absence of special reason is contraindicated. The dispute is non-
			<lb />
			arbitrable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			35.
			<lb />
			In M.D. Frozen Foods Exports Private Limited and Others v.
			<lb />
			Hero Fincorp Limited, 30 and following this judgment in Indiabulls
			<lb />
			Housing Finance Limited v. Deccan Chronicle Holdings
			<lb />
			Limited and Others, 31 it has been held that even prior arbitration
			<lb />
			proceedings are not a bar to proceedings under the NPA Act. The
			<lb />
			NPA Act sets out an expeditious, procedural methodology enabling
			<lb />
			the financial institutions to take possession and sell secured
			<lb />
			properties for non-payment of the dues. Such powers, it is obvious,
			<lb />
			cannot be exercised through the arbitral proceedings.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			36.
			<lb />
			In Transcore, on the powers of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT)
			<lb />
			under the DRT Act, it was observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;18. On analysing the above provisions of the DRT
			<lb />
			Act, we find that the said Act is a complete code by
			<lb />
			itself as far as recovery of debt is concerned. It
			<lb />
			provides for various modes of recovery. It
			<lb />
			incorporates even the provisions of the Second and
			<lb />
			Third Schedules to the Income Tax Act, 1961.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the debt due under the recovery certificate
			<lb />
			can be recovered in various ways. The remedies
			<lb />
			mentioned therein are complementary to each other.
			<lb />
			The DRT Act provides for adjudication. It provides for
			<lb />
			adjudication of disputes as far as the debt due is
			<lb />
			concerned. It covers secured as well as unsecured
			<lb />
			debts. However, it does not rule out the applicability of
			<lb />
			the provisions of the TP Act, in particular, Sections 69
			<lb />
			and 69-A of that Act. Further, in cases where the debt
			<lb />
			is secured by a pledge of shares or immovable
			<lb />
			properties, with the passage of time and delay in the
			<lb />
			DRT proceedings, the value of the pledged assets or
			<lb />
			mortgaged properties invariably falls. On account of
			<lb />
			inflation, the value of the assets in the hands of the
			<lb />
			bank/FI invariably depletes which, in turn, leads to
			<lb />
			asset-liability mismatch. These contingencies are not
			<lb />
			taken care of by the DRT Act and, therefore,
			<lb />
			Parliament had to enact the NPA Act, 2002.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Consistent with the above, observations in Transcore on the
			<lb />
			power of the DRT conferred by the DRT Act and the principle
			<lb />
			enunciated in the present judgment, we must overrule the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court in HDFC Bank
			<lb />
			Ltd. v. Satpal Singh Bakshi, 32 which holds that matters covered
			<lb />
			under the DRT Act are arbitrable. It is necessary to overrule this
			<lb />
			decision and clarify the legal position as the decision in HDFC
			<lb />
			Bank Ltd. has been referred to in M.D. Frozen Foods Exports
			<lb />
			Private Limited, but not examined in light of the legal principles
			<lb />
			relating to non-arbitrability. Decision in HDFC Bank Ltd. holds that
			<lb />
			only actions in rem are non-arbitrable, which as elucidated above
			<lb />
			is the correct legal position. However, non-arbitrability may arise in
			<lb />
			case the implicit prohibition in the statute, conferring and creating
			<lb />
			special rights to be adjudicated by the courts/public fora, which
			<lb />
			right including enforcement of order/provisions cannot be enforced
			<lb />
			and applied in case of arbitration. To hold that the claims of banks
			<lb />
			and financial institutions covered under the DRT Act are arbitrable
			<lb />
			would deprive and deny these institutions of the specific rights
			<lb />
			including the modes of recovery specified in the DRT Act.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the claims covered by the DRT Act are non-arbitrable
			<lb />
			as there is a prohibition against waiver of jurisdiction of the DRT by
			<lb />
			necessary implication.
			<lb />
			The legislation has overwritten the
			<lb />
			contractual right to arbitration.

			<lb />
			In Natraj Studios (P) Ltd., a case under the Arbitration Act,1940, it
			<lb />
			was observed that on broader consideration of public policy the
			<lb />
			disputes were non-arbitrable. In N. Radhakrishnan v. Maestro
			<lb />
			Engineers and Others, 33 reliance was placed on the following
			<lb />
			observations in Abdul Kadir Samshuddin Bubere v. Madhav
			<lb />
			Prabharkar Oak and Another: 34
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;There is no doubt that when a serious allegation of
			<lb />
			fraud is laid against the party and the party who
			<lb />
			charged with the fraud desires that the matter should
			<lb />
			be tried in the open court it would be sufficient cause
			<lb />
			for the court for the court not to order an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement to be filed and not to make the reference.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			N. Radhakrishnan upheld the order rejecting the application
			<lb />
			under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act on the ground that it would
			<lb />
			be in furtherance of justice that the allegations as to fraud and
			<lb />
			manipulation of finances in the partnership firm are tried in the
			<lb />

			complicated matter. However, in A. Ayyasamy, notwithstanding
			<lb />
			the allegations of fraud, the civil appeal was allowed, the civil suit
			<lb />
			was stayed and reference to arbitration under Section 8 of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act was made. A.K. Sikri J. held that the Arbitration Act
			<lb />
			does not make any specific provision for excluding any category of
			<lb />
			disputes terming them as non-arbitrable but there are a number of
			<lb />
			pronouncements which hold that fraud is one such category where
			<lb />
			the dispute would be considered as non-arbitrable. Elucidating on
			<lb />
			the exclusion, he observed that pleading of a mere allegation of
			<lb />
			fraud by one party is not enough. The allegation of fraud should be
			<lb />
			such which makes a virtual case of a criminal offence. On the
			<lb />
			question of non-arbitrability when there are allegations of fraud, he

			<lb />
			fraud which make a virtual case of criminal offense or
			<lb />
			where allegations of fraud are so complicated that it
			<lb />
			becomes absolutely essential that such complex
			<lb />
			issues can be decided only by the civil court on the
			<lb />
			appreciation of the voluminous evidence that needs to
			<lb />
			be produced, the court can sidetrack the agreement
			<lb />
			by dismissing the application under Section 8 and
			<lb />
			proceed with the suit on merits. It can be so done also
			<lb />
			in those cases where there are serious allegations of
			<lb />
			forgery/fabrication of documents in support of the plea
			<lb />
			of fraud or where fraud is alleged against the
			<lb />
			arbitration provision itself or is of such a nature that
			<lb />
			permeates the entire contract, including the
			<lb />
			agreement to arbitrate, meaning thereby in those
			<lb />
			cases where fraud goes to the validity of the contract
			<lb />
			itself of the entire contract which contains the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause or the validity of the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause itself...Such categories of non-arbitrable
			<lb />
			subjects are carved out by the courts, keeping in mind
			<lb />
			the principle of common law that certain disputes
			<lb />
			which are of public nature, etc. are not capable of
			<lb />
			adjudication and settlement by arbitration and for

			D.Y. Chandrachud, J. in his concurring judgment unclasped

			the mandatory nature of Section 8 of the Arbitration Act to observe

			arbitration by relying on Russell on Arbitration, Redfer Hunter on

		<item>
			&quot;13. Once an application in due compliance with
			<lb />
			Section 8 of the Arbitration Act is filed, the approach
			<lb />
			of the civil court should be not to see whether the
			<lb />
			court has jurisdiction. It should be to see whether its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction has been ousted. There is a lot of
			<lb />
			difference between the two approaches. Once it is
			<lb />
			brought to the notice of the court that its jurisdiction
			<lb />
			has been taken away in terms of the procedure
			<lb />
			prescribed under a special statute, the civil court
			<lb />
			should first see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction
			<lb />
			in terms or compliance with the procedure under the
			<lb />
			special statute. The general law should yield to the
			<lb />
			special law -generalia specialibus non derogant. In
			<lb />
			such a situation, the approach shall not be to see
			<lb />
			whether there is still jurisdiction in the civil court under
			<lb />
			the general law. Such approaches would only delay
			<lb />
			the resolution of disputes and complicate the
			<lb />
			redressal of grievance and of course unnecessarily
			<lb />
			increase the pendency in the court.&quot;

			<lb />
			D.Y.Chandrachud J. has observed:

		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;53. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,
			<lb />
			should in my view be interpreted so as to bring in line
			<lb />
			the principles underlying its interpretation in a manner
			<lb />
			that is consistent with prevailing approaches in the
			<lb />
			common law world. Jurisprudence in India must
			<lb />
			evolve towards strengthening the institutional efficacy
			<lb />
			of arbitration. Deference to a forum chosen by parties
			<lb />
			as a complete remedy for resolving all their claims is
			<lb />
			but part of that evolution. Minimising the intervention
			<lb />
			of courts is again a recognition of the same principle.&quot;

			<lb />
			Arbitrability as noticed above in essence is a matter of national
			<lb />
			policy. 35 A statute, on the basis of public policy, can expressly or
			<lb />
			by implication restrict or prohibit arbitrability of disputes. To this
			<lb />
			extent there is uniformity and consensus. However, N.
			<lb />
			Radhakrishnan while accepting that the dispute may be arbitrable
			<lb />
			under the applicable mandatory law, holds that the dispute would
			<lb />
			be non-arbitrable on public policy consideration if it relates to
			<lb />
			serious allegations of fraud. The two views in A. Ayyasamy
			<lb />
			exposit the predicament on the role of public policy in deciding the
			<lb />
			question of law of non-arbitrability. Whether a subject matter or a
			<lb />
			dispute should be held as non-arbitrable on public policy is vexed
			<lb />
			and not free from difficulty as reflected in the strong opinions
			<lb />
			expressed in the judgments. Indeed, under the Arbitration Act,
			<lb />
			1940, the case law in view of the statutory discretion under sub-
			<lb />
			section (4) to Sections 20 and 34 clearly supports and accepts the
			<lb />
			role and relevance of public policy. Legal position under the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act as examined under the heading &apos;Who decides non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability&apos;, however, is different.
			<lb />

		<p>

			<lb />
			We begin by examining sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (b) to
			<lb />
			Sub-section (2) to Section 34, which read as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

			&quot;34. Application for setting aside arbitral award. -

			(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court
			<lb />
			only if -
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) ...
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) the Court finds that--
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable
			<lb />
			of settlement by arbitration under the law for the
			<lb />
			time being in fore, or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public
			<lb />
			policy of India.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation 1. --For the avoidance of any doubt, it is
			<lb />
			clarified that an award is in conflict with the public
			<lb />
			policy of India, only if, --
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) the making of the award was induced or
			<lb />
			affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation
			<lb />
			of section 75 or section 81; or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental
			<lb />
			policy of Indian law; or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of
			<lb />
			morality or justice.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation 2. --For the avoidance of doubt, the test
			<lb />
			as to whether there is a contravention with the
			<lb />
			fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a
			<lb />
			review on the merits of the dispute.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Section 34(2)(b) consists of two sub-clauses both accrediting
			<lb />
			the court with the power to set aside an award. Under sub-clause
			<lb />
			(i) an award is liable to be set aside when the subject matter is not
			<lb />
			capable of settlement by arbitration under law for the time being in
			<lb />
			force. Under sub-clause (ii) an award can be set aside if it is in
			<lb />
			conflict with the public policy of India. As per Explanation No. 1, an
			<lb />
			award is in conflict with the public policy of India only if it was
			<lb />
			induced or affected by fraud, corruption, etc. or it is in
			<lb />
			contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law or is in
			<lb />
			conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
			<lb />
			Explanation 2 cautions the courts not to review on the merits of the
			<lb />
			case while examining the question whether an award is in
			<lb />
			contravention with the fundamental policy of law. Therefore,
			<lb />
			conflict with the public policy of India and a subject matter of
			<lb />
			dispute not capable of settlement by arbitration, are two separate
			<lb />
			and independent grounds on which the court can set aside the
			<lb />
			award. Reference to public policy in Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc.
			<lb />
			and in the present matter and non-arbitrability of the subject matter
			<lb />
			is completely different and has nothing in common with the public
			<lb />
			policy of India referred to in sub-clause (ii) of Section 34(2)(b) of
			<lb />
			the Arbitration Act. Public policy in the context of non-arbitrability
			<lb />
			refers to public policy as reflected in the enactment, that is,
			<lb />
			whether the enactment confers exclusive jurisdiction to the
			<lb />
			specified court or the special forum and prohibits recourse to
			<lb />
			arbitration. Public policy in the context of sub-clause(ii) to Section
			<lb />
			34(2)(b) refers to the public policy of the enactment, defining and
			<lb />
			fixing rights and obligations, and application of those rights and
			<lb />
			obligations by the arbitrator. Statutes unfailingly have a public
			<lb />
			purpose or policy which is the basis and purpose behind the
			<lb />
			legislation. Application of mandatory law to the merits of the case
			<lb />
			do not imply that the right to arbitrate is taken away. Mandatory law
			<lb />
			may require a particular substantive rule to be applied, but this
			<lb />
			would not preclude arbitration. Implied non-arbitrability requires
			<lb />
			prohibition against waiver of jurisdiction, which happens when a
			<lb />
			statute gives special rights or obligations and creates or stipulates
			<lb />
			an exclusive forum for adjudication and enforcement. An arbitrator,
			<lb />
			like the court, is equally bound by the public policy behind the
			<lb />
			statute while examining the claim on merits. The public policy in
			<lb />
			case of non-arbitrability would relate to conferment of exclusive
			<lb />
			jurisdiction on the court or the special forum set up by law for
			<lb />
			decision making. Non-arbitrability question cannot be answered by
			<lb />
			examining whether the statute has a public policy objective which
			<lb />
			invariably every statue would have. There is a general presumption
			<lb />
			in favour of arbitrability, which is not excluded simply because the
			<lb />
			dispute is permeated by applicability of mandatory law. Violation of
			<lb />
			public policy by the arbitrator could well result in setting aside the
			<lb />
			award on the ground of failure to follow the fundamental policy of
			<lb />
			law in India, but not on the ground that the subject matter of the
			<lb />
			dispute was non-arbitrable.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			However, the above discussion would not be a complete answer to
			<lb />
			N. Radhakrishnan that if justice demands, then notwithstanding
			<lb />
			the arbitration clause, the dispute would be tried in the open court.
			<lb />
			To accept this reasoning one would have to agree that arbitration is
			<lb />
			a flawed and compromised dispute resolution mechanism that can
			<lb />
			be forgone when public interest or public policy demands the
			<lb />
			dispute should be tried and decided in the court of law. The public
			<lb />
			policy argument proceeds on the foundation and principle that
			<lb />
			arbitration is inferior to court adjudication as: (i) fact finding process
			<lb />
			in arbitration is not equivalent to judicial fact finding, which is far
			<lb />
			more comprehensive and in-depth; (ii) there is limited or lack of
			<lb />
			reasoning in awards; (iii) arbitrators enjoy and exercise extensive
			<lb />
			and unhindered powers and therefore are prone in making
			<lb />
			arbitrary and despotic decisions; (iv) there is no appeal process in
			<lb />
			arbitration which combined with the (iii) above and limited review of
			<lb />
			an arbitral award in post-award court proceedings, arbitration may
			<lb />
			have devastating consequences for the losing party and
			<lb />
			undermines justice; (v) arbitration proceedings are usually private
			<lb />
			and confidential; (vi) arbitrators are unfit to address issues arising
			<lb />
			out of the economic power disparity or social concerns; 36 (vii)
			<lb />
			business and industry, by adopting and compulsorily applying
			<lb />
			arbitration process, leave the vulnerable and weaker sections with
			<lb />
			little or no meaningful choice but to accept arbitration. A few people
			<lb />
			realize and understand the importance of loss of their right to
			<lb />
			access the court of law or public forum, which are impartial, just
			<lb />
			36 (i) to (vi) from Prof. Stavros Brekoulakis -On Arbitrability: Persisting Misconceptions and New
			<lb />
			Area of Concern.
			<lb />
			and fair; 37 and (viii) arbitration is expensive and costly in
			<lb />
			comparison to court adjudication. 38
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			41.
			<lb />
			While it would not be correct to dispel the grounds as mere
			<lb />
			conjectures and baseless, it would be grossly irrational and
			<lb />
			completely wrong to mistrust and treat arbitration as flawed and
			<lb />
			inferior adjudication procedure unfit to deal with the public policy
			<lb />
			aspects of a legislation. Arbitrators, like the courts, are equally
			<lb />
			bound to resolve and decide disputes in accordance with the public
			<lb />
			policy of the law. Possibility of failure to abide by public policy
			<lb />
			consideration in a legislation, which otherwise does not expressly
			<lb />
			or by necessary implication exclude arbitration, cannot form the
			<lb />
			basis to overwrite and nullify the arbitration agreement. This would
			<lb />
			be contrary to and defeat the legislative intent reflected in the
			<lb />
			public policy objective behind the Arbitration Act. Arbitration has
			<lb />
			considerable advantages as it gives freedom to the parties to
			<lb />
			choose an arbitrator of their choice, and it is informal, flexible and
			<lb />
			quick. Simplicity, informality and expedition are hallmarks of
			<lb />
			arbitration.
			<lb />
			Arbitrators are required to be impartial and
			<lb />
			independent, adhere to natural justice, and follow a fair and just
			<lb />
			37 (vii) from the preamble of the text of the bill of 2007 Arbitration Fairness Act as was written by the
			<lb />
			sponsor and submitted to the House for consideration

			<lb />
			procedure. Arbitrators are normally experts in the subject and
			<lb />
			perform their tasks by referring to facts, evidence, and relevant
			<lb />
			case law. Complexity is not sufficient to ward off arbitration. In
			<lb />
			terms of the mandate of Section 89 of the Civil Procedure Code
			<lb />
			and the object and purpose behind the Arbitration Act and the
			<lb />
			mandatory language of Sections 8 and 11, the mutually agreed
			<lb />
			arbitration clauses must be enforced. The language of Sections 8
			<lb />
			and 11 of the Arbitration Act are peremptory in nature. Arbitration
			<lb />
			Act has been enacted to promote arbitration as a transparent, fair,
			<lb />
			and just alternative to court adjudication. Public policy is to
			<lb />
			encourage and strengthen arbitration to resolve and settle
			<lb />
			economic, commercial and civil disputes. Amendments from time
			<lb />
			to time have addressed the issues and corrected the inadequacies
			<lb />
			and flaws in the arbitration procedure. It is for the stakeholders,
			<lb />
			including the arbitrators, to assure that the arbitration is as
			<lb />
			impartial, just, and fair as court adjudication. It is also the duty of
			<lb />
			the courts at the post-award stage to selectively yet effectively
			<lb />
			exercise the limited jurisdiction, within the four corners of Section
			<lb />
			34(2)(b)(ii) read with Explanation 1 and 2 and check any conflict
			<lb />
			with the fundamental policy of the applicable law. We would
			<lb />
			subsequently refer to the &apos;second look&apos; 39 principle which is
			<lb />
			applicable in three specific situations dealing with arbitrability as
			<lb />
			per the mandate of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.

			Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada in TELUS
			<lb />
			Communications Inc. v. Avraham Wellman, 40 while conceding
			<lb />
			that arbitration as a method of dispute resolution was met with
			<lb />
			&quot;overt hostility&quot; for a long time on public policy grounds as it ousts
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of courts, observed that the new legislation, the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act of 1991, marks a departure as it encourages parties
			<lb />
			to adopt arbitration in commercial and other matters. By putting
			<lb />
			party autonomy on a high pedestal, the Act mandates that the
			<lb />
			parties to a valid arbitration agreement must abide by the
			<lb />
			consensual and agreed mode of dispute resolution. The courts
			<lb />
			must show due respect to arbitration agreements particularly in
			<lb />
			commercial settings by staying the court proceedings, unless the
			<lb />
			legislative language is to the contrary. The principle of party
			<lb />
			autonomy goes hand in hand with the principle of limited court
			<lb />
			intervention, this being the fundamental principle underlying
			<lb />
			modern arbitration law. Party autonomy is weaker in non-

			<lb />
			40 (2019) SCC 19 (CanLII)
			<lb />
			negotiated &quot;take it or leave it&quot; contracts and, therefore, the
			<lb />
			legislature can through statutes shield the weakest and vulnerable
			<lb />
			contracting parties like consumers. This is not so in negotiated
			<lb />
			agreements or even in adhesion contracts having an arbitration
			<lb />
			clause in commercial settings. Virtues of commercial and civil
			<lb />
			arbitration have been recognised and accepted and the courts
			<lb />
			even encourage the use of arbitration.

			A recent judgment of this Court in Avitel Post Studioz Limited
			<lb />
			and Others v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited 41 has
			<lb />
			examined the law on invocation of &apos;fraud exception&apos; in great detail
			<lb />
			and holds that N. Radhakrishnan as a precedent has no legs to
			<lb />
			stand on. We respectfully concur with the said view and also the
			<lb />
			observations made in paragraph 14 of the judgment in Avitel Post
			<lb />
			Studioz Limited, which quotes observations in Rashid Raza v.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Sadaf Akhthar 42 :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;4. The principles of law laid down in this appeal make
			<lb />
			a distinction between serious allegations of forgery/
			<lb />
			fabrication in support of the plea of fraud as opposed
			<lb />
			to &quot;simple allegations&quot;. Two working tests laid down in
			<lb />
			para 25 are: (1) does this plea permeate the entire
			<lb />
			contract and above all, the agreement of arbitration,
			<lb />
			rendering it void, or (2) whether the allegations of
			<lb />
			fraud touch upon the internal affairs of the parties
			<lb />
			inter se having no implication in the public domain.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			to observe in Avitel Post Studioz Limited:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;it is clear that serious allegations of fraud arise only if
			<lb />
			either of the two tests laid down are satisfied and not
			<lb />
			otherwise. The first test is satisfied only when it can
			<lb />
			be said that the arbitration clause or agreement itself
			<lb />
			cannot be said to exist in a clear case in which the
			<lb />
			court finds that the party against whom breach is
			<lb />
			alleged cannot be said to have entered into the
			<lb />
			agreement relating to arbitration at all. The second
			<lb />
			test can be said to have been met in cases in which
			<lb />
			allegations are made against the State or its
			<lb />
			instrumentalities of arbitrary, fraudulent, or mala fide
			<lb />
			conduct, thus, necessitating the hearing of the case
			<lb />
			by a writ court in which questions are raised which are
			<lb />
			not predominantly questions arising from the contract
			<lb />
			itself or breach thereof but questions arising in the
			<lb />
			public law domain.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The judgment in Avitel Post Studioz Limited interprets
			<lb />
			Section 17 of the Contract Act to hold that Section 17 would apply
			<lb />
			if the contract itself is obtained by fraud or cheating. Thereby, a
			<lb />
			distinction is made between a contract obtained by fraud, and post-
			<lb />
			contract fraud and cheating. The latter would fall outside Section
			<lb />
			17 of the Contract Act and, therefore, the remedy for damages
			<lb />
			would be available and not the remedy for treating the contract
			<lb />
			itself as void.

			In Deccan Paper Mills Co. Ltd. v. Regency Mahavir

			Properties 43 , legal proceedings for cancellation of documents
			<lb />
			under Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 were held to be
			<lb />

			<lb />
			judgment refers to the definition of action in rem by R.H. Graveson
			<lb />
			(Conflict of Laws 98, 7 th ed. 1974), which reads as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;An action in rem is one in which the judgment of the
			<lb />
			Court determines the title to property and the rights of
			<lb />
			the parties, not merely as between themselves, but

			<lb />
			In view of the above discussion, we would like to propound a four-
			<lb />
			fold test for determining when the subject matter of a dispute in an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement is not arbitrable:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(1) when cause of action and subject matter of the
			<lb />
			dispute relates to actions in rem, that do not pertain to
			<lb />
			subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights
			<lb />
			in rem.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) when cause of action and subject matter of the
			<lb />
			dispute affects third party rights; have erga omnes
			<lb />
			effect; require centralized adjudication, and mutual
			<lb />
			adjudication would not be appropriate and
			<lb />
			enforceable;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) when cause of action and subject matter of the
			<lb />
			dispute relates to inalienable sovereign and public
			<lb />
			interest functions of the State and hence mutual
			<lb />
			adjudication would be unenforceable; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(4) when the subject-matter of the dispute is expressly
			<lb />
			or by necessary implication non-arbitrable as per
			<lb />
			mandatory statute(s).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			These tests are not watertight compartments; they dovetail
			<lb />
			and overlap, albeit when applied holistically and pragmatically will
			<lb />
			help and assist in determining and ascertaining with great degree
			<lb />
			of certainty when as per law in India, a dispute or subject matter is
			<lb />
			non-arbitrable. Only when the answer is affirmative that the
			<lb />
			subject matter of the dispute would be non-arbitrable.
			<lb />
			However, the aforesaid principles have to be applied with
			<lb />
			care and caution as observed in Olympus Superstructures Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd.:

			out of illegal agreements and disputes relating to

			status, such as divorce, which cannot be referred to

			respect of fats relating to a criminal matter, say,
			<lb />
			physical injury, if there is a right to damages for
			<lb />
			personal injury, then such a dispute can be referred to
			<lb />
			arbitration (Keir v. Leeman). Similarly, it has been held
			<lb />
			that a husband and a wife may refer to arbitration the
			<lb />
			terms on which they shall separate, because they can
			<lb />
			make a valid agreement between themselves on that
			<lb />
			matter (Soilleux v. Herbst, Wilson v. Wilson and Cahill
			<lb />
			v. Cahill).&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Applying the above principles to determine non-arbitrability, it is
			<lb />
			apparent that insolvency or intracompany disputes have to be
			<lb />
			addressed by a centralized forum, be the court or a special forum,
			<lb />
			which would be more efficient and has complete jurisdiction to
			<lb />
			efficaciously and fully dispose of the entire matter. They are also
			<lb />
			actions in rem. Similarly, grant and issue of patents and
			<lb />
			registration of trademarks are exclusive matters falling within the
			<lb />
			sovereign or government functions and have erga omnes effect.
			<lb />
			Such grants confer monopoly rights. They are non-arbitrable.
			<lb />
			Criminal cases again are not arbitrable as they relate to sovereign
			<lb />
			functions of the State. Further, violations of criminal law are
			<lb />
			offenses against the State and not just against the victim.
			<lb />
			Matrimonial disputes relating to the dissolution of marriage,
			<lb />
			restitution of conjugal rights etc. are not arbitrable as they fall
			<lb />
			within the ambit of sovereign functions and do not have any
			<lb />
			commercial and economic value. The decisions have erga omnes
			<lb />
			effect. Matters relating to probate, testamentary matter etc. are
			<lb />
			actions in rem and are a declaration to the world at large and
			<lb />
			hence are non-arbitrable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			47.
			<lb />
			In view of the aforesaid discussions, we overrule the ratio in N.
			<lb />
			Radhakrishnan inter alia observing that allegations of fraud can
			<lb />
			be made a subject matter of arbitration when they relate to a civil
			<lb />
			dispute. This is subject to the caveat that fraud, which would vitiate
			<lb />
			and invalidate the arbitration clause, is an aspect relating to non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability. We have also set aside the Full Bench decision of the
			<lb />
			Delhi High Court in the case of HDFC Bank Ltd. which holds that
			<lb />
			the disputes which are to be adjudicated by the DRT under the
			<lb />
			DRT Act are arbitrable. They are non-arbitrable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			48.
			<lb />
			Landlord-tenant disputes governed by the Transfer of Property Act
			<lb />
			are arbitrable as they are not actions in rem but pertain to
			<lb />
			subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in rem. Such
			<lb />
			actions normally would not affect third-party rights or have erga
			<lb />
			omnes affect or require centralized adjudication. An award passed
			<lb />
			deciding landlord-tenant disputes can be executed and enforced
			<lb />
			like a decree of the civil court. Landlord-tenant disputes do not
			<lb />
			relate to inalienable and sovereign functions of the State. The
			<lb />
			provisions of the Transfer of Property Act do not expressly or by
			<lb />
			necessary implication bar arbitration. Transfer of Property Act, like
			<lb />
			all other Acts, has a public purpose, that is, to regulate landlord-
			<lb />
			tenant relationships and the arbitrator would be bound by the
			<lb />
			provisions, including provisions which enure and protect the
			<lb />
			tenants.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			49.
			<lb />
			In view of the aforesaid, we overrule the ratio laid down in
			<lb />
			Himangni Enterprises and hold that landlord-tenant disputes are
			<lb />
			arbitrable as the Transfer of Property Act does not forbid or
			<lb />
			foreclose arbitration. However, landlord-tenant disputes covered
			<lb />
			and governed by rent control legislation would not be arbitrable
			<lb />
			when specific court or forum has been given exclusive jurisdiction
			<lb />
			to apply and decide special rights and obligations. Such rights and
			<lb />
			obligations can only be adjudicated and enforced by the specified
			<lb />
			court/forum, and not through arbitration.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<head>
			Who decides non-arbitrability?
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			50.
			<lb />
			Lord Mustill&apos;s well-known comparison of the relationship between
			<lb />
			courts and arbitrators to a relay race, reads:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Ideally, the handling of arbitrable disputes should
			<lb />
			resemble a relay race. In the initial stages, before the
			<lb />
			arbitrators are seized of the dispute, the baton is in
			<lb />
			the grasp of the court; for at that stage there is no
			<lb />
			other organisation which could take steps to prevent
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement for being ineffectual. When
			<lb />
			the arbitrators take charge they take over the baton
			<lb />
			and retain it until they have made an award. At this
			<lb />
			point, having no longer a function to fill, the arbitrators
			<lb />
			hand back the baton so that the court can in case of
			<lb />
			need lend its coercive powers to the enforcement of
			<lb />
			the award.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Thus, the legal problem of allocation of decision-making
			<lb />
			authority between courts and arbitral tribunals.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51.
			<lb />
			Issue of non-arbitrability can be raised at three stages. First,
			<lb />
			before the court on an application for reference under Section 11
			<lb />
			or for stay of pending judicial proceedings and reference under
			<lb />
			Section 8 of the Arbitration Act; secondly, before the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal during the course of the arbitration proceedings; or thirdly,
			<lb />
			before the court at the stage of the challenge to the award or its
			<lb />
			enforcement. Therefore, the question -&apos;Who decides non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability?&apos; and, in particular, the jurisdiction of the court at the
			<lb />
			first look stage, that is, the referral stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			52.
			<lb />
			Who decides the question of non-arbitrability? -a jurisdictional
			<lb />
			question is a technical legal issue, and requires clarity when
			<lb />
			applied to facts to avoid bootstrapping and confusion. The doubt
			<lb />
			as to who has the jurisdiction to decide could hinder, stray, and
			<lb />
			delay a many arbitration proceedings. Unfortunately, who decides
			<lb />
			non-arbitrability remains a vexed question that does not have a
			<lb />
			straightforward universal answer as would be apparent from
			<lb />
			opinions in the at-variance Indian case laws on this subject. To
			<lb />
			some extent, the answer depends on how much jurisdiction the
			<lb />
			enactment gives to the arbitrator to decide their own jurisdiction as
			<lb />
			well as the court&apos;s jurisdiction at the reference stage and in the
			<lb />
			post-award proceedings. It also depends upon the jurisdiction
			<lb />
			bestowed by the enactment, viz. the facet of non-arbitrability in
			<lb />
			question, the scope of the arbitration agreement and authority
			<lb />
			conferred on the arbitrator.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			53.
			<lb />
			Under the Arbitration Act, 1940, the jurisdiction to settle and decide
			<lb />
			non-arbitrability issues relating to existence, validity, scope as well
			<lb />
			as whether the subject matter was capable of arbitration, with
			<lb />
			possible exception in case of termination, novation, frustration and
			<lb />
			&apos;accord and satisfaction&apos; when contested on facts, was determined
			<lb />
			and decided at the first or at the reference stage by the courts.
			<lb />
			The principle being that the court should be satisfied about the
			<lb />
			existence of a valid arbitration agreement and that the disputes
			<lb />
			have arisen with regard to the subject matter of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. At this stage, the court would be, however, not
			<lb />
			concerned with the merits or sustainability of the disputes. Despite
			<lb />
			best efforts to contain obstructive tactics, adjudication and final
			<lb />
			decision of non-arbitrability issues at the reference stage would
			<lb />
			invariably stop, derail and thwart the proceedings in the courts for
			<lb />
			years.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			54.
			<lb />
			The Arbitration Act based upon the UNCITRAL Model Law
			<lb />
			introduced an entirely new regimen with the objective to promote
			<lb />
			arbitration in commercial and economic matters as an alternative
			<lb />
			dispute resolution mechanism that is fair, responsive and efficient
			<lb />
			to contemporary requirements. One of the primary objectives of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act is to reduce and minimize the supervisory role of
			<lb />
			courts. Accordingly, the statutory powers of the arbitral tribunal to
			<lb />
			deal with and decide jurisdictional issues of non-arbitrability were
			<lb />
			amplified and the principles of separation and competence-
			<lb />
			competence were incorporated, while the courts retained some
			<lb />
			power to have a &apos;second look&apos; in the post-award challenge
			<lb />
			proceeding. On the jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage,
			<lb />
			views of this Court have differed and there have been statutory
			<lb />
			amendments to modify and obliterate the legal effect of the court
			<lb />
			decisions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			55.
			<lb />
			The legal position as to who decides the question of non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability under the Arbitration Act can be divided into four
			<lb />
			phases. The first phase was from the enforcement of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act till the decision of the Constitution Bench of seven
			<lb />
			Judges in Patel Engineering Ltd. on 26 th October 2005. For
			<lb />
			nearly ten years, the ratio expressed in Konkan Railway Corpn.
			<lb />
			Ltd. and Others v. Mehul Construction Co., 44 affirmed by the
			<lb />
			Constitution Bench of five Judges in Konkan Railway
			<lb />
			Construction Ltd. and Another v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd., 45
			<lb />
			had prevailed. The second phase commenced with the decision in
			<lb />
			Patel Engineering Ltd. till the legislative amendments, which
			<lb />
			were made to substantially reduce court interference and overrule
			<lb />
			the legal effect of Patel Engineering Ltd. vide Act 3 of 2016 with
			<lb />
			retrospective effect from 23 rd October 2015. The third phase
			<lb />
			commenced with effect from 23 rd October 2015 and continued till
			<lb />
			the enactment of Act 33 of 2019 with effect from 9 th August 2019,
			<lb />
			from where commenced the fourth phase, with a clear intent to
			<lb />
			promote institutionalized arbitration rather than ad hoc arbitration.
			<lb />
			The amendments introduced by Act 33 of 2019 have been partially
			<lb />
			implemented and enforced. In the present case, we are primarily
			<lb />
			concerned with the legal position in the third phase with effect from
			<lb />
			23 rd October 2015 when amendments by Act 3 of 2016 became
			<lb />
			operative.

			Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 43 of the Arbitration

			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;43. Limitations. -(1) The Limitation Act, 1963 (36
			<lb />

			<lb />
			In, Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd. the Constitution Bench reiterated
			<lb />
			the earlier view expressed in Mehul Construction Co., that an
			<lb />
			order appointing an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration
			<lb />
			Act is an administrative order that did not mandate notice and
			<lb />
			hearing of the other party. Being an administrative order, the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice or his nominee do not decide any preliminary issue, or the
			<lb />
			issue of non-arbitrability, validity and existence of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement, which are to be decided by the arbitrator at the first
			<lb />
			instance.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			58.
			<lb />
			However, a Constitution Bench of seven Judges vide majority
			<lb />
			judgment in Patel Engineering Ltd. overruled this ratio and held:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;38… But the basic requirement for exercising his
			<lb />
			power under Section 11(6), is the existence of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement in terms of Section 7 of the Act
			<lb />
			and the applicant before the Chief Justice being
			<lb />
			shown to be a party to such an agreement. It would
			<lb />
			also include the question of the existence of
			<lb />
			jurisdiction in him to entertain the request and an
			<lb />
			enquiry whether at least a part of the cause of action
			<lb />
			has arisen within the State concerned. Therefore, a
			<lb />
			decision on jurisdiction and on the existence of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement and of the person making the
			<lb />
			request being a party to that agreement and the
			<lb />
			subsistence of an arbitrable dispute require to be
			<lb />
			decided and the decision on these aspects is a
			<lb />
			prelude to the Chief Justice considering whether the
			<lb />
			requirements of sub-section (4), sub-section (5) or
			<lb />
			sub-section (6) of Section 11 are satisfied when
			<lb />
			approached with the request for appointment of an
			<lb />
			arbitrator......
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			39. It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, approached with an application under Section
			<lb />
			11 of the Act, is to decide at that stage. Obviously, he
			<lb />
			has to decide his own jurisdiction in the sense
			<lb />
			whether the party making the motion has approached
			<lb />
			the right High Court. He has to decide whether there
			<lb />
			is an arbitration agreement, as defined in the Act and
			<lb />
			whether the person who has made the request before
			<lb />
			him, is a party to such an agreement. It is necessary
			<lb />
			to indicate that he can also decide the question
			<lb />
			whether the claim was a dead one; or a long-barred
			<lb />
			claim that was sought to be resurrected and whether
			<lb />
			the parties have concluded the transaction by
			<lb />
			recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and
			<lb />
			obligations or by receiving the final payment without
			<lb />
			objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to
			<lb />
			decide whether a live claim made, is one which
			<lb />
			comes within the purview of the arbitration clause. It
			<lb />
			will be appropriate to leave that question to be
			<lb />
			decided by the Arbitral Tribunal on taking evidence,
			<lb />
			along with the merits of the claims involved in the
			<lb />
			arbitration. The Chief Justice has to decide whether
			<lb />
			the applicant has satisfied the conditions for
			<lb />
			appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the
			<lb />
			Act. For the purpose of taking a decision on these
			<lb />
			aspects, the Chief Justice can either proceed on the
			<lb />
			basis of affidavits and the documents produced or
			<lb />
			take such evidence or get such evidence recorded, as
			<lb />
			may be necessary. We think that adoption of this
			<lb />
			procedure in the context of the Act would best serve
			<lb />
			the purpose sought to be achieved by the Act of
			<lb />
			expediting the process of arbitration, without too many
			<lb />
			approaches to the court at various stages of the
			<lb />
			proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			In Patel Engineering Ltd., the Court also held that Section
			<lb />
			16 of the Arbitration Act makes explicit, what is otherwise implicit,
			<lb />
			that the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on its own
			<lb />
			jurisdiction, including ruling on objections to existence or validity of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement, but this provision would apply when the
			<lb />
			parties have gone to the arbitral tribunal without recourse to
			<lb />
			Sections 8 or 11 of the Arbitration Act and not when the court at
			<lb />
			the reference stage has decided the jurisdictional issues. Decision
			<lb />
			of the court at the referral stage would be final and binding on the
			<lb />
			arbitral tribunal. Majority judgment also clarified that when an
			<lb />
			arbitral tribunal has been constituted by the parties without having
			<lb />
			taken recourse to a court order, the arbitral tribunal will have
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to decide all matters contemplated by Section 16 of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act.

			<lb />
			In National Insurance Company Limited v. Boghara Polyfab
			<lb />
			Private Limited, 46 a two Judges&apos; Bench of this Court, elucidating
			<lb />
			on Patel Engineering Ltd., had identified and segregated the
			<lb />
			issues that arise for consideration in an application under Section
			<lb />
			11 of the Arbitration Act into three categories, viz. (i) issues which
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice or his designate is bound to decide; (ii) issues
			<lb />
			which he can also decide, that is, issues which he may choose to
			<lb />
			decide or leave it to the arbitral tribunal to decide; and (iii) issues
			<lb />
			which should be left to the arbitral tribunal to decide, and thereafter
			<lb />
			had enumerated them as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;22.1 The issues (first category) which the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice/his designate will have to decide are:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) Whether the party making the application has
			<lb />
			approached the appropriate High Court.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) Whether there is an arbitration agreement and
			<lb />
			whether the party who has applied under Section
			<lb />
			11 of the Act, is a party to such an agreement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			22.2 The issues (second category) which the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice/his designate may choose to decide (or leave
			<lb />
			them to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal) are:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) Whether the claim is a dead (long-barred)
			<lb />
			claim or a live claim.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) Whether the parties have concluded the
			<lb />
			contract/transaction by recording satisfaction of
			<lb />
			their mutual rights and obligation or by receiving
			<lb />
			the final payment without objection.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			22.3 The issues (third category) which the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice/his designate should leave exclusively to the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal are:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) Whether a claim made falls within the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause (as for example, a matter which
			<lb />
			is reserved for final decision of a departmental
			<lb />
			authority and excepted or excluded from
			<lb />
			arbitration).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Merits or any claim involved in the arbitration.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			23. It is clear from the scheme of the Act as explained
			<lb />
			by this Court in SBP &amp; Co., that in regard to issues
			<lb />
			falling under the second category, if raised in any
			<lb />
			application under Section 11 of the Act, the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice/his designate may decide them, if necessary,
			<lb />
			by taking evidence. Alternatively, he may leave those
			<lb />
			issues open with a direction to the Arbitral Tribunal to
			<lb />
			decide the same. If the Chief Justice or his designate
			<lb />
			chooses to examine the issue and decides it, the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal cannot re-examine the same issue.
			<lb />
			The Chief Justice/his designate will, in choosing
			<lb />
			whether he will decide such issue or leave it to the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal, be guided by the object of the Act
			<lb />
			(that is expediting the arbitration process with
			<lb />
			minimum judicial intervention). Where allegations of
			<lb />
			forgery/fabrication are made in regard to the
			<lb />
			document recording discharge of contract by full and
			<lb />
			final settlement, it would be appropriate if the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice/his designate decides the issue.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			24. What is however clear is when a respondent
			<lb />
			contends that the dispute is not arbitrable on account
			<lb />
			of discharge of the contract under a settlement
			<lb />
			agreement or discharge voucher or no-claim
			<lb />
			certificate, and the claimant contends that it was
			<lb />
			obtained by fraud, coercion or undue influence, the
			<lb />
			issue will have to be decided either by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice/his designate in the proceedings under
			<lb />
			Section 11 of the Act or by the Arbitral Tribunal as
			<lb />
			directed by the order under Section 11 of the Act. A
			<lb />
			claim for arbitration cannot be rejected merely or
			<lb />
			solely on the ground that a settlement agreement or
			<lb />
			discharge voucher had been executed by the
			<lb />
			claimant, if its validity is disputed by the claimant.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			60.
			<lb />
			The issues included in the first category were: whether the party
			<lb />
			making the application had approached the appropriate High
			<lb />
			Court, that is, the jurisdictional High Court; whether there is an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement and whether the person who had applied
			<lb />
			under Section 11 is a party to such agreement. This would include
			<lb />
			the question whether the defendant or the opposite party is a party
			<lb />
			to the arbitration agreement or bound by the arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			in terms of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act. With respect to the
			<lb />
			second category, the Court observed that the Chief Justice or his
			<lb />
			designate may decide the issue, if necessary, by taking evidence
			<lb />
			or in the alternative may leave the issues open with the direction to
			<lb />
			the arbitral tribunal to decide the same. Where the Chief Justice or
			<lb />
			his designate examines the issue and decides it, the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal cannot re-examine the issue. The Chief Justice or his
			<lb />
			designate would exercise this choice being guided by the object of
			<lb />
			the Arbitration Act, that is, expediting the arbitration process with
			<lb />
			minimum judicial intervention. Where dispute arises on account of
			<lb />
			settlement agreement, discharge voucher, no claim certificate
			<lb />
			amounting to discharge or accord and satisfaction, and the other
			<lb />
			side contends that such certificates were obtained by fraud,
			<lb />
			coercion or undue influence, the issue will have to be decided
			<lb />
			either by the Chief Justice or his designate in proceedings under
			<lb />
			Section 11 or by the arbitral tribunal as directed by the order under
			<lb />
			Section 11 of the Act. A claim for arbitration cannot be rejected
			<lb />
			merely or solely on the ground that the settlement agreement or
			<lb />
			discharge voucher had been executed if its validity is disputed. The
			<lb />
			third category would cover all other questions within the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause, which the court believed are within the exclusive
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal at the first stage. This was
			<lb />
			explained by giving an example of a matter purportedly reserved
			<lb />
			for the final determination of the departmental authority or
			<lb />
			excepted or excluded matters. It would also include merits of any
			<lb />
			claim involved in arbitration.

			<lb />
			Paragraph 22 of Boghara Polyfab Private Limited, if read
			<lb />
			carefully, states that the factors to be considered while deciding an
			<lb />
			application under Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act would
			<lb />
			require an examination of whether there exists an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement, that is, the agreement provides for arbitration
			<lb />
			proceedings in respect of disputes which have arisen between the
			<lb />
			parties to the agreement. The latter portion requires the court to
			<lb />
			apply its mind whether the disputes which have arisen can be
			<lb />
			settled by the arbitration agreement. The aforesaid observations,
			<lb />
			in our opinion, would be in conformity with the majority decision of
			<lb />
			the Constitution Bench in Patel Engineering Ltd. wherein it was
			<lb />
			observed that Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act are
			<lb />
			complimentary in nature and the Court, while exercising powers
			<lb />
			under the two Sections on whether the matter should be referred to
			<lb />
			arbitration, enjoys equal powers, otherwise, it would lead to an
			<lb />
			anomalous situation in that a judicial authority has wider power
			<lb />
			under Section 8 but lesser power of examination under Section 11.

		<p>
			62.
			<lb />
			In Arasmeta Captive Power Company Private Limited and
			<lb />
			Another v. Lafarge India Private Limited, 47 this Court had
			<lb />
			examined whether there is any conflict between Patel
			<lb />
			Engineering Ltd. and Boghara Polyfab Private Limited on the
			<lb />
			question of the scope of inquiry while deciding an application under
			<lb />
			Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act. The Division Bench in
			<lb />
			Arasmeta Captive Power Co. Pvt. Ltd. had referred to paragraph
			<lb />
			39 and sub-para (iv) of paragraph 47 in Patel Engineering Ltd., to
			<lb />
			observe:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;18. On a careful reading of para 39 and Conclusion
			<lb />
			(iv), as set out in para 47 of SBP case [SBP &amp;
			<lb />
			Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] , it is
			<lb />
			limpid that for the purpose of setting into motion the
			<lb />
			arbitral procedure the Chief Justice or his designate is
			<lb />
			required to decide the issues, namely, (i) territorial
			<lb />
			jurisdiction, (ii) existence of an arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			between the parties, (iii) existence or otherwise of a
			<lb />
			live claim, and (iv) existence of the conditions for
			<lb />
			exercise of power and further satisfaction as regards
			<lb />
			the qualification of the arbitrator. That apart, under
			<lb />
			certain circumstances the Chief Justice or his
			<lb />
			designate is also required to see whether a long-
			<lb />
			barred claim is sought to be restricted and whether
			<lb />
			the parties had concluded the transaction by
			<lb />
			recording satisfaction of the mutual rights and
			<lb />
			obligations or by receiving the final payment without
			<lb />
			objection.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Thereafter, reference was made to the opinion expressed in
			<lb />
			judgment in Shree Ram Mills Ltd. v. Utility Premises (P) Ltd., 48
			<lb />
			which it was contented had taken a different view from one in
			<lb />
			Boghara Polyfab Private Limited. Disagreeing, the Court
			<lb />
			referred to the three Judge Bench decision in Chloro Controls
			<lb />
			India Private Limited which had considered the issue whether
			<lb />
			there was any variance between Shree Ram Mills Ltd. and
			<lb />
			Boghara Polyfab Private Limited, to hold that there was none
			<lb />
			and both the judgments are capable of being read in harmony to
			<lb />
			bring in line with the law declared in Patel Engineering Ltd. In
			<lb />
			particular, a reference was made to the following portion of the
			<lb />
			paragraph 27 of Shree Ram Mills Ltd. and paragraph 119 of
			<lb />
			Chloro Controls India Private Limited which read as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;27. … If the Chief Justice does not, in the strict
			<lb />
			sense, decide the issue, in that event it is for him to
			<lb />
			locate such issue and record his satisfaction that such
			<lb />
			issue exists between the parties. It is only in that
			<lb />
			sense that the finding on a live issue is given. Even at
			<lb />
			the cost of repetition we must state that it is only for
			<lb />
			the purpose of finding out whether the arbitral
			<lb />
			procedure has to be started that the Chief Justice has
			<lb />
			to record satisfaction that there remains a live issue in
			<lb />
			between the parties. The same thing is about the
			<lb />
			limitation which is always a mixed question of law and
			<lb />
			fact. The Chief Justice only has to record his
			<lb />
			satisfaction that prima facie the issue has not become
			<lb />
			dead by the lapse of time or that any party to the
			<lb />
			agreement has not slept over its rights beyond the
			<lb />
			time permitted by law to agitate those issues covered
			<lb />
			by the agreement. It is for this reason that it was
			<lb />
			pointed out in the above paragraph that it would be
			<lb />
			appropriate sometimes to leave the question
			<lb />
			regarding the live claim to be decided by the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal. All that he has to do is to record his
			<lb />
			satisfaction that the parties have not closed their
			<lb />
			rights and the matter has not been barred by
			<lb />
			limitation. Thus, where the Chief Justice comes to a
			<lb />
			finding that there exists a live issue, then naturally this
			<lb />
			finding would include a finding that the respective
			<lb />
			claims of the parties have not become barred by
			<lb />
			limitation.&quot;

		<item>
			&quot;119. Thus, the Bench while explaining the judgment
			<lb />
			of this Court in SBP [SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2005) 8 SCC 618] has stated that the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			may not decide certain issues finally and upon
			<lb />
			recording satisfaction that prima facie the issue has
			<lb />
			not become dead even leave it for the Arbitral Tribunal
			<lb />
			to decide.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			In Arasmeta Captive Power Co. (P) Ltd., elucidating on the
			<lb />
			question whether the dispute was arbitrable within the scope of the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause should be decided by the Chief Justice/designate
			<lb />
			Judge or by the arbitrator, this Court has observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;... The stress laid thereon may be innovative but
			<lb />
			when the learned Judges themselves have culled out
			<lb />
			the ratio decidendi in para 39, it is extremely difficult
			<lb />
			to state that the principle stated in SBP [SBP &amp;
			<lb />
			Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] requires
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice or his designate to decide the
			<lb />
			controversy when raised pertaining to arbitrability of
			<lb />
			the disputes. Or to express an opinion on excepted
			<lb />
			matters. Such an inference by syllogistic process is
			<lb />
			likely to usher in catastrophe in jurisprudence
			<lb />
			developed in this field. We are disposed to think so as
			<lb />
			it is not apposite to pick up a line from here and there
			<lb />
			from the judgment or to choose one observation from
			<lb />
			here or there for raising it to the status of &quot;the ratio
			<lb />
			decidendi&quot;. That is most likely to pave one on the path
			<lb />
			of danger and it is to be scrupulously avoided. The
			<lb />
			propositions set out in SBP, in our opinion, have been
			<lb />
			correctly understood by the two-Judge Bench
			<lb />
			in Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd. and the same have been
			<lb />
			appositely approved by the three-Judge Bench
			<lb />
			in Chloro Controls India (P) Ltd. and we respectfully
			<lb />
			concur with the same. We find no substance in the
			<lb />
			submission that the said decisions require
			<lb />
			reconsideration, for certain observations made
			<lb />
			in SBP, were not noticed. We may hasten to add that
			<lb />
			the three-Judge Bench has been satisfied that the
			<lb />
			ratio decidendi of the judgment in SBP is really
			<lb />
			inhered in para 39 of the judgment.&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
			B.N. Srikrishna, J. in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh
			<lb />
			Optifibre Ltd. and Another, 49 a case relating to transnational
			<lb />
			arbitration under the New York Convention, had invoked the
			<lb />
			principle of ex visceribus actus for interpretation of the Arbitration
			<lb />
			Act. Sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the Arbitration Act envisages
			<lb />
			that even in a situation where an application to the court has been
			<lb />
			made in a pending proceeding, arbitration proceedings may
			<lb />
			commence and continue and even an award can be made. Section
			<lb />
			16, it was held, incorporates the principles of separation and
			<lb />
			competence-competence thereby clearly indicating that the
			<lb />
			arbitrator can decide his or her own jurisdiction even when the
			<lb />
			validity of the main contract or the arbitration agreement is
			<lb />
			challenged. Section 34 states that the Court can go into three
			<lb />
			different aspects of arbitrability at the post-award stage. Therefore,
			<lb />
			the Arbitration Act itself envisages that the arbitral tribunal should
			<lb />
			rule on the questions of non-arbitrability subject to the second look
			<lb />
			of the court post the award. This helps in expeditious and quick
			<lb />
			disposal of matters before the court at the first stage while
			<lb />
			reserving the court&apos;s power to examine the three facets of
			<lb />
			arbitrability at the third stage. This also prevents the possibility of
			<lb />
			a multiplicity of trials, an aspect highlighted in Sukanya Holdings
			<lb />
			(P) Ltd. On the ambit of the Court&apos;s jurisdiction at the reference
			<lb />
			stage, it was observed that the correct approach to the review of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement would be restricted to prima facie finding
			<lb />
			that there exists an arbitration agreement that is not null and void,
			<lb />
			inoperative or incapable of being performed. The key rationale for
			<lb />
			holding that the courts&apos; review of the arbitration agreement should
			<lb />
			be limited to a prima facie standard is the principle of competence-
			<lb />
			competence. Further, were the courts are to be empowered to
			<lb />
			fully scrutinize the arbitration agreement an arbitral proceeding
			<lb />
			would have to be stayed until such time that the court seized of the
			<lb />
			matter renders a decision on the arbitration agreement. If the
			<lb />
			finding of the courts would be a final and determinative conclusion,
			<lb />
			then it is obvious that, until such a pronouncement is made, the
			<lb />
			arbitral proceedings would have to hang in abeyance. This
			<lb />
			evidently would defeat the credo and ethos of the Arbitration Act,
			<lb />
			which is to enable expeditious arbitration without avoidable
			<lb />
			intervention by the judicial authorities. As a result, the approach to
			<lb />
			be adopted at the reference stage is whether it is &apos;plainly arguable&apos;
			<lb />
			that the arbitration agreement is in existence. The judgment laid
			<lb />
			emphasis on the fact that the rule of priority in favour of the
			<lb />
			arbitrators is counter-balanced by the courts&apos; power to review the
			<lb />
			existence and validity of the arbitration agreement at the end of the
			<lb />
			arbitral process. It was elucidated:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Even if the court takes the view that the arbitral
			<lb />
			agreement is not vitiated or that it is not invalid,
			<lb />
			inoperative or unenforceable, based upon purely a
			<lb />
			prima facie view, nothing prevents the arbitrator from
			<lb />
			trying the issue fully and rendering a final decision
			<lb />
			thereupon … Even after the court takes a prima facie
			<lb />
			view that the arbitration agreement is not vitiated on
			<lb />
			account of factors enumerated in Section 45, and the
			<lb />
			arbitrator upon a full trial holds that there is no
			<lb />
			vitiating factor in the arbitration agreement and makes
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Section 48(1)(a). The award will be set aside if the
			<lb />
			party against whom it is invoked satisfies the court
			<lb />
			inter alia that the agreement was not valid under the
			<lb />
			law to which the parties had subjected it or under the
			<lb />
			law of the country where the award was made. The
			<lb />
			two basic requirements, namely, expedition at the pre-
			<lb />
			reference stage, and a fair opportunity to contest the
			<lb />
			award after full trial, would be fully satisfied by the
			<lb />
			interpreting Section 45 as enabling the court to act on
			<lb />
			a prima facie view.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			[T]he object of the Act would be defeated if the
			<lb />
			proceedings remain pending in the court even after
			<lb />
			commencing of the arbitration. It is precisely for this
			<lb />
			reason that I am inclined to the view that at the pre-
			<lb />
			reference stage contemplated by Section 45, the
			<lb />
			court is required to take only a prima facie view for
			<lb />
			making the reference, leaving the parties to a full trial

			either before the Arbitral Tribunal or before the court

			at the post-award stage.&quot;

		<p>
			D.M. Dharmadhikari, J. in his partly concurring opinion

			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;112. Whether such a decision of the judicial authority
			<lb />
			or the court, of refusal to make a reference on
			<lb />
			grounds permissible under Section 45 of the Act
			<lb />
			would be subjected to further re-examination before
			<lb />
			the Arbitral Tribunal or the court in which eventually
			<lb />
			the award comes up for enforcement in accordance
			<lb />
			with Section 48(1)(a) of the Act, is a legal question of
			<lb />
			sufficient complexity and in my considered opinion
			<lb />
			since that question does not directly arise on the facts
			<lb />
			of the present case, it should be left open for
			<lb />
			consideration in an appropriate case where such a
			<lb />
			question is directly raised and decided by the court.&quot;

			While Y.K.Sabharwal, J. (as His Lordship then was) dissented.

			We would now refer to decisions of this court post enforcement of

			Act 3 of 2016 with effect from 23 rd October,2015. Reference Order
			<lb />
			observes that &quot;one moot question that therefore arises, and which
			<lb />
			needs to be authoritatively decided by a Bench of three learned
			<lb />
			Judges, is whether the word &apos;existence&apos; would include weeding-out
			<lb />
			arbitration clauses in agreements which indicate that the subject

			matter is incapable of arbitration&quot;. Thereafter paragraph 59 from

			In Mayavati Trading Private Limited v. Pradyuat Deb Burman, 50
			<lb />
			a three Judge Bench has held that the legislature by inserting sub-
			<lb />
			section (6-A) to Section 11 and making amendments to Section 8
			<lb />
			by Act 3 of 2016 has legislatively introduced a new regime so as to
			<lb />
			dilute and legislatively overrule the effect and ratio of the judgment
			<lb />
			of this Court in Patel Engineering Ltd. Reliance was placed on
			<lb />
			paragraph 48 and 59 in Duro Felguera S.A. The concluding
			<lb />
			paragraph in Mayavati Trading Private Limited records:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;10. This being the position, it is clear that the law
			<lb />
			prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been laid down
			<lb />
			by this Court, which would have included going into
			<lb />
			whether accord and satisfaction has taken place, has
			<lb />
			now been legislatively overruled. This being the
			<lb />
			position, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning
			<lb />
			contained in the aforesaid judgment, as Section 11(6-
			<lb />
			A) is confined to the examination of the existence of
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement and is to be understood in
			<lb />
			the narrow sense as has been laid down in the
			<lb />
			judgment in Duro Felguera, SA.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			66.
			<lb />
			Paragraph 48 and paragraph 59 of Duro Felguera, S.A. referred
			<lb />
			to above, read as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;48...From a reading of Section 11(6-A), the intention
			<lb />
			of the legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should
			<lb />
			and need only look into one aspect-the existence of
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement. What are the factors for
			<lb />
			deciding as to whether there is an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement is the next question. The resolution to that
			<lb />
			is simple-it needs to be seen if the agreement
			<lb />
			contains a clause which provides for arbitration
			<lb />
			pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between
			<lb />
			the parties to the agreement.

			59. The scope of the power under Section 11(6) of the
			<lb />
			1996 Act was considerably wide in view of the
			<lb />
			decisions in SBP and Co. and Boghara Polyfab . This
			<lb />
			position continued till the amendment brought about
			<lb />
			in 2015. After the amendment, all that the courts need
			<lb />
			to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists-
			<lb />
			nothing more, nothing less. The legislative policy and
			<lb />
			purpose is essentially to minimise the Court&apos;s
			<lb />
			intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator
			<lb />
			and this intention as incorporated in Section 11(6-A)
			<lb />
			ought to be respected.&quot;

			<lb />
			Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. in A. Ayyasamy observed that Section 8
			<lb />
			of the Arbitration Act has made a departure from Article 8 of
			<lb />
			UNCITRAL Model Law as the former uses the expression &apos;judicial
			<lb />
			authority&apos; rather than court and the words &quot;unless it finds that the
			<lb />
			agreement is null and void, inoperative and incapable of being
			<lb />
			performed&quot; mentioned in Article 8 do not find place in Section 8.
			<lb />
			Section 16 empowers the arbitral tribunal to rule upon its own
			<lb />
			jurisdiction, including the ruling with respect to the existence or
			<lb />
			validity of the arbitration agreement. Further clause (b) to Section
			<lb />
			16(1) stipulates that a decision by an arbitral tribunal that the main
			<lb />
			contract is void, will not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause. The arbitration agreement survives for
			<lb />
			determining whether the contract in which the arbitration clause is
			<lb />
			embodied is null and void, which would include voidability. The
			<lb />
			severability doctrine in arbitration is of crucial significance.
			<lb />
			Reference was made to the judgment of the U.K. Court of Appeal
			<lb />
			in Fiona Trust and Holding Corpn. v. Privalov, 51 which judgment
			<lb />
			was affirmed by the House of Lords in Filli Shipping Co. Limited
			<lb />
			v. Premium Nafta Products Ltd., 52 to highlight that the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause should be liberally construed in favour of one-stop
			<lb />
			arbitration. Mere allegation that the agent had no authority to enter
			<lb />
			into the main contract is not necessarily an attack on the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. The principle of severability treats arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement as a distinct agreement that can be void or voidable
			<lb />
			only on the ground that relates to the arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
			Reference was also made to the opinion of Scalia, J. of the
			<lb />
			51 (2007) 1 All ER (Comm) 891 : 2007 Bus LR 686 (CA)
			<lb />
			52 2007 UKHL 40 : 2007 Bus LR 1719 (HL)
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of America in Buckeye Check Cashing Inc. v.
			<lb />
			Cardegna 53 that arbitration agreement is severable from the
			<lb />
			remainder of the contract and unless the challenge is to the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause itself, the issue of contract&apos;s validity should be
			<lb />
			considered by the arbitrator in the first instance. In conclusion, it
			<lb />
			was observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;48. The basic principle which must guide judicial
			<lb />
			decision-making is that arbitration is essentially a
			<lb />
			voluntary assumption of an obligation by contracting
			<lb />
			parties to resolve their disputes through a private
			<lb />
			tribunal. The intent of the parties is expressed in the
			<lb />
			terms of their agreement. Where commercial entities
			<lb />
			and persons of business enter into such dealings,
			<lb />
			they do so with a knowledge of the efficacy of the
			<lb />
			arbitral process. The commercial understanding is
			<lb />
			reflected in the terms of the agreement between the
			<lb />
			parties. The duty of the court is to impart to that
			<lb />
			commercial understanding a sense of business
			<lb />
			efficacy.

			53. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, should
			<lb />
			in my view be interpreted so as to bring in line the
			<lb />
			principles underlying its interpretation in a manner
			<lb />
			that is consistent with prevailing approaches in the
			<lb />
			common law world. Jurisprudence in India must
			<lb />
			evolve towards strengthening the institutional efficacy
			<lb />
			of arbitration. Deference to a forum chosen by parties
			<lb />
			as a complete remedy for resolving all their claims is
			<lb />
			but part of that evolution. Minimising the intervention
			<lb />
			of courts is again a recognition of the same principle.&quot;

			<lb />
			In Garware Wall Ropes Limited v. Coastal Marine
			<lb />
			Constructions and Engineering Limited, 54 the question related
			<lb />
			to the effect of an arbitration clause contained in the master
			<lb />
			contract which was required to be stamped. The second part of
			<lb />
			Section 7(2) was applicable. The issue was whether the judge
			<lb />
			hearing the Section 11 application should impound the main
			<lb />
			contract and ensure that duty and penalty, if any, are paid or in
			<lb />
			view of sub-section (6-A) to Section 11 this issue should be
			<lb />
			examined and decided by the arbitrator. The argument drawing
			<lb />
			distinction between validity and existence was raised before the
			<lb />
			Court (see paragraph 5 which records the contention) but was
			<lb />
			rejected for several reasons, including the reasoning given in Patel
			<lb />
			Engineering Ltd., to hold that it is difficult to accede to the
			<lb />
			argument that Section 16 of the Arbitration Act makes it clear that
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement has an independent existence of its own.
			<lb />
			Secondly, on the connect between existence and validity of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, it was observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;20. Looked at from a slightly different angle, an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement which is contained in an
			<lb />
			agreement or conveyance is dealt with in Section 7(2)
			<lb />
			of the 1996 Act. We are concerned with the first part
			<lb />
			of Section 7(2) on the facts of the present case, and
			<lb />
			therefore, the arbitration clause that is contained in
			<lb />
			the sub-contract in question is the subject-matter of
			<lb />
			the present appeal. It is significant that an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause
			<lb />
			&quot;in a contract&quot;.
			<lb />

			21. Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(g) and 2(h) of the Contract
			<lb />
			Act, 1872 (the Contract Act) read as under:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;2. Interpretation clause.-In this Act the following
			<lb />
			words and expressions are used in the following
			<lb />
			senses, unless a contrary intention appears from
			<lb />
			the context-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) When one person signifies to another his
			<lb />
			willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything,
			<lb />
			with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to
			<lb />
			such act or abstinence, he is said to make a
			<lb />
			proposal;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) When the person to whom the proposal is made
			<lb />
			signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to
			<lb />
			be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes
			<lb />
			a promise;
			<lb />
			xx
			<lb />
			xx
			<lb />
			xx
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(g) An agreement not enforceable by law is said to
			<lb />
			be void;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(h) An agreement enforceable by law is a contract;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			22. When an arbitration clause is contained &quot;in a
			<lb />
			contract&quot;, it is significant that the agreement only
			<lb />
			becomes a contract if it is enforceable by law. We
			<lb />
			have seen how, under the Stamp Act, an agreement
			<lb />
			does not become a contract, namely, that it is not
			<lb />
			enforceable in law, unless it is duly stamped.
			<lb />
			Therefore, even a plain reading of Section 11(6-A),
			<lb />
			when read with Section 7(2) of the 1996 Act and
			<lb />
			Section 2(h) of the Contract Act, would make it clear
			<lb />
			that an arbitration clause in an agreement would not
			<lb />
			exist when it is not enforceable by law. This is also an
			<lb />
			indicator that SMS Tea Estates has, in no manner,
			<lb />
			been touched by the amendment of Section 11(6-A).&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Thereafter, reference was made to paragraph 83 in Enercon
			<lb />
			(India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH 55 wherein the concept of
			<lb />
			separability of arbitration clause or agreement from the underlying
			<lb />
			contract was dealt with, and it was observed that it is necessary to
			<lb />
			ensure that the intention of the parties does not evaporate into thin
			<lb />
			air when there is a challenge to the legality, validity, finality, or
			<lb />
			breach of the underlying contract. This is the mandate of Section
			<lb />
			16 of the Arbitration Act which accepts the concept that the main
			<lb />
			contract and the arbitration agreement form two different contracts.
			<lb />
			It is true that support of the national courts would be required to
			<lb />
			ensure the success of arbitration but this would not detract from
			<lb />
			the legitimacy or independence of the collateral arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement even if it is contained in a contract, which is claimed to
			<lb />
			be void or voidable or un-concluded. However, this judgment was
			<lb />
			distinguished in Garware Wall Ropes Limited as a case relating
			<lb />
			to the controversy whether an arbitration clause was to apply even
			<lb />
			if there is no concluded contract, but the finding was to the
			<lb />
			contrary as the case was within the second part and not under the
			<lb />
			first part of Section 7(2) of the Arbitration Act. In Enercon (India)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			55 (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59
			<lb />
			Ltd., on facts it was held that the arbitration clause was separate
			<lb />
			from the main contract as the disputes relating to the intellectual
			<lb />
			property right license agreement were arbitrable. Thereafter,
			<lb />
			reference was made to the decision in United India Insurance
			<lb />
			Co. Ltd. v. Hyundai Engg. &amp; Construction Co. Ltd. 56 and it was
			<lb />
			observed that the arbitration clause was identical as in Oriental
			<lb />
			Insurance Company Limited v. Narbheram Power and Steel
			<lb />
			Private Limited 57 with the conditional expression of intent only
			<lb />
			when the liability was unequivocally admitted by the insurer and
			<lb />
			the dispute was related to the quantum to be paid under the policy.
			<lb />
			On the question of &apos;existence&apos; and &apos;validity&apos;, the Bench held:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;29. This judgment in Hyundai Engg. case is
			<lb />
			important in that what was specifically under
			<lb />
			consideration was an arbitration clause which would
			<lb />
			get activated only if an insurer admits or accepts
			<lb />
			liability. Since on facts it was found that the insurer
			<lb />
			repudiated the claim, though an arbitration clause did
			<lb />
			&quot;exist&quot;, so to speak, in the policy, it would not exist in
			<lb />
			law, as was held in that judgment, when one
			<lb />
			important fact is introduced, namely, that the insurer
			<lb />
			has not admitted or accepted liability. Likewise, in the
			<lb />
			facts of the present case, it is clear that the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause that is contained in the sub-contract would not
			<lb />
			&quot;exist&quot; as a matter of law until the sub-contract is duly
			<lb />
			stamped, as has been held by us above. The
			<lb />
			argument that Section 11(6-A) deals with &quot;existence&quot;,
			<lb />
			as opposed to Section 8, Section 16 and Section 45,
			<lb />
			which deal with &quot;validity&quot; of an arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			is answered by this Court&apos;s understanding of the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;existence&quot; in Hyundai Engg. case, as
			<lb />
			followed by us.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>

			<lb />
			In Narbheram Power and Steel Private Limited, a three Judges&apos;
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court had decided the Civil Appeal arising from an
			<lb />
			application under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act in an
			<lb />
			insurance contract. Primarily relying upon the decision of three
			<lb />
			Judges&apos; Bench in Vulcan Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Maharaj Singh
			<lb />
			and Another, 58 it was held that the disputes were not arbitrable as
			<lb />
			in terms of the arbitration clause as the insurer had disputed and
			<lb />
			not accepted the liability. The arbitration clause applies only if
			<lb />
			there is a dispute pertaining to the quantum. This decision, though
			<lb />
			dated 2 nd May 2018, did not refer to Section 11(6-A) of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act and interpret the same. The Civil Appeal had arisen
			<lb />
			from the correspondence exchanged between the insurance
			<lb />
			company and the insured in the years 2013 and 2014. However,
			<lb />
			reference was made to the concurring opinion of Dr. D.Y.
			<lb />
			Chandrachud, J. in A. Ayyasamy, and it was observed that the
			<lb />
			decision was not applicable to the case at hand. The decision in
			<lb />
			Chloro Controls India Private Limited was held to be not
			<lb />
			remotely relevant for deciding the lis in the said case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			70.
			<lb />
			This decision in Narbheram Power and Steel Private Limited
			<lb />
			was followed in Hyundai Engg. &amp; Construction Co. Ltd., wherein
			<lb />
			a similar arbitration clause had come up for consideration.
			<lb />
			However, in this case, reference was made to Section 11(6-A) of
			<lb />
			the Arbitration Act. It is, therefore, clear that on two occasions, in
			<lb />
			Narbheram Power and Steel Private Limited and Hyundai
			<lb />
			Engineering and Construction Company Limited, a three
			<lb />
			Judges&apos; Bench of this Court affirmatively and in clear terms held
			<lb />
			that the question of non-arbitrability relating to the enquiry whether
			<lb />
			the dispute was governed by the arbitration clause, can be
			<lb />
			examined by the courts at the reference stage and may not be left
			<lb />
			unanswered to be examined and decided by the arbitral tribunal.
			<lb />
			These are decisions by a Bench of three Judges and, as noticed
			<lb />
			above, were quoted with affirmation in Garware Wall Ropes
			<lb />
			Limited by a Bench of two Judges.
			<lb />

		<p>

			<lb />
			In M/s. PSA Mumbai Investments PTE. Limited v. The Board of
			<lb />
			Trustees of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Another, 59 a
			<lb />
			division bench of this Court, after referring to in detail the global
			<lb />
			invitation of request for qualification and the request for proposal,
			<lb />
			came to the conclusion that the arbitration clause in the request for
			<lb />
			59 Civil Appeal No. 9352 of 2018 decided on 11 th September 2018.
			<lb />
			qualification documents would not be applicable and govern the
			<lb />
			disputes. Therefore, the respondent was left to pursue its claim
			<lb />
			before an appropriate forum, in accordance with law. The decision
			<lb />
			was made at the first or the referral stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			72.
			<lb />
			At this stage we would like to refer to different views expressed by
			<lb />
			scholars on the subject, which also refer to the legal position in
			<lb />
			different countries. Stavros Brekoulakis in his paper titled On
			<lb />
			Arbitrability: Persisting Misconceptions and New Areas of Concern
			<lb />
			accepts that as per prevailing view in-arbitrability of the subject
			<lb />
			matter of the arbitration agreement renders the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement invalid. However, he argues that in-arbitrability of the
			<lb />
			subject matter is an issue concerning jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal
			<lb />
			rather than the validity of the arbitration agreement. Referring to
			<lb />
			Article V(1)(a) and Article V(2)(a) of the New York Convention, he
			<lb />
			draws a distinction between in-arbitrability and invalidity.
			<lb />
			Arbitration agreements are sui generis contracts with both
			<lb />
			contractual and jurisdictional features. The latter is wider in scope.
			<lb />
			The courts at the referral stage may review only whatever is
			<lb />
			related to the formation of the arbitration agreement as a
			<lb />
			substantive contract, that is, contractual aspects of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement and jurisdictional aspects of the arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			should be left to the arbitral tribunal. In other words, at the stage of
			<lb />
			referral, the courts may review only whatever is related to the
			<lb />
			formation of the arbitration agreement (the contractual aspects of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement) and the issues relating to the
			<lb />
			jurisdictional aspects of the arbitration agreement, which as per the
			<lb />
			author includes the question relating to non-arbitrability of the
			<lb />
			claims, should be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunals. Thus, distinction is drawn between validity in terms of
			<lb />
			substantive and formal validity of an arbitration agreement as
			<lb />
			contractual aspects; and whether a claim is non-arbitrable. The
			<lb />
			latter question would be arbitrable and not for the courts to decide
			<lb />
			at the referral stage. However, on referring to Articles II(1) and II(3)
			<lb />
			of the New York Convention the author did observe that it seems to
			<lb />
			include arbitrability of subject matter within the essential meaning
			<lb />
			of an arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			73.
			<lb />
			Emmanuel Gaillard and Yas Banifatemi in Negative Effect of
			<lb />
			Competence-Competence: The Rule of Priority in Favour of the
			<lb />
			Arbitrators observe that it is the basic requirement that the parties
			<lb />
			to the arbitration agreement should honour their undertaking to
			<lb />
			submit to the arbitration any dispute covered by the agreement.
			<lb />
			This entails the consequence that the courts are prohibited from
			<lb />
			hearing such disputes. On the question of courts&apos; interference at
			<lb />
			the reference stage in terms of Article II(3) of the New York
			<lb />
			Convention, they are of the opinion that there is no indication
			<lb />
			provided as to the standard that should be applied for such
			<lb />
			determination, that is, whether the courts are required to conduct
			<lb />
			in-depth investigation into the merits of the existence and validity of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement and issue a final decision on the
			<lb />
			question, or the court should restrict itself to prima facie verification
			<lb />
			that the arbitration agreement exists and is valid, and reserve its
			<lb />
			full review until the time when there is an action to enforce or set
			<lb />
			aside the arbitral award. The question, in effect, is one of timing
			<lb />
			and to the extent the courts are entitled to review the existence
			<lb />
			and validity of the arbitration agreement. The answer, they
			<lb />
			observe, is found in the notion of competence-competence, one of
			<lb />
			the founding principles of the international arbitration law that
			<lb />
			provides the arbitrators with power to rule on their own jurisdiction
			<lb />
			and embodies the mirroring effect that the court should refrain from
			<lb />
			engaging in examination of the arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction before the
			<lb />
			arbitrators themselves have an opportunity to do so. This, they
			<lb />
			state, by no means suggests that the domestic courts relinquish
			<lb />
			their power to review the existence and validity of an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement which is first left to the arbitrators to rule. The courts
			<lb />
			enjoy the power of scrutiny after the award is rendered. They have
			<lb />
			referred to decisions of the higher courts of Switzerland, 60 England,
			<lb />
			France, Canada and India (Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd.) to
			<lb />
			observe that the court&apos;s review at the first stage is limited to prima
			<lb />
			facie verification of existence and validity of the arbitration clause
			<lb />
			without the question being analysed in detail which the tribunal is
			<lb />
			empowered to decide when necessary. At the reference stage, the
			<lb />
			court shall decline jurisdiction if the summary examination of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement does not allow it to find that the agreement is
			<lb />
			null and void, inoperative and incapable of being performed. The
			<lb />
			Canadian courts, apply the general rule that in any case involving
			<lb />
			an arbitration clause, a challenge to arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction must be
			<lb />
			resolved first by the arbitrator and the court will depart from this
			<lb />
			rule of systematic referral of arbitration only if the challenge to
			<lb />
			arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction is solely based on a question of law.
			<lb />
			Exercise of court&apos;s jurisdiction in the latter case would be justified
			<lb />
			as the court is the forum to which the parties first apply when
			<lb />
			60 Article 5 of the Concordat (domestic law) provides that any dispute concerning rights the parties
			<lb />
			may freely dispose of is capable of resolution by arbitration, unless the subject matter of the dispute
			<lb />
			falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of a state authority by virtue of mandatory law.
			<lb />
			requesting for referral and that the arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction regarding
			<lb />
			his or her jurisdiction can be reviewed by the court. Further, it
			<lb />
			allows the court to decide the legal argument for once and for all
			<lb />
			and avoids duplication of a strictly legal debate. Another condition
			<lb />
			is that the court must be satisfied that the challenge to the
			<lb />
			arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction is not a delaying tactic and that it will not
			<lb />
			unduly impair the conduct of arbitration proceedings. This means
			<lb />
			that the court, when considering one of the exceptions, may allow
			<lb />
			the arbitrator to rule on his or her competence as would be best for
			<lb />
			the arbitration process.

			Referring to the House of Lords decision in Premium Nafta

			Products Ltd., the authors have observed that the decision
			<lb />
			reaffirms the principle of severability of an arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			and the proper approach is to stay the court proceedings in favour
			<lb />
			of arbitration. Lord Hoffmann speaking for the House of Lords in
			<lb />
			Premium Nafta Products Ltd. has observed:

		<item>
			&quot;to determine on the evidence before the court that
			<lb />
			[an arbitration agreement] does exist in which case (if

			the disputes fall within the terms of that agreement) a

			<lb />
			&apos;shall&apos; in section 9(4). It is this mandatory provision

			John J. Barcelo III, in his paper titled &apos;Who Decides the Arbitrator&apos;s
			<lb />
			Jurisdiction? Separability and Competence-Competence in
			<lb />
			Transnational Perspective&apos;, observes that the greater the number
			<lb />
			of issues required to be fully adjudicated at Stage I, the greater is
			<lb />
			the potential for disruption of the arbitration process by an
			<lb />
			obstructing party even in case of a genuine agreement to
			<lb />
			arbitration. An extremely pro-arbitration approach with no or
			<lb />
			minimal judicial scrutiny might send all the questions to the
			<lb />
			arbitrators. At the same time arbitration is no holy grail and not all
			<lb />
			parties resisting arbitration are obstructionists. A party must have
			<lb />
			its say in the court, unless he has agreed to arbitrate. A good legal
			<lb />
			order must decide what weight be given to these competing values
			<lb />
			and how to structure the process to maximize overall value by
			<lb />
			reducing opportunities for obstructionism while preserving
			<lb />
			legitimate claims for reasonably prompt judicial decision. Referring
			<lb />
			to the competence-competence and severability principles the
			<lb />
			author has observed: -
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Competence-competence thus addresses the &quot;who
			<lb />
			decides&quot; question on a broader scale and is more
			<lb />
			central to resolving the policy tension between
			<lb />
			protecting arbitration from obstruction, on one hand,
			<lb />
			and preserving legitimate disputes over arbitrator
			<lb />
			jurisdiction for a prompt court hearing, on the other...
			<lb />
			Whereas separability is universally accepted,
			<lb />
			competence-competence is controversial and has
			<lb />
			spawned a range of different national responses.&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>
			The French approach, as the paper notes, is that if an
			<lb />
			arbitral tribunal is already seized of the matter, the court will refuse
			<lb />
			jurisdiction and leave questions as to existence, validity and scope
			<lb />
			of the arbitration agreement to the arbitrators. However, if the
			<lb />
			arbitral tribunal is not yet seized of the matter, the court will
			<lb />
			undertake a limited scrutiny of the challenge and will retain
			<lb />
			jurisdiction only if the arbitration agreement is manifestly null. The
			<lb />
			German Law of Kompetenz-Kompetenz prior to the new 1998
			<lb />
			German Arbitration Act was relatively unique, or arguably so, as
			<lb />
			some commentaries maintain that when express power to decide
			<lb />
			their jurisdiction is conferred on the arbitrator, then it would exclude
			<lb />
			judicial scrutiny at state 1 and stage 3. However, the 1998
			<lb />
			German Arbitration Act based upon UNCITRAL Model Law, states
			<lb />
			that the court may only decide the arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction if
			<lb />
			requested to do so before the arbitral tribunal is constituted. The
			<lb />
			German Law expostulates preference for the arbitrator to decide
			<lb />
			the jurisdiction in an interim award. Referring to the UNCITRAL
			<lb />
			Model Law, reference is made to the competence-competence as
			<lb />
			spelled in Article 8(1) which directly deals with judicial review at
			<lb />
			Stage I, which is limited to the existence of a valid arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. It postulates that the parties shall be referred to
			<lb />
			arbitration, unless the court finds that the agreement is null and
			<lb />
			void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. This, the author
			<lb />
			feels, could be read as authorizing full judicial determination and
			<lb />
			settlement of arbitration agreement&apos;s existence and validity. Article
			<lb />
			16 (1) embodies the positive competence-competence concept
			<lb />
			and Articles 16(3) and 8(2) enact a partial negative competence-
			<lb />
			competence principle. The latter allows arbitration proceedings to
			<lb />
			go forward despite the court consideration of the arbitrator&apos;s
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. Article 16(3) encourages outcome by expressly
			<lb />
			empowering arbitrators to rule over their jurisdiction as a
			<lb />
			preliminary question. The British Arbitration Act of 1996 based on
			<lb />
			the Model Law requires the court to stay the legal proceedings,
			<lb />
			&apos;unless satisfied&apos; that the arbitration agreement is null and void,
			<lb />
			inoperative or incapable of being performed. &quot;Unless satisfied&quot;, the
			<lb />
			author observes, is closer to &quot;unless it is manifest&quot;, rather than it is
			<lb />
			to the Model Law terminology &quot;unless it finds&quot;. The British Act
			<lb />
			allows the arbitrator to render his/her decision on jurisdiction either
			<lb />
			in the preliminary award or in the final award, but allows the parties
			<lb />
			to insist the arbitrators for preliminary and an early decision as a
			<lb />
			check against wasteful proceedings. The paper also deals with the
			<lb />
			American approach in domestic and international arbitration. In
			<lb />
			domestic law the issues of arbitrability have been divided into
			<lb />
			procedural and substantial objections. Procedural arbitrability
			<lb />
			issues include whether a time limit for bringing a claim has been
			<lb />
			observed or whether a party has waived its right to arbitrate and
			<lb />
			also issues like waiver or estoppel thereby denying a party from
			<lb />
			claiming the right or any pre-condition for invoking arbitration has
			<lb />
			not been made, etc. These issues are &apos;gateway questions&apos; 61 that
			<lb />
			are presumptively for the arbitrator to decide and not for the courts
			<lb />
			to decide, at least at the first stage. The substantive aspects are
			<lb />
			those wherein the court at the first stage would go into prima facie
			<lb />
			examination. Substantive issues pertaining to the validity and
			<lb />
			61 First Options of Chicago v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938 (1995) and Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,

			existence of the arbitration agreement (Legal position in domestic

			law post-Buckeye Check Cashing Inc. is explained below.) He
			<lb />
			observes that the United States Supreme Court has frequently
			<lb />
			been more receptive to international as opposed to domestic
			<lb />
			agreements. An important consideration being that international
			<lb />
			agreements are commercial and involve sophisticated, generally
			<lb />
			well-advised parties and there is a need for uniformity of
			<lb />
			interpretation under the New York Convention.

		<p>
			76.
			<lb />
			The United States Supreme Court in Buckeye Check Cashing
			<lb />
			Inc., relying on earlier decisions in Prima Paint Corpn. v. Flood
			<lb />
			&amp; Conklin Mfg. Co. 62 and Southland Corpn. v. Keating, 63 in
			<lb />
			respect of the domestic American law has clarified the legal
			<lb />
			position as establishing the following propositions:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration
			<lb />
			law, an arbitration provision is severable from the
			<lb />
			remainder of the contract. Second, unless the
			<lb />
			challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of
			<lb />
			the contract&apos;s validity is considered by the arbitrator in
			<lb />
			the first instance...Applying them to this case, we
			<lb />
			conclude that because respondents challenge the
			<lb />
			Agreement, but not specifically its arbitration
			<lb />
			provisions, those provisions are enforceable apart
			<lb />
			from the remainder of the contract. The challenge
			<lb />
			should therefore be considered by an arbitrator, not a
			<lb />
			court.&quot;
			<lb />

		</item>
		<p>
			However, these observations have to be read with caution as
			<lb />
			American law states that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;(a) party aggrieved by the alleged failure... of another
			<lb />
			to arbitrate... (the) court shall hear the parties, and
			<lb />
			upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement
			<lb />
			for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not
			<lb />
			an issue, the court shall make an order directing the
			<lb />
			parties to arbitration....if the making of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement or the failure, neglect or refusal to perform
			<lb />
			the same be in issue, the court shall proceed
			<lb />
			summarily to the trial thereof.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Therefore, in case of issue, if in the trial the court determines
			<lb />
			that arbitration agreement was not made it does not order the
			<lb />
			parties to arbitration. However, this principle does not apply when
			<lb />
			the arbitration clause is contained in a &apos;container contract&apos; by the
			<lb />
			application of &apos;separability&apos; doctrine. In Buckeye Check Cashing
			<lb />
			Inc., the US Supreme Court held that separability doctrine applies
			<lb />
			to both voidable and void &apos;container contract&apos; with an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. Distinction is drawn and different principles apply to
			<lb />
			&apos;container contract&apos; with an arbitration clause, and stand-alone
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. 64 Buckeye Check Cashing Inc. ruled that
			<lb />
			courts must send to arbitrators any &quot;challenge to the validity of the
			<lb />
			contract as a whole,&quot; (the container contract), while courts
			<lb />
			themselves must resolve any challenge directed &quot;specifically to the
			<lb />
			64 Prof. Stephen J. Ware in Arbitration Law&apos;s Separability Doctrine After Buckeye Check Cashing,
			<lb />
			Inc. v. Cardegna
			<lb />
			arbitration clause&quot;. When arbitrators hear any challenge to the
			<lb />
			container contract&apos;s validity, Buckeye Check Cashing Inc.
			<lb />
			cautioned:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The issue of the contract&apos;s validity is different from
			<lb />
			the issue of whether any agreement between the
			<lb />
			alleged obligor and oblige was ever concluded.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			77.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Prof. Alan Scott Rau 65 questions the &quot;abstract distinction between
			<lb />
			&apos;invalidity and nonexistence&quot; as &quot;nothing&quot;. The author while
			<lb />
			supporting the principle of separability rejects the argument that
			<lb />
			formation of a contract is different from enforcement of the contract
			<lb />
			as when the agreement is invalid there is no agreement to
			<lb />
			anything. He observes:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;But how much of an improvement is it, really, to
			<lb />
			sweep away the conceptual distinction between &quot;void
			<lb />
			and voidable&quot; contracts-only to replace it with the
			<lb />
			equally abstract distinct between &quot;invalidity&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;nonexistence&quot;? These are all, as a colleague of mine
			<lb />
			likes to say, nothing but word balloons.

			Ingenious riffs on this metaphysical distinction

			contract
			<lb />
			&quot;invalidity&quot;
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			contract
			<lb />
			&quot;nonexistence&quot; have long been a staple of Continental
			<lb />
			legal learning. It has been well-established for over a
			<lb />
			century in learned treatises on the law of obligations.
			<lb />
			Its tendency to take metaphor for reality, its
			<lb />
			personification of legal concepts, its characterization
			<lb />
			of doctrine in terms of what is &quot;unthinkable&quot; or
			<lb />
			&quot;impossible&quot;...of all of this exemplifies the worst
			<lb />
			excesses of formalism....But like the &quot;void/voidable&quot;
			<lb />
			distinction that it closely resembles...to which indeed it
			<lb />
			may even be identical 50 ...this is not only slippery, but
			<lb />
			serves no instrumental function whatever. Happily,
			<lb />
			some modern scholarship seems now at last to
			<lb />
			appreciate that the whole notion of &quot;nonexistence&quot; is
			<lb />
			not only sterile and purely verbal...but what is worse,
			<lb />
			is completely unnecessary. And particularly when we
			<lb />
			come to the doctrine of &quot;separability,&quot; this is a

			distinction that leads precisely.

			<lb />
			Prof. Stephen J. Ware in Arbitration Law&apos;s Separability Doctrine

			After Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., with reference to the American
			<lb />
			Law projects a different view:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;under the contractual approach to arbitration law, the
			<lb />
			right to litigate (like other rights) would be alienable
			<lb />
			through an enforceable contract but not a contract
			<lb />
			that is unenforceable due to misrepresentation,
			<lb />
			duress, illegality, or any other contract-law defense.
			<lb />
			By contrast, the separability doctrine holds that a
			<lb />
			party alienates its right to litigate when that party
			<lb />
			forms a contract containing an arbitration clause even
			<lb />
			if that contract is unenforceable...The only way to fix
			<lb />
			this problem is to repeal the separability doctrine and
			<lb />
			allow courts to hear defenses to the enforcement of
			<lb />
			the contract containing the arbitration clause. Courts
			<lb />
			should send cases to arbitration only after rejecting
			<lb />
			any such defenses.&quot;

			<lb />
			In order to appreciate the effect of the amendments made by Act 3
			<lb />
			of 2016, it would be appropriate to refer to the Law Commission&apos;s
			<lb />
			246 th Report which had given reasons for amendments to Sections
			<lb />
			8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act, including insertion of sub-section (6-
			<lb />
			A) to Section 11. The said reasons read as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;24. Two further sets of amendments have been
			<lb />
			proposed in this context. First, it is observed that a lot
			<lb />
			of time is spent for appointment of arbitrators at the
			<lb />
			very threshold of arbitration proceedings as
			<lb />
			applications under section 11 are kept pending for
			<lb />
			many years. In this context, the Commission has
			<lb />
			proposed a few amendments. The Commission has
			<lb />
			proposed changing the existing scheme of the power
			<lb />
			of appointment being vested in the &quot;Chief Justice&quot; to
			<lb />
			the &quot;High Court&quot; and the &quot;Supreme Court&quot; and has
			<lb />
			expressly clarified that delegation of the power of
			<lb />
			&quot;appointment&quot; (as opposed to a finding regarding the
			<lb />
			existence/nullity of the arbitration agreement) shall not
			<lb />
			be regarded as a judicial act. This would rationalise
			<lb />
			the law and provide greater incentive for the High
			<lb />
			Court and/or Supreme Court to delegate the power of
			<lb />
			appointment (being a non-judicial act) to specialised,
			<lb />
			external persons or institutions. The Commission has
			<lb />
			further recommended an amendment to section 11(7)
			<lb />
			so that decisions of the High Court (regarding
			<lb />
			existence/nullity of the arbitration agreement) are final
			<lb />
			where an arbitrator has been appointed, and as such
			<lb />
			are non-appealable.
			<lb />
			The Commission further
			<lb />
			proposes the addition of section 11(13) which
			<lb />
			requires the Court to make an endeavour to dispose
			<lb />
			of the matter within sixty days from the service of
			<lb />
			notice on the opposite party.

			31. The Commission is of the view that, in this
			<lb />
			context, the same test regarding scope and nature of
			<lb />
			judicial intervention, as applicable in the context of
			<lb />
			section 11, should also apply to sections 8 and 45 of
			<lb />
			the Act -since the scope and nature of judicial
			<lb />
			intervention should not change upon whether a party
			<lb />
			(intending to defeat the arbitration agreement) refuses
			<lb />
			to appoint an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement, or moves a proceeding before a judicial
			<lb />
			authority in the face of such an arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			32. In relation to the nature of intervention, the
			<lb />
			exposition of the law is to be found in the decision of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in Shin Etsu Chemicals Co. Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Aksh Optifibre, (2005) 7 SCC 234, (in the context of
			<lb />
			section 45 of the Act), where the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			ruled in favour of looking at the issues/controversy
			<lb />
			only prima facie.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			33. It is in this context, the Commission has
			<lb />
			recommended amendments to sections 8 and 11 of
			<lb />
			the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The scope
			<lb />
			of judicial intervention is only restricted to situations
			<lb />
			where the Court/Judicial Authority finds that the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreemend does not exist or is null and
			<lb />
			void. In so far as the nature of intervention is
			<lb />
			concerned, it is recommended that in the event the
			<lb />
			Court/Judicial Authority is prima facie satisfied against
			<lb />
			the argument challenging the arbitration agreement, it
			<lb />
			shall appoint the arbitrator and/or refer the parties to
			<lb />
			arbitration, as the case may be. The amendment
			<lb />
			envisages that the judicial authority shall not refer the
			<lb />
			parties to arbitration only if it finds that there does not
			<lb />
			exist an arbitration agreement or that it is null and
			<lb />
			void. If the judicial authority is of the opinion that
			<lb />
			prima facie the arbitration agreement exists, then it
			<lb />
			shall refer the dispute to arbitration, and leave the
			<lb />
			existence of the arbitration agreement to be finally
			<lb />
			determined by the arbitral tribunal. However, if the
			<lb />
			judicial authority concludes that the agreement does
			<lb />
			not exist, then the conclusion will be final and not
			<lb />
			prima facie. The amendment also envisages that
			<lb />
			there shall be a conclusive determination as to
			<lb />
			whether the arbitration agreement is null and void. In
			<lb />
			the event that the judicial authority refers the dispute
			<lb />
			to arbitration and/or appoints an arbitrator, under
			<lb />
			sections 8 and 11 respectively, such a decision will be
			<lb />
			final and non-appealable. An appeal can be
			<lb />
			maintained under section 37 only in the event of
			<lb />
			refusal to refer parties to arbitration, or refusal to
			<lb />
			appoint an arbitrator.&quot;

			<lb />
			We would now examine the principles of separability and
			<lb />
			competence-competence. Clauses (a) and (b) to sub-section (1) to
			<lb />
			Section 16 enact the principle of separation of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement from the underlying or container contract. Clause (a),
			<lb />
			by legal fiction, gives an independent status to an arbitration
			<lb />
			clause as if it is a standalone agreement, even when it is only a
			<lb />
			clause and an integral part of the underlying or container contract.
			<lb />
			Clause (b) formulates a legal rule that a decision by the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal holding that the main contract is null and void shall not
			<lb />
			ipso jure entail invalidity of the arbitration clause. Successful
			<lb />
			challenge to the existence or invalidity or rescission of the main
			<lb />
			contract does not necessarily embrace an identical finding as to
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement, provided the court is satisfied that the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause had been agreed upon.
			<lb />
			The arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement can be avoided only on the ground which relates
			<lb />
			directly to the arbitration agreement. Notwithstanding the challenge
			<lb />
			to the underlying or container contract, the arbitration clause in the
			<lb />
			underlying or container contract survives for determining the
			<lb />
			disputes. The principle prevents boot-strapping as it is primarily for
			<lb />
			the arbitral tribunal and not for the court to decide issues of
			<lb />
			existence, validity and rescission of the underlying contract.
			<lb />
			Principle of separation authorises an arbitral tribunal to rule and
			<lb />
			decide on the existence, validity or rescission of the underlying
			<lb />
			contract without an earlier adjudication of the questions by the
			<lb />
			referral court.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			82.
			<lb />
			An interesting and relevant exposition, when assertions claiming
			<lb />
			repudiation, rescission or &apos;accord and satisfaction&apos; are made by a
			<lb />
			party opposing reference, is to found in Damodar Valley
			<lb />
			Corporation v. K.K. Kar, 66 which had referred to an earlier
			<lb />
			judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Kishorilal Gupta &amp;
			<lb />
			Bros., 67 to observe:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;11. After a review of the relevant case law, Subba
			<lb />
			Rao, J., as he then was, speaking for the majority
			<lb />
			enunciated the following principles: &quot;(1) An arbitration
			<lb />
			clause is a collateral term of a contract as
			<lb />
			distinguished from its substantive terms; but none the
			<lb />
			less it is an integral part of it; (2) however
			<lb />
			comprehensive the terms of an arbitration clause may
			<lb />
			be, the existence of the contract is a necessary
			<lb />
			condition for its operation; it perishes with the
			<lb />
			contract; (3) the contract may be non est in the sense
			<lb />
			that it never came legally into existence or it was
			<lb />
			void ab initio; (4) though the contract was validly
			<lb />
			executed, the parties may put an end to it as if it had
			<lb />
			never existed and substitute a new contract for it
			<lb />
			solely governing their rights and liabilities thereunder;
			<lb />
			(5) in the former case, if the original contract has no
			<lb />
			legal existence, the arbitration clause also cannot
			<lb />
			operate, for along with the original contract, it is also
			<lb />
			void; in the latter case, as the original contract is
			<lb />
			extinguished by the substituted one, the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause of the original contract perishes with it; and (6)
			<lb />
			between the two falls many categories &quot;of disputes in
			<lb />
			connection with a contract, such as the question of
			<lb />
			repudiation, frustration, breach etc. In those cases it is
			<lb />
			the performance of the contract that has come to an
			<lb />
			end, but the contract is still in existence for certain
			<lb />
			purposes in respect of disputes arising under it or in
			<lb />
			connection with it. As the contract subsists for certain
			<lb />
			purposes, the arbitration clause operates in respect of
			<lb />
			these purposes.&quot; In those cases, as we have stated
			<lb />
			earlier, it is the performance of the contract that has
			<lb />
			come to an end but the contract is still in existence for
			<lb />
			certain purposes in respect of disputes arising under it
			<lb />
			or in connection with it. We think as the contract
			<lb />
			subsists for certain purposes, the arbitration clause
			<lb />
			operates in respect of these purposes.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Reference was also made to the minority judgment of Sarkar,
			<lb />
			J. in Kishorilal Gupta &amp; Bros. to observe that he had only
			<lb />
			disagreed with the majority on the effect of settlement on the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause, as he had held that arbitration clause did survive
			<lb />
			to settle the dispute as to whether there was or was not an &apos;accord
			<lb />
			and satisfaction&apos;. It was further observed that this principle laid
			<lb />
			down by Sarkar, J. that &apos;accord and satisfaction&apos; does not put an
			<lb />
			end to the arbitration clause, was not disagreed to by the majority.
			<lb />
			On the other hand, proposition (6) seems to be laying the weight
			<lb />
			on to the views of Sarkar, J. These decisions were under the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act,1940. The Arbitration Act specifically incorporates
			<lb />
			principles of separation and competence-competence and
			<lb />
			empowers the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			83.
			<lb />
			Principles of competence-competence have positive and negative
			<lb />
			connotations. As a positive implication, the arbitral tribunals are
			<lb />
			declared competent and authorised by law to rule as to their
			<lb />
			jurisdiction and decide non-arbitrability questions. In case of
			<lb />
			expressed negative effect, the statute would govern and should be
			<lb />
			followed. Implied negative effect curtails and constrains
			<lb />
			interference by the court at the referral stage by necessary
			<lb />
			implication in order to allow the arbitral tribunal to rule as to their
			<lb />
			jurisdiction and decide non-arbitrability questions. As per the
			<lb />
			negative effect, courts at the referral stage are not to decide on
			<lb />
			merits, except when permitted by the legislation either expressly or
			<lb />
			by necessary implication, such questions of non-arbitrability. Such
			<lb />
			prioritisation of arbitral tribunal over the courts can be partial and
			<lb />
			limited when the legislation provides for some or restricted scrutiny
			<lb />
			at the &apos;first look&apos; referral stage. We would, therefore, examine the
			<lb />
			principles of competence-competence with reference to the
			<lb />
			legislation, that is, the Arbitration Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			84.
			<lb />
			Section 16(1) of the Arbitration Act accepts and empowers the
			<lb />
			arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction including a ruling on
			<lb />
			the objections, with respect to all aspects of non-arbitrability
			<lb />
			including validity of the arbitration agreement. A party opposing
			<lb />
			arbitration, as per sub-section (2), should raise the objection to
			<lb />
			jurisdiction of the tribunal before the arbitral tribunal, not later than
			<lb />
			the submission of statement of defence. However, participation in
			<lb />
			the appointment procedure or appointing an arbitrator would not
			<lb />
			preclude and prejudice any party from raising an objection to the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. Obviously, the intent is to curtail delay and expedite
			<lb />
			appointment of the arbitral tribunal. The clause also indirectly
			<lb />
			accepts that appointment of an arbitrator is different from the issue
			<lb />
			and question of jurisdiction and non-arbitrability. As per sub-section
			<lb />
			(3), any objection that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope
			<lb />
			of its authority should be raised as soon as the matter arises.
			<lb />
			However, the arbitral tribunal, as per sub-section (4), is
			<lb />
			empowered to admit a plea regarding lack of jurisdiction beyond
			<lb />
			the periods specified in sub-section (2) and (3) if it considers that
			<lb />
			the delay is justified. As per the mandate of sub-section (5) when
			<lb />
			objections to the jurisdiction under sub-sections (2) and (3) are
			<lb />
			rejected, the arbitral tribunal can continue with the proceedings
			<lb />
			and pass the arbitration award. A party aggrieved is at liberty to file
			<lb />
			an application for setting aside such arbitral award under Section
			<lb />
			34 of the Arbitration Act. Sub-section (3) to Section 8 in specific
			<lb />
			terms permits an arbitral tribunal to continue with the arbitration
			<lb />
			proceeding and make an award, even when an application under
			<lb />
			sub-section (1) to Section 8 is pending consideration of the
			<lb />
			court/forum. Therefore, pendency of the judicial proceedings even
			<lb />
			before the court is not by itself a bar for the arbitral tribunal to
			<lb />
			proceed and make an award. Whether the court should stay
			<lb />
			arbitral proceedings or appropriate deference by the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal are distinctly different aspects and not for us to elaborate
			<lb />
			in the present reference.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			85.
			<lb />
			Section 34 of the Act is applicable at the third stage post the award
			<lb />
			when an application is filed for setting aside the award. Under
			<lb />
			Section 34, an award can be set aside -(i) if the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement is not valid as per law to which the party is subject; (ii) if
			<lb />
			the award deals with the disputes not contemplated by or not
			<lb />
			falling within the submission to arbitration, or contains a decision
			<lb />
			on the matter beyond the scope of submission to arbitration; and
			<lb />
			(iii) when the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of
			<lb />
			settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force.
			<lb />
			Thus, the competence -competence principle, in its negative
			<lb />
			effect, leaves the door open for the parties to challenge the
			<lb />
			findings of the arbitral tribunal on the three issues. The negative
			<lb />
			effect does not provide absolute authority, but only a priority to the
			<lb />
			arbitral tribunal to rule the jurisdiction on the three issues. The
			<lb />
			courts have a &apos;second look&apos; on the three aspects under Section 34
			<lb />
			of the Arbitration Act. 68
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			86.
			<lb />
			The courts at the referral stage do not perform ministerial
			<lb />
			functions. They exercise and perform judicial functions when they
			<lb />
			decide objections in terms of Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration
			<lb />
			Act. Section 8 prescribes the courts to refer the parties to
			<lb />
			arbitration, if the action brought is the subject of an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement, unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement exists. Examining the term &apos;prima facie&apos;, in Nirmala J.
			<lb />
			Jhala v. State of Gujarat and Another, 69 this Court had noted:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;48. A prima facie case does not mean a case proved
			<lb />
			to the hilt but a case which can be said to be
			<lb />
			established if the evidence which is led in support of
			<lb />
			the case were [to be] believed. While determining
			<lb />
			whether a prima facie case had been made out or not
			<lb />
			the relevant consideration is whether on the evidence
			<lb />
			led it was possible to arrive at the conclusion in
			<lb />
			question and not whether that was the only
			<lb />
			conclusion which could be arrived at on that
			<lb />
			evidence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Prima facie case in the context of Section 8 is not to be
			<lb />
			confused with the merits of the case put up by the parties which
			<lb />
			has to be established before the arbitral tribunal. It is restricted to
			<lb />
			the subject matter of the suit being prima facie arbitrable under a
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			68 The nature and extent of power of judicial review under Section 34 has not been examined and
			<lb />
			answered in this reference.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			69 (2013) 4 SCC 301
			<lb />
			valid arbitration agreement. Prima facie case means that the
			<lb />
			assertions on these aspects are bona fide. When read with the
			<lb />
			principles of separation and competence-competence and Section
			<lb />
			34 of the Arbitration Act, referral court without getting bogged-down
			<lb />
			would compel the parties to abide unless there are good and
			<lb />
			substantial reasons to the contrary. 70
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			87.
			<lb />
			Prima facie examination is not full review but a primary first review
			<lb />
			to weed out manifestly and ex facie non-existent and invalid
			<lb />
			arbitration agreements and non-arbitrable disputes. The prima
			<lb />
			facie review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood and trim
			<lb />
			off the side branches in straight forward cases where dismissal is
			<lb />
			barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law the litigation
			<lb />
			must stop at the first stage. Only when the court is certain that no
			<lb />
			valid arbitration agreement exists or the disputes/subject matter
			<lb />
			are not arbitrable, the application under Section 8 would be
			<lb />
			rejected. At this stage, the court should not get lost in thickets and
			<lb />
			decide debatable questions of facts. Referral proceedings are
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			70 The European Convention on International Commercial Arbitration appears to recognise the prima
			<lb />
			facie test in Article VI (3):
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Where either party to an arbitration agreement has initiated arbitration proceedings
			<lb />
			before any resort is had to a court, courts of Contracting States subsequently asked to
			<lb />
			deal with the same subject-matter between the same parties or with the question whether
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement was non-existent or null and void or had lapsed, shall stay their
			<lb />
			ruling on the arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction until the arbitral award is made, unless they have
			<lb />
			good and substantial reasons to the contrary.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			preliminary and summary and not a mini trial. This necessarily
			<lb />
			reflects on the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the court and
			<lb />
			in this context, the observations of B.N. Srikrishna, J. of &apos;plainly
			<lb />
			arguable&apos; case in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. are of importance
			<lb />
			and relevance. Similar views are expressed by this Court in Vimal
			<lb />
			Kishore Shah wherein the test applied at the pre-arbitration stage
			<lb />
			was whether there is a &quot;good arguable case&quot; for the existence of
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement. The test of &quot;good arguable case&quot; has
			<lb />
			been elaborated by the England and Wales High Court in Silver
			<lb />
			Dry Bulk Company Limited v. Homer Hulbert Maritime
			<lb />
			Company Limited, 71 in the following words:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Good arguable case&quot; is an expression which has
			<lb />
			been hallowed by long usage, but it means different
			<lb />
			things in different contexts. For the purpose of an
			<lb />
			application under Section 18, I would hold that what
			<lb />
			must be shown is a case which is somewhat more
			<lb />
			than merely arguable, but need not be one which
			<lb />
			appears more likely than not to succeed. It shall use
			<lb />
			the term &quot;good arguable case&quot; in that sense. It
			<lb />
			represents a relatively low threshold which retains
			<lb />
			flexibility for the Court to do what is just, while
			<lb />
			excluding those cases where the jurisdictional merits
			<lb />
			were so low that reluctant respondents ought not to
			<lb />
			be put to the expense and trouble of having to decide
			<lb />
			how to deal with arbitral proceedings where it was
			<lb />
			very likely that the tribunal had no jurisdiction. In this
			<lb />
			connection it is important to remember that crossing
			<lb />
			the threshold of &quot;good arguable case&quot; means that the
			<lb />
			Court has power to make one of the orders listed in
			<lb />
			Section 18(3). It remains for consideration whether it
			<lb />
			should do so as a matter of discretion.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Appropriate at this stage would be a reference to the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Delhi High Court in NCC Ltd. v. Indian Oil
			<lb />
			Corporation Ltd., 72 wherein it has been held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;59.1 In my view, the scope of examination as to
			<lb />
			whether or not the claims lodged are Notified Claims
			<lb />
			has narrowed down considerably in view of the
			<lb />
			language of Section 11(6A) of the 1996 Act. To my
			<lb />
			mind, once the Court is persuaded that it has
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to entertain a Section 11 petition all that is
			<lb />
			required to examine is as to whether or not an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement exists between the parties
			<lb />
			which is relatable to the dispute at hand. The latter
			<lb />
			part of the exercise adverted to above, which involves
			<lb />
			correlating the dispute with the arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			obtaining between the parties, is an aspect which is
			<lb />
			implicitly embedded in sub-section (6A) of Section 11
			<lb />
			of the 1996 Act, which, otherwise, requires the Court
			<lb />
			to confine its examination only to the existence of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. Therefore, if on a bare perusal
			<lb />
			of the agreement it is found that a particular dispute is
			<lb />
			not relatable to the arbitration agreement, then,
			<lb />
			perhaps, the Court may decline the relief sought for
			<lb />
			by a party in a Section 11 petition. However, if there
			<lb />
			is a contestation with regard to the issue as to
			<lb />
			whether the dispute falls within the realm of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, then, the best course would be
			<lb />
			to allow the arbitrator to form a view in the matter.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			59.2 Thus, unless it is in a manner of speech, a chalk
			<lb />
			and cheese situation or a black and white situation
			<lb />
			without shades of grey, the concerned court hearing
			<lb />
			the Section 11 petition should follow the more
			<lb />
			conservative course of allowing parties to have their
			<lb />
			say before the arbitral tribunal.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			88.
			<lb />
			The nature and facet of non-arbitrability could also determine the
			<lb />
			level and nature of scrutiny by the court at the referral stage.
			<lb />
			Stravos Brekoulakis has differentiated between contractual
			<lb />
			aspects of arbitration agreement which the court can examine at
			<lb />
			referral stage and jurisdictional aspects of arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			which he feels should be left to the arbitral tribunal. John J.
			<lb />
			Barcelo III, referring to some American decisions had divided the
			<lb />
			issue of non-arbitrability into procedural and substantive
			<lb />
			objections. The procedurals are &apos;gateway questions&apos; which would
			<lb />
			presumptively be for the arbitrator to decide at least at the first
			<lb />
			stage. In the Indian context, we would respectfully adopt the three
			<lb />
			categories in Boghara Polyfab Private Limited. The first category
			<lb />
			of issues, namely, whether the party has approached the
			<lb />
			appropriate High Court, whether there is an arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			and whether the party who has applied for reference is party to
			<lb />
			such agreement would be subject to more thorough examination in
			<lb />
			comparison to the second and third categories/issues which are
			<lb />
			presumptively, save in exceptional cases, for the arbitrator to
			<lb />
			decide. In the first category, we would add and include the
			<lb />
			question or issue relating to whether the cause of action relates to
			<lb />
			action in personam or rem; whether the subject matter of the
			<lb />
			dispute affects third party rights, have erga omnes effect, requires
			<lb />
			centralized adjudication; whether the subject matter relates to
			<lb />
			inalienable sovereign and public interest functions of the State; and
			<lb />
			whether the subject matter of dispute is expressly or by necessary
			<lb />
			implication non-arbitrable as per mandatory statue(s). Such
			<lb />
			questions arise rarely and, when they arise, are on most occasions
			<lb />
			questions of law. On the other hand, issues relating to contract
			<lb />
			formation, existence, validity and non-arbitrability would be
			<lb />
			connected and intertwined with the issues underlying the merits of
			<lb />
			the respective disputes/claims. They would be factual and disputed
			<lb />
			and for the arbitral tribunal to decide. We would not like be too
			<lb />
			prescriptive, albeit observe that the court may for legitimate
			<lb />
			reasons, to prevent wastage of public and private resources, can
			<lb />
			exercise judicial discretion to conduct an intense yet summary
			<lb />
			prima facie review while remaining conscious that it is to assist the
			<lb />
			arbitration procedure and not usurp jurisdiction of the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal. Undertaking a detailed full review or a long-drawn review
			<lb />
			at the referral stage would obstruct and cause delay undermining
			<lb />
			the integrity and efficacy of arbitration as a dispute resolution
			<lb />
			mechanism. Conversely, if the court becomes too reluctant to
			<lb />
			intervene, it may undermine effectiveness of both the arbitration
			<lb />
			and the court. There are certain cases where the prima facie
			<lb />
			examination may require a deeper consideration. The court&apos;s
			<lb />
			challenge is to find the right amount of and the context when it
			<lb />
			would examine the prima facie case or exercise restraint. The
			<lb />
			legal order needs a right balance between avoiding arbitration
			<lb />
			obstructing tactics at referral stage and protecting parties from
			<lb />
			being forced to arbitrate when the matter is clearly non-arbitrable. 73
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			89.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, when it appears that prima facie review would be
			<lb />
			inconclusive, or on consideration inadequate as it requires detailed
			<lb />
			examination, the matter should be left for final determination by the
			<lb />
			arbitral tribunal selected by the parties by consent. The underlying
			<lb />
			rationale being not to delay or defer and to discourage parties from
			<lb />
			using referral proceeding as a rue to delay and obstruct. In such
			<lb />
			cases a full review by the courts at this stage would encroach on
			<lb />
			the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and violate the legislative
			<lb />
			scheme allocating jurisdiction between the courts and the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal. Centralisation of litigation with the arbitral tribunal as the
			<lb />
			primary and first adjudicator is beneficent as it helps in quicker and
			<lb />
			efficient resolution of disputes.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			90.
			<lb />
			The Court would exercise discretion and refer the disputes to
			<lb />
			arbitration when it is satisfied that the contest requires the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal should first decide the disputes and rule on non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability. Similarly, discretion should be exercised when the
			<lb />
			party opposing arbitration is adopting delaying tactics and
			<lb />
			impairing the referral proceedings. Appropriate in this regard, are
			<lb />
			observations of the Supreme Court of Canada in Dell Computer
			<lb />
			Corporation v. Union des consommateurs and Olivier
			<lb />
			Dumoulin, 74 which read:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;85. If the challenge requires the production and
			<lb />
			review of factual evidence, the court should normally
			<lb />
			refer the case to arbitration, as arbitrators have, for
			<lb />
			this purpose, the same resources and expertise as
			<lb />
			courts. Where questions of mixed law and fact are
			<lb />
			concerned, the court hearing the referral application
			<lb />
			must refer the case to arbitration unless the questions
			<lb />
			of fact require only superficial consideration of the
			<lb />
			documentary evidence in the record.

			86. Before departing from the general rule of referral,
			<lb />
			the court must be satisfied that the challenge to the
			<lb />
			arbitrator&apos;s jurisdiction is not a delaying tactic and that
			<lb />
			it will not unduly impair the conduct of the arbitration
			<lb />
			proceeding. This means that even when considering
			<lb />
			one of the exceptions, the court might decide that to
			<lb />
			allow the arbitrator to rule first on his or her
			<lb />
			competence would be best for the arbitration
			<lb />
			process.&quot;

		<p>
			Judgment in Dell&apos;s case has been elucidated and diluted by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court of Canada in TELUS Communications Inc. v.
			<lb />
			Avraham Wellman, viz. interpretation of Section 7(5) of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act, 1991, an aspect with which we are not concerned.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			91.
			<lb />
			We would now examine Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. As
			<lb />
			noticed above sub-section (6-A) was inserted by the Act 3 of 2016
			<lb />
			with retrospective effect from 23 rd October, 2015 and omitted by
			<lb />
			Act 33 of 2019. Section 11 (6) requires the court to appoint an
			<lb />
			arbitrator on an application made by a party. Section (6-A) to
			<lb />
			Section 11 stipulates that the court shall, at the stage of
			<lb />
			appointment under sub-section (4), (5) or (6), confine itself to the
			<lb />
			examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. Sub-
			<lb />
			section (6-A) was omitted by Act 33 of 2019, but the omission is in
			<lb />
			view of the introduction of a new regime of institutionalised
			<lb />
			arbitration as per the report of the committee headed by Justice B.
			<lb />
			N. Srikrishna, dated 30.07.2017 which records for the reason of
			<lb />
			recommending the omission as:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Thus, it can be seen that after the Amendment Act of
			<lb />
			2019, Section 11 (6-A) has been omitted because
			<lb />
			appointment of arbitrators is to be done institutionally, in
			<lb />
			which case the Supreme Court or the High Court under
			<lb />
			the old statutory regime are no longer required to
			<lb />
			appoint arbitrators and consequently to determine
			<lb />
			whether an arbitration agreement exists.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			As observed earlier, Patel Engineering Ltd. explains and
			<lb />
			holds that Sections 8 and 11 are complementary in nature as both
			<lb />
			relate to reference to arbitration. Section 8 applies when judicial
			<lb />
			proceeding is pending and an application is filed for stay of judicial
			<lb />
			proceeding and for reference to arbitration. Amendments to
			<lb />
			Section 8 vide Act 3 of 2016 have not been omitted. Section 11
			<lb />
			covers the situation where the parties approach a court for
			<lb />
			appointment of an arbitrator. Mayavati Trading Private Ltd., in
			<lb />
			our humble opinion, rightly holds that Patel Engineering Ltd. has
			<lb />
			been legislatively overruled and hence would not apply even post
			<lb />
			omission of sub-section (6-A) to Section 11 of the Arbitration Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Mayavati Trading Private Ltd. has elaborated upon the object
			<lb />
			and purposes and history of the amendment to Section 11, with
			<lb />
			reference to sub-section (6-A) to elucidate that the Section, as
			<lb />
			originally enacted, was facsimile with Article 11 of the UNCITRAL
			<lb />
			Model of law of arbitration on which the Arbitration Act was drafted
			<lb />
			and enacted. Referring to the legislative scheme of Section 11,
			<lb />
			different interpretations, and the Law Commission&apos;s Reports, it has
			<lb />
			been held that the omitted sub-section (6-A) to Section 11 of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act would continue to apply and guide the courts on its
			<lb />
			scope of jurisdiction at stage one, that is the pre-arbitration stage.
			<lb />
			Omission of sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was with the
			<lb />
			specific object and purpose and is relatable to by substitution of
			<lb />
			sub-sections (12), (13) and (14) to Section 11 of the Arbitration Act
			<lb />
			by Act 33 of 2019, which, vide sub-section (3A) stipulates that the
			<lb />
			High Court and this court shall have the power to designate the
			<lb />
			arbitral institutions which have been so graded by the Council
			<lb />
			under Section 43-I, provided where a graded arbitral institution is
			<lb />
			not available, the concerned High Court shall maintain a panel of
			<lb />
			arbitrators for discharging the function and thereupon the High
			<lb />
			Court shall perform the duty of an arbitral institution for reference
			<lb />
			to the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, it would be wrong to accept that
			<lb />
			post omission of sub-section (6-A) to Section 11 the ratio in Patel
			<lb />
			Engineering Ltd. would become applicable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			92. We now proceed to examine the question, whether the word
			<lb />
			&apos;existence&apos; in Section 11 merely refers to contract formation
			<lb />
			(whether there is an arbitration agreement) and excludes the
			<lb />
			question of enforcement (validity) and therefore the latter falls
			<lb />
			outside the jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage. On
			<lb />
			jurisprudentially and textualism it is possible to differentiate
			<lb />
			between existence of an arbitration agreement and validity of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. Such interpretation can draw support from
			<lb />
			the plain meaning of the word &quot;existence&apos;. However, it is equally
			<lb />
			possible, jurisprudentially and on contextualism, to hold that an
			<lb />
			agreement has no existence if it is not enforceable and not
			<lb />
			binding. Existence of an arbitration agreement presupposes a valid
			<lb />
			agreement which would be enforced by the court by relegating the
			<lb />
			parties to arbitration. Legalistic and plain meaning interpretation
			<lb />
			would be contrary to the contextual background including the
			<lb />
			definition clause and would result in unpalatable consequences. A
			<lb />
			reasonable and just interpretation of &apos;existence&apos; requires
			<lb />
			understanding the context, the purpose and the relevant legal
			<lb />
			norms applicable for a binding and enforceable arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. An agreement evidenced in writing has no meaning
			<lb />
			unless the parties can be compelled to adhere and abide by the
			<lb />
			terms. A party cannot sue and claim rights based on an
			<lb />
			unenforceable document. Thus, there are good reasons to hold
			<lb />
			that an arbitration agreement exists only when it is valid and legal.
			<lb />
			A void and unenforceable understanding is no agreement to do
			<lb />
			anything. Existence of an arbitration agreement means an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement that meets and satisfies the statutory
			<lb />
			requirements of both the Arbitration Act and the Contract Act and
			<lb />
			when it is enforceable in law. We would proceed to elaborate and
			<lb />
			give further reasons:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(i)
			<lb />
			In Garware Wall Ropes Ltd., this Court had examined the
			<lb />
			question of stamp duty in an underlying contract with an arbitration
			<lb />
			clause and in the context had drawn a distinction between the first
			<lb />
			and second part of Section 7(2) of the Arbitration Act, albeit the
			<lb />
			observations made and quoted above with reference to &apos;existence&apos;
			<lb />
			and &apos;validity&apos; of the arbitration agreement being apposite and
			<lb />
			extremely important, we would repeat the same by reproducing
			<lb />
			paragraph 29 thereof:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;29. This judgment in Hyundai Engg. case is
			<lb />
			important in that what was specifically under
			<lb />
			consideration was an arbitration clause which would
			<lb />
			get activated only if an insurer admits or accepts
			<lb />
			liability. Since on facts it was found that the insurer
			<lb />
			repudiated the claim, though an arbitration clause
			<lb />
			did &quot;exist&quot;, so to speak, in the policy, it would not
			<lb />
			exist in law, as was held in that judgment, when one
			<lb />
			important fact is introduced, namely, that the insurer
			<lb />
			has not admitted or accepted liability. Likewise, in
			<lb />
			the facts of the present case, it is clear that the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause that is contained in the sub-
			<lb />
			contract would not &quot;exist&quot; as a matter of law until the
			<lb />
			sub-contract is duly stamped, as has been held by
			<lb />
			us above. The argument that Section 11(6-A) deals
			<lb />
			with &quot;existence&quot;, as opposed to Section 8, Section
			<lb />
			16 and Section 45, which deal with &quot;validity&quot; of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement is answered by this Court&apos;s
			<lb />
			understanding of the expression &quot;existence&quot;
			<lb />
			in Hyundai Engg. case, as followed by us.&quot;;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Existence and validity are intertwined, and arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy
			<lb />
			mandatory legal requirements. Invalid agreement is no agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) The court at the reference stage exercises judicial
			<lb />
			powers. &apos;Examination&apos;, as an ordinary expression in common
			<lb />
			parlance, refers to an act of looking or considering something
			<lb />
			carefully in order to discover something (as per Cambridge
			<lb />
			Dictionary). It requires the person to inspect closely, to test
			<lb />
			the condition of, or to inquire into carefully (as per Merriam-
			<lb />
			Webster Dictionary). It would be rather odd for the court to
			<lb />
			hold and say that the arbitration agreement exists, though ex
			<lb />
			facie and manifestly the arbitration agreement is invalid in
			<lb />
			law and the dispute in question is non-arbitrable. The court is
			<lb />
			not powerless and would not act beyond jurisdiction, if it
			<lb />
			rejects an application for reference, when the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause is admittedly or without doubt is with a minor, lunatic
			<lb />
			or the only claim seeks a probate of a Will.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iii) Most scholars and jurists accept and agree that the
			<lb />
			existence and validity of an arbitration agreement are the
			<lb />
			same. Even Starvos Brekoulakis accepts that validity, in
			<lb />
			terms of substantive and formal validity, are questions of
			<lb />
			contract and hence for the court to examine.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iv) Most jurisdictions accept and require prima facie
			<lb />
			review by the court on non-arbitrability aspects at the referral
			<lb />
			stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(v) Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act are
			<lb />
			complementary provisions as was held in Patel Engineering
			<lb />
			Ltd.. The object and purpose behind the two provisions is
			<lb />
			identical to compel and force parties to abide by their
			<lb />
			contractual understanding. This being so, the two provisions
			<lb />
			should be read as laying down similar standard and not as
			<lb />
			laying down different and separate parameters. Section 11
			<lb />
			does not prescribe any standard of judicial review by the
			<lb />
			court for determining whether an arbitration agreement is in
			<lb />
			existence. Section 8 states that the judicial review at the
			<lb />
			stage of reference is prima facie and not final. Prima facie
			<lb />
			standard equally applies when the power of judicial review is
			<lb />
			exercised by the court under Section 11 of the Arbitration
			<lb />
			Act. Therefore, we can read the mandate of valid arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement in Section 8 into mandate of Section 11, that is,
			<lb />
			&apos;existence of an arbitration agreement&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(vi) Exercise of power of prima facie judicial review of
			<lb />
			existence as including validity is justified as a court is the first
			<lb />
			forum that examines and decides the request for the referral.
			<lb />
			Absolute &quot;hands off&quot; approach would be counterproductive
			<lb />
			and harm arbitration, as an alternative dispute resolution
			<lb />
			mechanism. Limited, yet effective intervention is acceptable
			<lb />
			as it does not obstruct but effectuates arbitration.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(vii) Exercise of the limited prima facie review does not in
			<lb />
			any way interfere with the principle of competence-
			<lb />
			competence and separation as to obstruct arbitration
			<lb />
			proceedings but ensures that vexatious and frivolous matters
			<lb />
			get over at the initial stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(viii) Exercise of prima facie power of judicial review as to
			<lb />
			the validity of the arbitration agreement would save costs
			<lb />
			and check harassment of objecting parties when there is
			<lb />
			clearly no justification and a good reason not to accept plea
			<lb />
			of non-arbitrability. In Subrata Roy Sahara v. Union of
			<lb />
			India, 75 this Court has observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;191. The Indian judicial system is grossly afflicted
			<lb />
			with frivolous litigation. Ways and means need to be
			<lb />
			evolved to deter litigants from their compulsive
			<lb />
			obsession towards senseless and ill-considered
			<lb />
			claims. One needs to keep in mind that in the process
			<lb />
			of litigation, there is an innocent sufferer on the other
			<lb />
			side of every irresponsible and senseless claim. He
			<lb />
			suffers long-drawn anxious periods of nervousness
			<lb />
			and restlessness, whilst the litigation is pending
			<lb />
			without any fault on his part. He pays for the litigation
			<lb />
			from out of his savings (or out of his borrowings)
			<lb />
			worrying that the other side may trick him into defeat
			<lb />
			for no fault of his. He spends invaluable time briefing
			<lb />
			counsel and preparing them for his claim. Time which
			<lb />
			he should have spent at work, or with his family, is
			<lb />
			lost, for no fault of his. Should a litigant not be
			<lb />
			compensated for what he has lost for no fault? The
			<lb />
			suggestion to the legislature is that a litigant who has
			<lb />
			succeeded must be compensated by the one who
			<lb />
			has lost. The suggestion to the legislature is to
			<lb />
			formulate a mechanism that anyone who initiates and
			<lb />
			continues a litigation senselessly pays for the same.
			<lb />
			It is suggested that the legislature should consider
			<lb />
			the introduction of a &quot;Code of Compulsory Costs&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(ix) Even in Duro Felguera, Kurian Joseph, J., in
			<lb />
			paragraph 52, had referred to Section 7(5) and thereafter in
			<lb />
			paragraph 53 referred to a judgment of this Court in M.R.
			<lb />
			Engineers and Contractors Private Limited v. Som Datt
			<lb />
			Builders Limited 76 to observe that the analysis in the said
			<lb />
			case supports the final conclusion that the Memorandum of
			<lb />
			Understanding in the said case did not incorporate an
			<lb />
			arbitration clause. Thereafter, reference was specifically
			<lb />
			made to Patel Engineering Ltd. and Boghara Polyfab
			<lb />
			Private Limited to observe that the legislative policy is
			<lb />
			essential to minimise court&apos;s interference at the pre-arbitral
			<lb />
			stage and this was the intention of sub-section (6) to Section
			<lb />
			11 of the Arbitration Act. Paragraph 48 in Duro Felguera
			<lb />
			specifically states that the resolution has to exist in the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, and it is for the court to see if the
			<lb />
			agreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration of
			<lb />
			disputes which have arisen between the parties. Paragraph
			<lb />
			59 is more restrictive and requires the court to see whether
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement exists -nothing more, nothing less.
			<lb />
			Read with the other findings, it would be appropriate to read
			<lb />
			the two paragraphs as laying down the legal ratio that the
			<lb />
			court is required to see if the underlying contract contains an
			<lb />
			arbitration clause for arbitration of the disputes which have
			<lb />
			arisen between the parties -nothing more, nothing less.
			<lb />
			Reference to decisions in Patel Engineering Ltd. and
			<lb />
			Boghara Polyfab Private Limited was to highlight that at
			<lb />
			the reference stage, post the amendments vide Act 3 of
			<lb />
			2016, the court would not go into and finally decide different
			<lb />
			aspects that were highlighted in the two decisions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(x) In addition to Garware Wall Ropes Limited case, this
			<lb />
			Court in Narbheram Power and Steel Private Limited and
			<lb />
			Hyundai Engg. &amp; Construction Co. Ltd., both decisions of
			<lb />
			three Judges, has rejected the application for reference in
			<lb />
			the insurance contracts holding that the claim was beyond
			<lb />
			and not covered by the arbitration agreement. The court felt
			<lb />
			that the legal position was beyond doubt as the scope of the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause was fully covered by the dictum in Vulcan
			<lb />
			Insurance Co. Ltd. Similarly, in M/s. PSA Mumbai
			<lb />
			Investments PTE. Limited, this Court at the referral stage
			<lb />
			came to the conclusion that the arbitration clause would not
			<lb />
			be applicable and govern the disputes. Accordingly, the
			<lb />
			reference to the arbitral tribunal was set aside leaving the
			<lb />
			respondent to pursue its claim before an appropriate forum.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(xi) The interpretation appropriately balances the allocation
			<lb />
			of the decision-making authority between the court at the
			<lb />
			referral stage and the arbitrators&apos; primary jurisdiction to
			<lb />
			decide disputes on merits. The court as the judicial forum of
			<lb />
			the first instance can exercise prima facie test jurisdiction to
			<lb />
			screen and knockdown ex facie meritless, frivolous and
			<lb />
			dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of the courts ensures
			<lb />
			expeditious, alacritous and efficient disposal when required
			<lb />
			at the referral stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			93.
			<lb />
			Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act states that the
			<lb />
			Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to
			<lb />
			court proceedings. Sub-section (2) states that for the purposes
			<lb />
			of the Arbitration Act and Limitation Act, arbitration shall be
			<lb />
			deemed to have commenced on the date referred to in Section
			<lb />
			21. Limitation law is procedural and normally disputes, being
			<lb />
			factual, would be for the arbitrator to decide guided by the facts
			<lb />
			found and the law applicable. The court at the referral stage can
			<lb />
			interfere only when it is manifest that the claims are ex facie
			<lb />
			time barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute. All other
			<lb />
			cases should be referred to the arbitral tribunal for decision on
			<lb />
			merits. Similar would be the position in case of disputed &apos;no
			<lb />
			claim certificate&apos; or defence on the plea of novation and &apos;accord
			<lb />
			and satisfaction&apos;. As observed in Premium Nafta Products
			<lb />
			Ltd., it is not to be expected that commercial men while
			<lb />
			entering transactions inter se would knowingly create a system
			<lb />
			which would require that the court should first decide whether
			<lb />
			the contract should be rectified or avoided or rescinded, as the
			<lb />
			case may be, and then if the contract is held to be valid, it would
			<lb />
			require the arbitrator to resolve the issues that have arisen.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			94.
			<lb />
			We would also resolve the question of principles
			<lb />
			applicable to interpretation of an arbitration clause. This is
			<lb />
			important and directly relates to scope of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. In Premium Nafta Products Ltd., on the question
			<lb />
			of interpretation and construction of an arbitration clause, it is
			<lb />
			observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;In approaching the question of construction, it is
			<lb />
			therefore necessary to inquire into the purpose of the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause. As to this, I think there can be no
			<lb />
			doubt. The parties have entered into a relationship, an
			<lb />
			agreement or what is alleged to be an agreement or
			<lb />
			what appears on its face to be an agreement, which
			<lb />
			may give rise to disputes. They want those disputes
			<lb />
			decided by a tribunal which they have chosen,
			<lb />
			commonly on the grounds of such matters as its
			<lb />
			neutrality, expertise and privacy, the availability of
			<lb />
			legal services at the seat of the arbitration and the
			<lb />
			unobtrusive efficiency of its supervisory law.
			<lb />
			Particularly in the case of international contracts, they
			<lb />
			want a quick and efficient adjudication and do not
			<lb />
			want to take the risks of delay and, in too many
			<lb />
			cases, partiality, in proceedings before a national
			<lb />
			jurisdiction.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			In Narbheram Power and Steel Private Ltd., this Court
			<lb />
			while dealing with the arbitration clause in the insurance
			<lb />
			agreement, has held that the arbitration clause should be strictly
			<lb />
			construed, relying on the principles of strict interpretation that
			<lb />
			apply to insurance contracts. These observations have been
			<lb />
			repeated in other cases.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			What is true and applicable for men of commerce and
			<lb />
			business may not be equally true and apply in case of laymen and
			<lb />
			to those who are not fully aware of the effect of an arbitration
			<lb />
			clause or had little option but to sign on the standard form contract.
			<lb />
			Broad or narrow interpretations of an arbitration agreement can, to
			<lb />
			a great extent, effect coverage of a retroactive arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement. Pro-arbitration broad interpretation, normally applied to
			<lb />
			international instruments, and commercial transactions is based
			<lb />
			upon the approach that the arbitration clause should be considered
			<lb />
			as per the true contractual language and what it says, but in case
			<lb />
			of doubt as to whether related or close disputes in the course of
			<lb />
			parties&apos; business relationship is covered by the clause, the
			<lb />
			assumption is that such disputes are encompassed by the
			<lb />
			agreement. The restrictive interpretation approach on the other
			<lb />
			hand states that in case of doubt the disputes shall not be treated
			<lb />
			as covered by the clause. Narrow approach is based on the
			<lb />
			reason that the arbitration should be viewed as an exception to the
			<lb />
			court or judicial system. The third approach is to avoid either broad
			<lb />
			or restrictive interpretation and instead the intention of the parties
			<lb />
			as to scope of the clause is understood by considering the strict
			<lb />
			language and circumstance of the case in hand. Terms like &apos;all&apos;,
			<lb />
			&apos;any&apos;, &apos;in respect of&apos;, &apos;arising out of&apos; etc. can expand the scope and
			<lb />
			ambit of the arbitration clause. Connected and incidental matters,
			<lb />
			unless the arbitration clause suggests to the contrary, would
			<lb />
			normally be covered.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			Which approach as to interpretation of an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement should be adopted in a particular case would depend
			<lb />
			upon various factors including the language, the parties, nature of
			<lb />
			relationship, the factual background in which the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement was entered, etc. In case of pure commercial disputes,
			<lb />
			more appropriate principle of interpretation would be the one of
			<lb />
			liberal construction as there is a presumption in favour of one-stop
			<lb />
			adjudication.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			95.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, we hold that the expression &apos;existence of
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement&apos; in Section 11 of the Arbitration Act,
			<lb />
			would include aspect of validity of an arbitration agreement,
			<lb />
			albeit the court at the referral stage would apply the prima facie
			<lb />
			test on the basis of principles set out in this judgment. In cases
			<lb />
			of debatable and disputable facts, and good reasonable
			<lb />
			arguable case, etc., the court would force the parties to abide
			<lb />
			by the arbitration agreement as the arbitral tribunal has primary
			<lb />
			jurisdiction and authority to decide the disputes including the
			<lb />
			question of jurisdiction and non-arbitrability.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			96.
			<lb />
			Discussion under the heading &apos;Who decides
			<lb />
			Arbitrability?&apos; can be crystallized as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(a) Ratio of the decision in Patel Engineering Ltd.
			<lb />
			on the scope of judicial review by the court while
			<lb />
			deciding an application under Sections 8 or 11 of the
			<lb />
			Arbitration Act, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016
			<lb />
			(with retrospective effect from 23.10.2015) and even
			<lb />
			post the amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect
			<lb />
			from 09.08.2019), is no longer applicable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(b) Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the
			<lb />
			court under Section 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act is
			<lb />
			identical but extremely limited and restricted.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(c) The general rule and principle, in view of the
			<lb />
			legislative mandate clear from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33
			<lb />
			of 2019, and the principle of severability and
			<lb />
			competence-competence, is that the arbitral tribunal is
			<lb />
			the preferred first authority to determine and decide all
			<lb />
			questions of non-arbitrability. The court has been
			<lb />
			conferred power of &quot;second look&quot; on aspects of non-
			<lb />
			arbitrability post the award in terms of sub-clauses (i),
			<lb />
			(ii) or (iv) of Section 34(2)(a) or sub-clause (i) of
			<lb />
			Section 34(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(d) Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at
			<lb />
			the Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex
			<lb />
			facie certain that the arbitration agreement is non-
			<lb />
			existent, invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable,
			<lb />
			though the nature and facet of non-arbitrability would,
			<lb />
			to some extent, determine the level and nature of
			<lb />
			judicial scrutiny. The restricted and limited review is to
			<lb />
			check and protect parties from being forced to arbitrate
			<lb />
			when the matter is demonstrably &apos;non-arbitrable&apos; and to
			<lb />
			cut off the deadwood. The court by default would refer
			<lb />
			the matter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability
			<lb />
			are plainly arguable; when consideration in summary
			<lb />
			proceedings would be insufficient and inconclusive;
			<lb />
			when facts are contested; when the party opposing
			<lb />
			arbitration adopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings. This is not the stage for the
			<lb />
			court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review so as
			<lb />
			to usurp the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal but to
			<lb />
			affirm and uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as
			<lb />
			an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.

			<lb />
			DECEMBER 14, 2020.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			N. V. RAMANA, J.
			<lb />
			1. I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinion
			<lb />
			of my learned Brother Justice Sanjiv Khanna. The present
			<lb />
			matters deal with a very important aspect in the arbitration
			<lb />
			jurisprudence in this country, which necessitate a separate
			<lb />
			opinion.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2. Recently, Mr. Fali S. Nariman, in one of his lectures had
			<lb />
			alluded that the development of arbitration in India is not
			<lb />
			attributable to the success in arbitration, rather to the
			<lb />
			failures of the Court. This reflects an uncomfortable
			<lb />
			relationship which arbitration has had with litigation all
			<lb />
			these days. The judicial hesitancy of the courts to be more
			<lb />
			accommodative towards the tribunal and the need for
			<lb />
			respecting arbitral awards requires this Court to extensively
			<lb />
			reflect and bring the Court&apos;s jurisprudence in tune with the
			<lb />
			liberal intention sought to be furthered post the 2015
			<lb />
			amendment to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
			<lb />
			(hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act&quot;).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3. Before we delve into the merits of the matters, we need to
			<lb />
			have a brief reference to the facts which are necessary for
			<lb />
			the disposal of these cases. As all the cases are similar, we
			<lb />
			take facts from Civil Appeal No. 2402 of 2019, to indicate
			<lb />
			the history of this litigation and the questions which arise
			<lb />
			from the same. In the year 2006, appellants (tenants)
			<lb />
			entered into a tenancy agreement with the predecessor title
			<lb />
			holder with respect to certain buildings. Clause 23 of the
			<lb />
			agreement contained a dispute resolution clause. In the
			<lb />
			year 2012, the tenancy was attorned to the respondent,
			<lb />
			after which the appellants started paying monthly rent to
			<lb />
			the respondent (landlord). On 24.08.2015, the respondent
			<lb />
			(landlord) wrote a letter seeking vacant possession of the
			<lb />
			property as the period of lease was expiring on 01.02.2016.
			<lb />
			Appellants (tenants) did not vacate. Aggrieved, the
			<lb />
			respondent (landlord) invoked the arbitration under the
			<lb />
			dispute resolution mechanism provided under the contract.
			<lb />
			On 28.04.2016, the respondent filed the present Section 11
			<lb />
			petition before the Calcutta High Court for appointment of
			<lb />
			an arbitrator. On 07.09.2016, the High Court passed the
			<lb />
			impugned order appointing an arbitrator, after rejecting the
			<lb />
			appellants objections on the arbitrability of the dispute.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4. Aggrieved by the same, the appellants (tenants) have
			<lb />
			approached this Court in the present proceedings, on the
			<lb />
			reason that, after the judgment of the High Court was
			<lb />
			rendered appointing the arbitrator, this Court in Himangni
			<lb />
			Enterprises v. Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia, (2017) 10
			<lb />
			SCC 706 [hereinafter referred as &apos;Himangni Enterprises&apos;]
			<lb />
			held that where the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 applied
			<lb />
			between the landlord and tenant disputes between the said
			<lb />
			parties would not be arbitrable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5. When Civil Appeal No. 2402 of 2019 was listed for hearing
			<lb />
			on 28.02.2019, then the said matter was referred to a three
			<lb />
			Judge Bench, with following observations:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;7. It will be noticed that &quot;validity&quot; of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement is, therefore, apart
			<lb />
			from its &quot;existence&quot;. One moot question
			<lb />
			that therefore, arises, and which needs to
			<lb />
			be authoritatively decided by a Bench of
			<lb />
			three learned Judges, is whether the word
			<lb />
			&quot;existence&quot; would include weedingout
			<lb />
			arbitration clauses in agreements which
			<lb />
			indicate that the subjectmatter is
			<lb />
			incapable of arbitration…
			<lb />
			x x x x x
			<lb />
			x x x x x
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			30. In this view of the matter, this case is
			<lb />
			referred to a Bench of three Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Judges.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31. Given the facts of this case and the
			<lb />
			fact that 18 hearings have been held, the
			<lb />
			stay that has been granted to the arbitral
			<lb />
			proceedings by our order dated 13.08.2018
			<lb />
			is lifted, and the proceedings may go on
			<lb />
			and culminate in an award. The award
			<lb />
			cannot be executed without applying to
			<lb />
			this Court. The appeal is disposed of
			<lb />
			accordingly.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6. The reference order primarily indicates that there are two
			<lb />
			substantive issues to be settled by this Court herein,
			<lb />
			namely:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			I.
			<lb />
			To what extent does the Court decide the question of
			<lb />
			nonarbitrability under Section 11 of the Act?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			II.
			<lb />
			Whether tenancy disputes are capable of being
			<lb />
			resolved through arbitration?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7. Before we analyze the issue, we need to observe arguments
			<lb />
			canvassed by the counsel appearing for the parties, who set
			<lb />
			the tone for these cases.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8. Learned senior counsel, Mr. K. V. Vishwanathan, appearing
			<lb />
			for the petitioners in SLP (C.) No. 56055606 of 2019,
			<lb />
			submitted as under:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 That Section 11(6A) of the Act is a unique provision,
			<lb />
			which is neither traceable to UNCITRAL Model Law nor
			<lb />
			any other domestic legislation.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 In spite of the absence of legislative provision in other
			<lb />
			countries, Courts have adjudicated on the existence of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement at the stage of the
			<lb />
			appointment of the arbitrator itself.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			 The standard of &apos;good arguable case&apos; as expounded in
			<lb />
			Noble Denton Middle East v. Noble Denton
			<lb />
			International Ltd., [2010] EWHC 2574 (Comm.),
			<lb />
			should be applied by the Courts to examine the
			<lb />
			existence of a valid arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			 Therefore, the scope of judicial enquiry at the stage of
			<lb />
			reference/appointment is not limited to the mere
			<lb />
			presence of the arbitration clause.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			Learned Senior advocate, Mr. Nakul Dewan on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Respondent in SLP (C.) No. 56055606 of 2019, argued that:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 Section 11(6A) was a conscious departure from the
			<lb />
			earlier existing judicial interpretation, which had
			<lb />
			widened the scope of judicial enquiry.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			 The 246 th Law Commission Report stated that Section
			<lb />
			11(6A) limits the scope of judicial enquiry to
			<lb />
			determination of a prima facie existence.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 Word &apos;existence&apos; under Section 11(6A) means legally
			<lb />
			enforceable existence and not mere presence in the
			<lb />
			contract.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 While examining the issue of existence in an
			<lb />
			application under Section 11, this Court is merely
			<lb />
			functioning as an appointing authority.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10. Learned senior counsel, Mr. Manoj Swarup on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Petitioner in SLP (C.) No. 11877 of 2020, has submitted
			<lb />
			that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			 Lease hold rights under the Transfer of Property Act,
			<lb />
			1882 [hereinafter referred to as &quot;TP Act&quot;]are rights in
			<lb />
			rem.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 A contractual tenant upon determination of lease
			<lb />
			becomes a statutory tenant and is entitled to the
			<lb />
			statutory protection. Therefore, the arbitration in that
			<lb />
			case would be ousted.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 Section 11 is not the stage for determination of the
			<lb />
			issue of arbitrability in those cases where the test of
			<lb />
			Section 89, CPC is to be applied.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11. Learned senior counsel, Mr. Gopal Shankarnarayan on
			<lb />
			behalf of the Petitioners in SLP (C.) No. 56055606 of 2019,
			<lb />
			submitted that:
			<lb />
			 Section 11(6A) mandates an &apos;examination of the
			<lb />
			evidence of an arbitration agreement&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			 The 2015 Amendment does not convert the judicial
			<lb />
			power conferred in Section 11(6) into an administrative
			<lb />
			power.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			 The decision in Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Pradyuat Deb Burman, (2019) 8 SCC 714 is
			<lb />
			inapplicable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12. Learned counsel, Mr. Sourav Agarwal on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 2402 of 2019, contended
			<lb />
			that:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 the Court under Section 8 and 11 of the Act, does not
			<lb />
			act as a mere postoffice.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 this is a case in which the appellants have participated
			<lb />
			in the arbitral proceedings.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 Relying upon various judgments, including certain
			<lb />
			High Court judgments that were passed after the
			<lb />
			judgment in Himangni Enterprises (supra) to state
			<lb />
			that, on facts, Himangni Enterprises (supra) was
			<lb />
			wholly distinguishable as it did not apply to a situation
			<lb />
			of a lease expiring by efflux of time.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			 certain High Court judgments had, after the judgment
			<lb />
			in Himangni Enterprises (supra), distinguished the
			<lb />
			said judgment on this and other grounds. As an
			<lb />
			alternative submission, he said that, in any case,
			<lb />
			Himangni
			<lb />
			Enterprises
			<lb />
			(supra) would
			<lb />
			require
			<lb />
			reconsideration as it did not state the law correctly.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13. We answer the two questions in seriatim.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14. Arbitration is a creature of consensus. It is completely
			<lb />
			dependent on party autonomy and the intention expressed
			<lb />
			in the agreement. A contract, having multiple clauses
			<lb />
			including arbitration agreements, can be divided into two
			<lb />
			parts. The clauses relating to the commercial relationship,
			<lb />
			i.e., the obligations and duties of each party, can be referred
			<lb />
			to as the &apos;main contract&apos;. The arbitration agreement so to
			<lb />
			say is a separate contract in itself.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15. The separability of the arbitration agreement from the main
			<lb />
			contract, historically existed in Roman law. Since early
			<lb />
			times, arbitration was viewed with suspicion, which allowed
			<lb />
			for the development of separability. Ironically, the &apos;pro
			<lb />
			arbitration&apos; function of separability in the present day is a
			<lb />
			late 19 th and 20 th century development, traceable to
			<lb />
			Germanic and Swiss jurisprudence.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16. In India, arbitration was governed earlier by the Arbitration
			<lb />
			Act of 1899, and later 1940. Presently, arbitration is
			<lb />
			governed by the Act of 1996, with subsequent amendments.
			<lb />
			A cursory reading of the legislative history points to the fact
			<lb />
			that the intention of the legislature is to make the regime
			<lb />
			&apos;proarbitration&apos;. Whenever this Court has afforded a
			<lb />
			contrary view, there has been a trend to undo the changes
			<lb />
			to bring it in line with the international standards prevailing
			<lb />
			in certain arbitration havens such as Singapore, London
			<lb />
			and Hong Kong.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17. Before we move to the analysis of the case, we need to
			<lb />
			briefly describe the structure of the Arbitration Act, 1996
			<lb />
			with subsequent amendments. The setup of both
			<lb />
			international and domestic arbitration is contained under
			<lb />
			PARTS I, IA and II of the Act. The preamble to the Act
			<lb />
			provides that it was enacted with a view to have uniformity
			<lb />
			of the law of arbitral procedures to establish a fair and
			<lb />
			efficient mechanism to resolve disputes.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18. Section 2 provides for the definition of &apos;arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement&apos; which is to be interpreted in terms of Section 7
			<lb />
			of the Act, which states as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			7. Arbitration agreement. -
			<lb />
			(1) In this Part, &quot;arbitration agreement&quot; means an
			<lb />
			agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration
			<lb />
			all or certain disputes which have arisen or which
			<lb />
			may arise between them in respect of a defined
			<lb />
			legal relationship, whether contractual or not.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of
			<lb />
			an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form
			<lb />
			of a separate agreement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is
			<lb />
			contained in-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) a document signed by the parties;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or
			<lb />
			other means of telecommunication including
			<lb />
			communication through electronic means which
			<lb />
			provide a record of the agreement; or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) an exchange of statements of claim and
			<lb />
			defence in which the existence of the agreement is
			<lb />
			alleged by one party and not denied by the other.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(5) The reference in a contract to a document
			<lb />
			containing an arbitration clause constitutes an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing
			<lb />
			and the reference is such as to make that
			<lb />
			arbitration clause part of the contract.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			19. Section 5 emphasizes a very important principle, that
			<lb />
			judicial interference in arbitral proceedings should be
			<lb />
			minimum and should be limited to instances where it is
			<lb />
			specifically provided for under the Act. Although the
			<lb />
			provision envisages a wide amplitude, various judgments of
			<lb />
			this Court have restricted the utility of same. [ICICI Bank
			<lb />
			Ltd. v. Sidco Leathers Ltd., (2006) 10 SCC 452]

		<p>
			Under the old Arbitration Act, 1940, the Court had the
			<lb />
			discretion in referring the parties to arbitration, however
			<lb />
			such discretion is done away with after the coming into
			<lb />
			force of the 1996 Act. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
			<lb />
			1996 does not, in specific terms, exclude any category of
			<lb />
			disputes-civil or commercial-from arbitrability. Intrinsic
			<lb />
			legislative material is in fact to the contrary. Section 8
			<lb />
			contains a mandate that where an action is brought before a
			<lb />
			judicial authority in a matter which is the subject of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, the parties shall be referred by it to
			<lb />
			arbitration, if a party to or a person claiming through a
			<lb />
			party to the arbitration agreement applies not later than the
			<lb />
			date of submitting the first statement on the substance of
			<lb />
			the dispute. The only exception is where the authority finds,
			<lb />
			prima facie, that there is no valid arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
			Section 8 contains a positive mandate and obligates the
			<lb />
			judicial authority to refer parties to arbitration in terms of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement. While dispensing with the
			<lb />
			element of judicial discretion, the statute imposes an
			<lb />
			affirmative obligation on every judicial authority to hold
			<lb />
			down parties to the terms of the agreement entered into
			<lb />
			between them to refer disputes to arbitration. Article 8 of
			<lb />
			the UNCITRAL Model Law enabled a court to decline to refer
			<lb />
			parties to arbitration if it is found that the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being
			<lb />
			performed. Section 8 of the Act has made a departure from
			<lb />
			the UNCITRAL law which is indicative of the wide reach and
			<lb />
			ambit of the statutory mandate. Section 8 uses the
			<lb />
			expansive expression &quot;judicial authority&quot; rather than &quot;court&quot;
			<lb />
			and the words &quot;unless it finds that the agreement is null
			<lb />
			and void, inoperative and incapable of being performed&quot; do
			<lb />
			not find place in Section 8.

			<lb />
			Malhotra, comments as under:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			Section 8 was amended by the 2015
			<lb />
			Amendment to clarify the scope of
			<lb />
			enquiry by the judicial authority at the
			<lb />
			prereference stage. The court would be
			<lb />
			required to make a prima facie
			<lb />
			determination as to whether there is valid
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. 77
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			We must state that we are partly in agreement with the
			<lb />
			aforesaid, wherein the judicial authorities have been given a
			<lb />
			clear mandate for interference at the prereference stage,
			<lb />
			however, the threshold standard is worded differently, as
			<lb />
			pointed herein.

			23. Section 12 imposes, upon a person approached to be an
			<lb />
			arbitrator, the obligation to disclose to the parties in writing
			<lb />
			any circumstance that may give rise to justifiable doubts as
			<lb />
			to his independence and impartiality. An arbitrator can be
			<lb />
			challenged if there are circumstances that give rise to
			<lb />
			justifiable doubts about his independence and impartiality
			<lb />
			or if he does not possess the qualifications agreed to by
			<lb />
			parties, but such challenge can be made only for reasons
			<lb />
			which the party challenging becomes aware of after the
			<lb />
			appointment has been made. Section 13 speaks of the
			<lb />
			challenge procedure. It states that the parties are free to
			<lb />
			agree on such a procedure. Failing that, the party who
			<lb />
			makes the challenge must within fifteen days after
			<lb />
			becoming aware of the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal
			<lb />
			or of any of the circumstances mentioned in Section 12,
			<lb />
			send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to
			<lb />
			the Arbitral Tribunal. Unless the challenged arbitrator
			<lb />
			withdraws or the other party to the arbitration agrees to the
			<lb />
			challenge, the Arbitral Tribunal shall decide upon the
			<lb />
			challenge and if the challenge is not successful it shall
			<lb />
			continue the arbitration proceedings and make an award.
			<lb />
			That award can be sought to be set aside under Section 34.

		<p>
			24. Section 16 empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its
			<lb />
			own jurisdiction. Subsection (1) of Section 16 is relevant,
			<lb />
			and reads thus:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;16. (1) The Arbitral Tribunal may rule
			<lb />
			on its own jurisdiction, including
			<lb />
			ruling on any objections with respect
			<lb />
			to the existence or validity of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, and for that
			<lb />
			purpose,-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) an arbitration clause which forms
			<lb />
			part of a contract shall be treated as
			<lb />
			an agreement independent of the other
			<lb />
			terms of the contract; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) a decision by the Arbitral Tribunal
			<lb />
			that the contract is null and void shall
			<lb />
			not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause.&quot;

			The intention of the legislators to provide for Section 34 in
			<lb />
			its present form, is to have a limited review of the award
			<lb />
			instead of a fullfledged appeal process. A party intending to
			<lb />
			object to an award, is first required to file an application
			<lb />
			under Section 34 (1) indicating the objections along with the
			<lb />
			copy of an award and other necessary documents, which are
			<lb />
			required as proof to satisfy grounds provided under Section
			<lb />
			34(2)(a) and (b) of the Act. Such complete petition is
			<lb />
			required to be filed within the time period prescribed under
			<lb />
			Section 34 (3) of the Act, failing which the appeal is
			<lb />
			rendered nugatory. The limitation prescribed under Section
			<lb />
			34(3) is bound with the right to file objections itself. The
			<lb />
			objections filed under Section 34 must be relatable to the
			<lb />
			limited grounds provided under Section 34 (2) of the Act. It
			<lb />
			is the legislative intention to provide for numerous
			<lb />
			limitations under Section 34 of the Act, which are required
			<lb />
			to be strictly adhered to so as to make Indian arbitration
			<lb />
			timebound and commercially prudent to opt for the same.
			<lb />
			Section 37 of the Act, provides for limited appeal against the
			<lb />
			Section 34 order, as well as against certain other specified
			<lb />
			orders.

			27. The present structure of arbitration is such that Courts are
			<lb />
			to assist and support arbitration and leave the substantive
			<lb />
			part of adjudication to the arbitral tribunal. Some scholars
			<lb />
			have suggested that the judicial mechanism that comports
			<lb />
			with the rule of law may be fundamentally at odds with non
			<lb />
			judicial/arbitral mechanism which is therefore less formal.
			<lb />
			But our understanding is that that the rule of law is less in
			<lb />
			tension with arbitration than critics imagine, because they
			<lb />
			both aim to serve the same goalthe pursuit of justice.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			28. On a plain reading of the Act, whenever a dispute arises
			<lb />
			between parties, they are free to approach an appropriate
			<lb />
			judicial forum to get their dispute resolved. If the parties
			<lb />
			have contemplated an arbitration agreement, then they can
			<lb />
			approach a tribunal for getting the matter resolved. Once
			<lb />
			they choose the nonjudicial method, a party aggrieved by
			<lb />
			the award, has a chance to approach judicial institutions
			<lb />
			under Section 34 and 37 (appeal jurisdiction), if the award
			<lb />
			is violative of the grounds provided thereunder.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			29. With this understanding, we need to have regards to certain
			<lb />
			precedents of this Court, in order to understand the
			<lb />
			dispute. The case, which started the debate was the case of
			<lb />
			Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. v. Mehul Construction Co.,
			<lb />
			(2000) 7 SCC 201, wherein a Bench of three Judges of this
			<lb />
			Court, emphasized the utility of &apos;Chief Justice&apos; as occurring
			<lb />
			under the earlier Section 11, to come to a conclusion that
			<lb />
			the power of appointment of an arbitrator was an
			<lb />
			administrative action. The proposition laid down in the
			<lb />
			aforesaid case, was confirmed by a Constitution Bench of
			<lb />
			this Court in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. v. Rani
			<lb />
			Construction (P.) Ltd., (2002) 2 SCC 388. It may be
			<lb />
			relevant to quote the following observation by this Court:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;21. It might also be that in a given case
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice or his designate may
			<lb />
			have nominated an arbitrator although
			<lb />
			the period of thirty days had not expired.
			<lb />
			If so, the Arbitral Tribunal would have
			<lb />
			been improperly constituted and be
			<lb />
			without jurisdiction. It would then be
			<lb />
			open to the aggrieved party to require the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. Section 16 provides for this.
			<lb />
			It states that the Arbitral Tribunal may
			<lb />
			rule on its own jurisdiction. That the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal may rule &quot;on any
			<lb />
			objections
			<lb />
			with
			<lb />
			respect
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			existence or validity of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement&quot; shows that the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal&apos;s authority under Section 16
			<lb />
			is not confined to the width of its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction, as was submitted by
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the appellants, but
			<lb />
			goes to the very root of its
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. There would, therefore, be
			<lb />
			no impediment in contending before the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal that it had been wrongly
			<lb />
			constituted by reason of the fact that the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice or his designate had
			<lb />
			nominated an arbitrator although the
			<lb />
			period of thirty days had not expired and
			<lb />
			that, therefore, it had no jurisdiction.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			30. Again, the aforesaid decision came to be referred to a seven
			<lb />
			Judge Bench in SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2005) 8 SCC 618, wherein majority was penned by Justice
			<lb />
			P.K. Balasubramanyan and the minority dissent was by
			<lb />
			Justice C. K. Thakker.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31. The majority opinion, concluded that the power of reference
			<lb />
			under Section 11 is a judicial function for the following
			<lb />
			reasons:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			First, the subsection (7) of Section 11 makes the
			<lb />
			adjudication by the Chief Justice, final. Such final
			<lb />
			determination in usual course would be a judicial
			<lb />
			determination.
			<lb />
			Second, the reason for delegating the power to the
			<lb />
			highest judicial authority in the State or the Country,
			<lb />
			is to provide credibility for the process.
			<lb />
			Third, the power of a persona designata cannot be
			<lb />
			delegated, unless such power is judicial power.
			<lb />
			Fourth, Section 8 and 11 are complimentary and the
			<lb />
			ambit of power is the same.
			<lb />
			Fifth, the principle of KompetenzKompetenz, as
			<lb />
			enshrined under Section 16, will come to play only if
			<lb />
			the parties approach the Arbitral Tribunal, without
			<lb />
			taking recourse to Section 8 or 11.
			<lb />
			Sixth, it is incongruous to permit the order of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice under Section 11(6) of the Act being subjected
			<lb />
			to scrutiny under Article 226 of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Seventh, the Court on earlier instances did not
			<lb />
			concentrate on the threshold satisfaction of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice, before the same is referred to an arbitration.
			<lb />
			Eighth, it would be a wasteful exercise for parties to
			<lb />
			arbitrate on the jurisdiction, only to find that tribunal
			<lb />
			did not have sufficient jurisdiction to entertain the
			<lb />
			arbitration.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			32. The minority view posits that the function of the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice was administrative rather than judicial, for the
			<lb />
			following reasons:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			First, merely because a decision adversely affects a
			<lb />
			party, cannot be the sole reason to conclude that the
			<lb />
			function is judicial.
			<lb />
			Second, finality of decision taken by the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			under Section 11(7) refers to only matters such as
			<lb />
			qualification, independence and impartiality of the
			<lb />
			arbitrator. The aforesaid does not necessarily make the
			<lb />
			determination judicial or quasijudicial.
			<lb />
			Third, Section 16 spells out a rule of chronological
			<lb />
			priority.
			<lb />
			Fourth, Section 16 has a negative effect, that is, it
			<lb />
			allows the arbitrators to decide their jurisdiction prior
			<lb />
			to the Courts stepping in post rendering of the award.
			<lb />
			Fifth, there is a duty cast upon the Chief Justice under
			<lb />
			Section 11(6) &apos;to act fairly&apos;.
			<lb />
			In our consideration, the aforesaid case was heavily caught
			<lb />
			in the obfuscated concept of judicial or administrative duty,
			<lb />
			and there is scarce observation on the appropriate
			<lb />
			standards of judicial enquiry or what aspects does the Court
			<lb />
			need to consider, while referring a matter to arbitration.
			<lb />

			33. In ShinEtsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2005) 7 SCC 234, this Court decided the ambit of Section
			<lb />
			45 of the Act, which relates to the provision for referring
			<lb />
			parties to arbitration under the New York Convention. While
			<lb />
			deciding the scope of Section 45 of the Act, Justice Y. K.
			<lb />
			Sabharwal, as he then was, held in his opinion that a
			<lb />
			judicial forum seized of the mater should fully rule on the
			<lb />
			validity and existence of the agreement, before referring the
			<lb />
			same to the arbitration. The prima facie standard, which the
			<lb />
			Court found to be gaining popularity across the globe, could
			<lb />
			not be applied as the statutory language of Section 45, as it
			<lb />
			existed, did not support such a standard. It may be
			<lb />
			necessary to observe certain passage from Justice
			<lb />
			Sabharwal&apos;s opinion:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;55. I may also deal with the contention urged
			<lb />
			on behalf of the appellant that only a prima
			<lb />
			facie finding is required to be given on a
			<lb />
			combined reading of Sections 45, 48 and 50
			<lb />
			from which it can be culled out that a party
			<lb />
			who has suffered an award can always
			<lb />
			challenge the same under Section 48 on the
			<lb />
			ground that the arbitration agreement is null
			<lb />
			and void. This read in conjunction with the
			<lb />
			right of appeal given under Section 50 and the
			<lb />
			power of the arbitrator to rule on his own
			<lb />
			jurisdiction clearly shows the intent of the
			<lb />
			legislature to avoid delay which would be
			<lb />
			inevitable if it has to be a final decision and it
			<lb />
			would defeat the object of soon placing all
			<lb />
			material before the Arbitral Tribunal. I am
			<lb />
			afraid that this cannot be accepted as the real
			<lb />
			purpose of Section 48 is to ensure that at
			<lb />
			some stage whether preaward, postaward or
			<lb />
			both, a judicial authority must decide the
			<lb />
			validity, operation, capability of performance of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement. In various cases the
			<lb />
			parties may not resort to Section 45 in the first
			<lb />
			place, and to overcome such eventuality, the
			<lb />
			legislature has enacted Section 48(1)(a). In
			<lb />
			other words, if the court is not asked to satisfy
			<lb />
			itself as to the validity of the agreement at a
			<lb />
			preaward stage (Section 45), then by virtue of
			<lb />
			Section 48, it is given another opportunity to
			<lb />
			do so. Apart from this, under Section 48, the
			<lb />
			court may refuse to enforce the foreign award
			<lb />
			on the ground other than the invalidity of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. As far as the question
			<lb />
			of Section 50 is concerned, it is well settled in
			<lb />
			law that an appeal is a creature of statute (M.
			<lb />
			Ramnarain (P) Ltd. v. State Trading Corpn. of
			<lb />
			India Ltd. [(1983) 3 SCC 75] ) and a right to
			<lb />
			appeal inheres in no one. (Gujarat Agro
			<lb />
			Industries Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Corpn. of the
			<lb />
			City of Ahmedabad [(1999) 4 SCC 468]). The
			<lb />
			legislature under Section 50 has clearly
			<lb />
			allowed appeal only in case the judicial
			<lb />
			authority refuses to refer the parties to
			<lb />
			arbitration or refuses to enforce the foreign
			<lb />
			award. The fact that a provision is not made
			<lb />
			for an appeal in case reference is made to
			<lb />
			arbitration is not a ground to say that the
			<lb />
			court should prima facie decide the validity of
			<lb />
			the agreement ignoring the express provisions
			<lb />
			of Section 45. The legislature has granted the
			<lb />
			right of appeal in the event of refusal to refer
			<lb />
			but not in the event of order being made for
			<lb />
			reference of the parties to arbitration. This
			<lb />
			provision for appeal is not determinative of the
			<lb />
			scope of Section 45 to mean that the
			<lb />
			determination thereunder to be only prima
			<lb />
			facie.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Justice B. N. Srikrishna, on the other hand, held that the
			<lb />
			language of Section 8 and 45 are different, wherein the
			<lb />
			judicial authority is empowered under Section 45 to refuse
			<lb />
			reference to arbitration, if it finds that the agreement is &apos;null
			<lb />
			and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed&apos;. He
			<lb />
			further held that ex visceribus interpretation of the Section
			<lb />
			45 clearly points to a prima facie view. Justice
			<lb />
			Dharmadhikari, for different reasons, agreed with the
			<lb />
			reasoning of Justice B. N. Srikrishna, in the following
			<lb />
			manner:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;111. With utmost respect to both of them, I
			<lb />
			am inclined to agree with the view expressed
			<lb />
			by learned Brother Srikrishna, J. but only
			<lb />
			with a rider and a partly different reason
			<lb />
			which may I state below:
			<lb />
			The main issue is regarding the scope of
			<lb />
			power of any judicial authority including a
			<lb />
			regular civil court under Section 45 of the Act
			<lb />
			in making or refusing a reference of dispute
			<lb />
			arising from an international arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement governed by the provisions
			<lb />
			contained in Part III Chapter I of the Act of
			<lb />
			1996. I respectfully agree with learned
			<lb />
			Brother Srikrishna, J. only to the extent that
			<lb />
			if on a prima facie examination of the
			<lb />
			documents and material on record including
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement on which request
			<lb />
			for reference is made by one of the parties, the
			<lb />
			judicial authority or the court decides to make
			<lb />
			a reference, it may merely mention the
			<lb />
			submissions and contentions of the parties
			<lb />
			and summarily decide the objection if any
			<lb />
			raised on the alleged nullity, voidness,
			<lb />
			inoperativeness
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			incapability
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. In case, however, on a
			<lb />
			prima facie view of the matter, which is
			<lb />
			required to be objectively taken on the basis of
			<lb />
			material and evidence produced by the parties
			<lb />
			on the record of the case, the judicial
			<lb />
			authority including a regular civil court, is
			<lb />
			inclined to reject the request for reference on
			<lb />
			the ground that the agreement is &quot;null and
			<lb />
			void&quot; or &quot;inoperative&quot; or &quot;incapable of being
			<lb />
			performed&quot; within the meaning of Section 45
			<lb />
			of the Act, the judicial authority or the court
			<lb />
			must afford full opportunities to the parties to
			<lb />
			lead whatever documentary or oral evidence
			<lb />
			they want to lead and then decide the
			<lb />
			question like trial of a preliminary issue on
			<lb />
			jurisdiction or limitation in a regular civil suit
			<lb />
			and pass an elaborate reasoned order. Where
			<lb />
			a judicial authority or the court refuses to
			<lb />
			make a reference on the grounds available
			<lb />
			under Section 45 of the Act, it is necessary for
			<lb />
			the judicial authority or the court which is
			<lb />
			seized of the matter to pass a reasoned order
			<lb />
			as the same is subject to appeal to the
			<lb />
			appellate court under Section 50(1)(a) of the
			<lb />
			Act and further appeal to this Court under
			<lb />
			subsection (2) of the said section.&quot;

			<lb />
			(2007) 4 SCC 599, while observing the scope of the Court
			<lb />
			under Section 11 (6), the Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;27……..A glance on this para would suggest
			<lb />
			the scope of the order under Section 11 to be
			<lb />
			passed by the Chief Justice or his designate.
			<lb />
			Insofar as the issues regarding territorial
			<lb />
			jurisdiction and the existence of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement are concerned, the Chief Justice or
			<lb />
			his designate has to decide those issues
			<lb />
			because otherwise the arbitration can never
			<lb />
			proceed. Thus, the Chief Justice has to decide
			<lb />
			about the territorial jurisdiction and also
			<lb />
			whether there exists an arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			between the parties and whether such party
			<lb />
			has approached the court for appointment of
			<lb />
			the arbitrator. The Chief Justice has to
			<lb />
			examine as to whether the claim is a dead one
			<lb />
			or in the sense whether the parties have
			<lb />
			already concluded the transaction and have
			<lb />
			recorded satisfaction of their mutual rights
			<lb />
			and obligations or whether the parties
			<lb />
			concerned have recorded their satisfaction
			<lb />
			regarding the financial claims. In examining
			<lb />
			this if the parties have recorded their
			<lb />
			satisfaction regarding the financial claims,
			<lb />
			there will be no question of any issue
			<lb />
			remaining. It is in this sense that the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice has to examine as to whether there
			<lb />
			remains anything to be decided between the
			<lb />
			parties in respect of the agreement and
			<lb />
			whether the parties are still at issue on any
			<lb />
			such matter. If the Chief Justice does not, in
			<lb />
			the strict sense, decide the issue, in that event
			<lb />
			it is for him to locate such issue and record his
			<lb />
			satisfaction that such issue exists between the
			<lb />
			parties. It is only in that sense that the finding
			<lb />
			on a live issue is given. Even at the cost of
			<lb />
			repetition we must state that it is only for the
			<lb />
			purpose of finding out whether the arbitral
			<lb />
			procedure has to be started that the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice has to record satisfaction that there
			<lb />
			remains a live issue in between the parties.
			<lb />
			The same thing is about the limitation which is
			<lb />
			always a mixed question of law and fact. The
			<lb />
			Chief Justice only has to record his
			<lb />
			satisfaction that prima facie the issue has not
			<lb />
			become dead by the lapse of time or that any
			<lb />
			party to the agreement has not slept over its
			<lb />
			rights beyond the time permitted by law to
			<lb />
			agitate those issues covered by the agreement.
			<lb />
			It is for this reason that it was pointed out in
			<lb />
			the above para that it would be appropriate
			<lb />
			sometimes to leave the question regarding the
			<lb />
			live claim to be decided by the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal. All that he has to do is to record his
			<lb />
			satisfaction that the parties have not closed
			<lb />
			their rights and the matter has not been
			<lb />
			barred by limitation. Thus, where the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice comes to a finding that there exists a
			<lb />
			live issue, then naturally this finding would
			<lb />
			include a finding that the respective claims of
			<lb />
			the parties have not become barred by
			<lb />
			limitation.&quot;

			&quot;19. In SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd. [(2005) 8
			<lb />
			SCC 618] , a sevenJudge Bench of this Court
			<lb />
			considered the scope of Section 11 of the Act
			<lb />
			and held that the scheme of Section 11 of the
			<lb />
			Act required the Chief Justice or his designate
			<lb />
			to decide whether there is an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement in terms of Section 7 of the Act
			<lb />
			before exercising his power under Section
			<lb />
			11(6) of the Act and its implications. … This
			<lb />
			Court held: (SCC pp. 66061 &amp; 663, paras 39
			<lb />
			&amp; 47)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;39.… He has to decide whether there is an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, as defined in the Act and
			<lb />
			whether the person who has made the request
			<lb />
			before him, is a party to such an agreement. It
			<lb />
			is necessary to indicate that he can also decide
			<lb />
			the question whether the claim was a dead one;
			<lb />
			or a longbarred claim that was sought to be
			<lb />
			resurrected and whether the parties have
			<lb />
			concluded the transaction by recording
			<lb />
			satisfaction of their mutual rights and
			<lb />
			obligations or by receiving the final payment
			<lb />
			without objection. … For the purpose of taking a
			<lb />
			decision on these aspects, the Chief Justice can
			<lb />
			either proceed on the basis of affidavits and the
			<lb />
			documents produced or take such evidence or
			<lb />
			get such evidence recorded, as may be
			<lb />
			necessary. …

			22. Where the intervention of the court is
			<lb />
			sought for appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal
			<lb />
			under Section 11, the duty of the Chief Justice
			<lb />
			or his designate is defined in SBP &amp; Co. [(2005)
			<lb />
			8 SCC 618] This Court identified and
			<lb />
			segregated the preliminary issues that may
			<lb />
			arise for consideration in an application under
			<lb />
			Section 11 of the Act into three categories, that
			<lb />
			is, (i) issues which the Chief Justice or his
			<lb />
			designate is bound to decide; (ii) issues which
			<lb />
			he can also decide, that is, issues which he
			<lb />
			may choose to decide; and (iii) issues which
			<lb />
			should be left to the Arbitral Tribunal to
			<lb />
			decide.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			22.1. The issues (first category) which the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice/his designate will have to decide
			<lb />
			are:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) Whether the party making the application
			<lb />
			has approached the appropriate High Court.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) Whether there is an arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			and whether the party who has applied under
			<lb />
			Section 11 of the Act, is a party to such an
			<lb />
			agreement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			22.2. The issues (second category) which the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice/his designate may choose to
			<lb />
			decide (or leave them to the decision of the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal) are:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) Whether the claim is a dead (longbarred)
			<lb />
			claim or a live claim.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) Whether the parties have concluded the
			<lb />
			contract/transaction by recording satisfaction
			<lb />
			of their mutual rights and obligation or by
			<lb />
			receiving the final payment without objection.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			22.3. The issues (third category) which the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice/his designate should leave
			<lb />
			exclusively to the Arbitral Tribunal are:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) Whether a claim made falls within the
			<lb />
			arbitration clause (as for example, a matter
			<lb />
			which is reserved for final decision of a
			<lb />
			departmental authority and excepted or
			<lb />
			excluded from arbitration).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Merits or any claim involved in the
			<lb />
			arbitration.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			23. It is clear from the scheme of the Act as
			<lb />
			explained by this Court in SBP &amp; Co. [(2005) 8
			<lb />
			SCC 618] , that in regard to issues falling
			<lb />
			under the second category, if raised in any
			<lb />
			application under Section 11 of the Act, the
			<lb />
			Chief Justice/his designate may decide them,
			<lb />
			if necessary, by taking evidence. Alternatively,
			<lb />
			he may leave those issues open with a
			<lb />
			direction to the Arbitral Tribunal to decide the
			<lb />
			same. If the Chief Justice or his designate
			<lb />
			chooses to examine the issue and decides
			<lb />
			it, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot reexamine
			<lb />
			the same issue. The Chief Justice/his
			<lb />
			designate will, in choosing whether he will
			<lb />
			decide such issue or leave it to the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal, be guided by the object of the Act
			<lb />
			(that is expediting the arbitration process with
			<lb />
			minimum
			<lb />
			judicial
			<lb />
			intervention).
			<lb />
			Where
			<lb />
			allegations of forgery/fabrication are made in
			<lb />
			regard to the document recording discharge of
			<lb />
			contract by full and final settlement, it would
			<lb />
			be appropriate if the Chief Justice/his
			<lb />
			designate decides the issue.&quot;

			36. In Chloro Controls India Private Ltd. v. Severn Trent
			<lb />
			Water Purification Inc., (2013) 1 SCC 641, this Court had
			<lb />
			to expound the scope of Section 45 in a multiparty
			<lb />
			arbitration. The Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;84. The issue of whether the courts are
			<lb />
			empowered to review the existence and validity
			<lb />
			of the arbitration agreement prior to reference
			<lb />
			is more controversial. A majority of the
			<lb />
			countries admit to the positive effect of
			<lb />
			kompetenzkompetenz principle, which requires
			<lb />
			that the Arbitral Tribunal must exercise
			<lb />
			jurisdiction over the dispute under the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. Thus, challenge to the
			<lb />
			existence or validity of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement will not prevent the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal from proceeding with hearing and
			<lb />
			ruling upon its jurisdiction. If it retains
			<lb />
			jurisdiction, making of an award on the
			<lb />
			substance of the dispute would be permissible
			<lb />
			without waiting for the outcome of any court
			<lb />
			action aimed at deciding the issue of the
			<lb />
			jurisdiction. The negative effect of the
			<lb />
			kompetenzkompetenz
			<lb />
			principle
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			arbitrators are entitled to be the first to
			<lb />
			determine their jurisdiction which is later
			<lb />
			reviewable by the court, when there is action
			<lb />
			to enforce or set aside the arbitral award.
			<lb />
			Where the dispute is not before an Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal, the court must also decline
			<lb />
			jurisdiction
			<lb />
			unless
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement is patently void, inoperative or
			<lb />
			incapable of being performed.&quot;

			Chloro Controls Case (supra) and SBP Case (supra), which
			<lb />
			the Court formulated in the following manner:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;2. We have commenced our opinion with
			<lb />
			the aforesaid exposition of law as arguments
			<lb />
			have been canvassed by Mr Ranjit Kumar,
			<lb />
			learned Senior Counsel for the appellants,
			<lb />
			with innovative intellectual animation how a
			<lb />
			threeJudge Bench in Chloro Controls India
			<lb />
			(P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water Purification
			<lb />
			Inc., (2013) 1 SCC 641 has inappositely and
			<lb />
			incorrectly understood the principles stated
			<lb />
			in the major part of the decision rendered by
			<lb />
			a larger Bench in SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg.
			<lb />
			Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618 and, in resistance,
			<lb />
			Mr Harish Salve and Dr A.M. Singhvi,
			<lb />
			learned Senior Counsel for the respondent,
			<lb />
			while defending the view expressed later by
			<lb />
			the threeJudge Bench, have laid immense
			<lb />
			emphasis on consistency and certainty of
			<lb />
			law that garner public confidence, especially
			<lb />
			in the field of arbitration, regard being had to
			<lb />
			the globalisation of economy and stability of
			<lb />
			the jurisprudential concepts and pragmatic
			<lb />
			process of arbitration that sparkles the soul
			<lb />
			of commercial progress. We make it clear
			<lb />
			that we are not writing the grammar of
			<lb />
			arbitration but indubitably we intend, and
			<lb />
			we shall, in course of our delineation,
			<lb />
			endeavour to clear the maze, so that
			<lb />
			certainty remains &quot;A Definite&quot; and finality is
			<lb />
			&quot;Final&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The Court answering the question, answered thus:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;40. From the aforesaid authorities it is
			<lb />
			luculent that the larger Bench in SBP [SBP
			<lb />
			&amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC
			<lb />
			618] , after deliberating at length with
			<lb />
			regard to the role of the Chief Justice or his
			<lb />
			designate, while dealing with an application
			<lb />
			under Section 11(6) of the Act, has thought
			<lb />
			it appropriate to define what it precisely
			<lb />
			meant in para 39 of the judgment. The
			<lb />
			majority, if we allow ourselves to say so, was
			<lb />
			absolutely conscious that it required to be
			<lb />
			so stated and hence, it did so. The
			<lb />
			deliberation was required to be made as the
			<lb />
			decision
			<lb />
			in Konkan
			<lb />
			Railway
			<lb />
			Corpn.
			<lb />
			Ltd. v. Rani Construction (P) Ltd. [(2002) 2
			<lb />
			SCC 388] where the Constitution Bench had
			<lb />
			held that an order passed by the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice under Section 11(6) is an
			<lb />
			administrative order and not a judicial one
			<lb />
			and, in that context, the Bench in many a
			<lb />
			paragraph proceeded to state about the role
			<lb />
			of the Chief Justice or his designate. The
			<lb />
			phrases which have been emphasised by Mr
			<lb />
			Ranjit Kumar, it can be irrefragably stated,
			<lb />
			they cannot be brought to the eminence of
			<lb />
			ratio decidendi of the judgment. The stress
			<lb />
			laid thereon may be innovative but when the
			<lb />
			learned Judges themselves have culled out
			<lb />
			the ratio decidendi in para 39, it is
			<lb />
			extremely difficult to state that the principle
			<lb />
			stated in SBP [SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2005) 8 SCC 618] requires the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice or his designate to decide the
			<lb />
			controversy when raised pertaining to
			<lb />
			arbitrability of the disputes. Or to express
			<lb />
			an opinion on excepted matters. Such an
			<lb />
			inference by syllogistic process is likely to
			<lb />
			usher in catastrophe in jurisprudence
			<lb />
			developed in this field. We are disposed to
			<lb />
			think so as it is not apposite to pick up a
			<lb />
			line from here and there from the judgment
			<lb />
			or to choose one observation from here or
			<lb />
			there for raising it to the status of &quot;the ratio
			<lb />
			decidendi&quot;. That is most likely to pave one
			<lb />
			on the path of danger and it is to be
			<lb />
			scrupulously avoided. The propositions set
			<lb />
			out in SBP [SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2005) 8 SCC 618] , in our opinion, have
			<lb />
			been correctly understood by the twoJudge
			<lb />
			Bench in Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd. [National
			<lb />
			Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P)
			<lb />
			Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267] and the same have
			<lb />
			been appositely approved by the three
			<lb />
			Judge Bench in Chloro Controls India (P)
			<lb />
			Ltd. [Chloro Controls India (P) Ltd. v. Severn
			<lb />
			Trent Water Purification Inc., (2013) 1 SCC
			<lb />
			641] and we respectfully concur with the
			<lb />
			same. We find no substance in the
			<lb />
			submission that the said decisions require
			<lb />
			reconsideration, for certain observations
			<lb />
			made in SBP [SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2005) 8 SCC 618], were not noticed. We
			<lb />
			may hasten to add that the threeJudge
			<lb />
			Bench has been satisfied that the ratio
			<lb />
			decidendi of the judgment in SBP [SBP &amp;
			<lb />
			Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] is
			<lb />

		<p>
			38. This Court in Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port,
			<lb />
			(2017) 9 SCC 729, held as under:
			<lb />
			(Justice Banumathi)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;20…Since the dispute between the parties
			<lb />
			arose in 2016, the amended provision of
			<lb />
			subsection (6A) of Section 11 shall govern
			<lb />
			the issue, as per which the power of the
			<lb />
			Court is confined only to examine the
			<lb />
			existence of the arbitration agreement.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			(Justice Kurian Joseph)
			<lb />
			&quot;59. The scope of the power under Section
			<lb />
			11(6) of the 1996 Act was considerably wide
			<lb />
			in view of the decisions in SBP and Co. [SBP
			<lb />
			and Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC
			<lb />
			618]
			<lb />
			and Boghara
			<lb />
			Polyfab [National
			<lb />
			Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2009) 1 SCC 267]. This position continued
			<lb />
			till the amendment brought about in
			<lb />
			2015. After the amendment, all that the
			<lb />
			courts need to see is whether an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement exists-nothing
			<lb />
			more, nothing less. The legislative policy
			<lb />
			and purpose is essentially to minimize
			<lb />
			the Court&apos;s intervention at the stage of
			<lb />
			appointing the arbitrator and this
			<lb />
			intention as incorporated in Section 11(6
			<lb />
			A) ought to be respected.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			39. However, in Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Narbheram Power and Steel Private Limited, (&quot;Oriental
			<lb />
			Insurance&quot;) (2018) 6 SCC 534, a threeJudge Bench of this
			<lb />
			Court, following the decision in Vulcan Insurance v.
			<lb />
			Maharaj Singh, (1976) 1 SCC 943, dismissed an
			<lb />
			application under Section 11 of the Act after examining the
			<lb />
			arbitrability of the dispute. It may be noted that the Court
			<lb />
			did not answer the question as to the power of the Court
			<lb />
			under Section 11 of the Act in this case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			40. Similarly, in United India Insurance Company Limited v.
			<lb />
			Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company
			<lb />
			Limited, (&quot;Hyundai Engineering&quot;) (2018) 17 SCC 607, the
			<lb />
			Court examined the arbitrability of the dispute as well as
			<lb />
			whether the dispute fell within the ambit of an excepted
			<lb />
			matter by placing heavy reliance on the decision
			<lb />
			in Oriental Insurance (supra). These two cases are, by
			<lb />
			necessary, implication to be restricted to the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			41. Further, in United India Insurance Company Limited v.
			<lb />
			Antique Art Exports Private Limited (&quot;Antique Arts&quot;),
			<lb />
			(2019) 5 SCC 362, this Court, in a proceeding under Section
			<lb />
			11 of the Act, distinguished the holding in Duro
			<lb />
			Felguera (supra) on the grounds that the same was a mere
			<lb />
			general observation about the effect of the amended
			<lb />
			provisions and that the said decision was distinguishable on
			<lb />
			the facts of the case. The Court held that the power under
			<lb />
			Section 11 with the Chief Justice/ his designates is a
			<lb />
			judicial power and not an administrative function, therefore
			<lb />
			leaving some degree of judicial intervention. The Court went
			<lb />
			on to hold that when it comes to examining the prima facie
			<lb />
			existence of an arbitration agreement, it is always necessary
			<lb />
			to ensure that the dispute resolution process does not
			<lb />
			become unnecessarily protracted. On this basis, the Court,
			<lb />
			in a proceeding under Section 11 of the Act, analyzed the
			<lb />
			effect of the execution of a discharge voucher and the
			<lb />
			settlement of the claim by accord and satisfaction. On
			<lb />
			finding the claim to have been settled by accord and
			<lb />
			satisfaction, the Court held that there was no dispute under
			<lb />
			the agreement to be referred to an arbitrator for
			<lb />
			adjudication.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			42. In Mayavati Trading Pvt. Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman,
			<lb />
			(2019) 8 SCC 714, a Bench of three Judges, while overruling
			<lb />
			the Antique Arts Case (supra), held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;10. This being the position, it is clear that
			<lb />
			the law prior to the 2015 Amendment that
			<lb />
			has been laid down by this Court, which
			<lb />
			would have included going into whether
			<lb />
			accord and satisfaction has taken place, has
			<lb />
			now been legislatively overruled. This being
			<lb />
			the position, it is difficult to agree with the
			<lb />
			reasoning contained in the aforesaid
			<lb />
			judgment [United India Insurance Co.
			<lb />
			Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd., (2019) 5
			<lb />
			SCC 362] , as Section 11(6A) is confined to
			<lb />
			the examination of the existence of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement and is to be
			<lb />
			understood in the narrow sense as has been
			<lb />
			laid down in the judgment in Duro Felguera,
			<lb />
			SA [Duro Felguera, SA v. Gangavaram Port
			<lb />
			Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729] -see paras 48 &amp; 59
			<lb />
			[Ed.: The said paras 48 &amp; 59 of Duro
			<lb />
			Felguera, SA v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017)
			<lb />
			9 SCC 729, for ready reference, read as
			<lb />
			follows:&quot;48. Section 11(6A) added by the
			<lb />
			2015 Amendment, reads as follows:
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;11. (6
			<lb />
			A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may
			<lb />
			be, the High Court, while considering any
			<lb />
			application under subsection (4) or sub
			<lb />
			section
			<lb />
			(5)
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			subsection
			<lb />
			(6),
			<lb />
			shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree
			<lb />
			or order of any court, confine to the
			<lb />
			examination of the existence of an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement.&quot;(emphasis
			<lb />
			supplied)From
			<lb />
			a
			<lb />
			reading of Section 11(6A), the intention of
			<lb />
			the legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court
			<lb />
			should and need only look into one aspect-
			<lb />
			the existence of an arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
			What are the factors for deciding as to
			<lb />
			whether there is an arbitration agreement is
			<lb />
			the next question. The resolution to that is
			<lb />
			simple-it needs to be seen if the agreement
			<lb />
			contains a clause which provides for
			<lb />
			arbitration pertaining to the disputes which
			<lb />
			have arisen between the parties to the
			<lb />
			agreement.***59. The scope of the power
			<lb />
			under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was
			<lb />
			considerably wide in view of the decisions
			<lb />
			in SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC
			<lb />
			618
			<lb />
			and National
			<lb />
			Insurance
			<lb />
			Co.
			<lb />
			Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC
			<lb />
			267. This position continued till the
			<lb />
			amendment brought about in 2015. After the
			<lb />
			amendment, all that the courts need to see is
			<lb />
			whether an arbitration agreement exists-
			<lb />
			nothing more, nothing less. The legislative
			<lb />
			policy and purpose is essentially to minimise
			<lb />
			the Court&apos;s intervention at the stage of
			<lb />
			appointing the arbitrator and this intention
			<lb />
			as incorporated in Section 11(6A) ought to
			<lb />
			be respected.&quot;].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			11. We, therefore, overrule the judgment
			<lb />
			in Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd. [United India
			<lb />
			Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P)
			<lb />
			Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 362] as not having laid
			<lb />
			down the correct law but dismiss this appeal
			<lb />
			for the reason given in para 3 above.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			43. From the study of the precedents, the following
			<lb />
			propositions, concerning Section 11 of the Act, are clear and
			<lb />
			binding:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			1. Reference power under Section 11 of the Act is
			<lb />
			judicial and not administrative.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			2. There was a wide discretion for judicial interference
			<lb />
			at the stage of reference under Section 11 of the Act,
			<lb />
			prior to the Arbitration Amendment Act of 2015.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3. Amendment in 2015 was brought into force to limit
			<lb />
			the power of judicial interference under Section 11 of
			<lb />
			the Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			44. Having observed the precedents holding the field in respect
			<lb />
			of Section 11, we now come to an analysis of Section 8.
			<lb />
			Section 8 of the Act applies, when a matter is brought by
			<lb />
			one of the parties before the Court, and the other party
			<lb />
			brings to the notice of the Court of existence of such
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. Under these circumstances, the
			<lb />
			Court is obligated to refer a matter to arbitration, on
			<lb />
			satisfaction that a valid arbitration agreement exists
			<lb />
			between the parties. The 2015 amendment clarified that the
			<lb />
			test to be utilized by the Court is on a prima facie basis.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			45. The primary reason for the same, is the negative effect of
			<lb />
			Kompetenz Kompetenz under Section 16, which mandates
			<lb />
			that the arbitral tribunal is required to first look into any
			<lb />
			objections as to the jurisdiction of the tribunal itself. It is
			<lb />
			due to the fact that parties may abuse and protract the
			<lb />
			proceedings if there is no gatekeeping mechanism, that the
			<lb />
			legislature has found a balance, wherein the Court is
			<lb />
			required to examine the validity of an arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			on a prima facie basis.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			46. In this context, we need to examine the meaning of &apos;validity
			<lb />
			of arbitration agreement&apos; as occurring under Section 8 of the
			<lb />
			Act. There is no doubt that &apos;validity&apos; to be examined under
			<lb />
			Section 8(2) of the Act, could be interpreted to mean formal
			<lb />
			validity as expressed under Section 7 of the Act. Such an
			<lb />
			interpretation would operate as a full application of the
			<lb />
			negative facet of Section 16, as the jurisdiction of the Court
			<lb />
			to stepin at the reference stage would be limited. However,
			<lb />
			the burden of the precedents stops us from accepting such
			<lb />
			a narrow interpretation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			47. This brings us to the issue whether the issue of
			<lb />
			&apos;arbitrability&apos; can be analyzed by the Courts under Section 8
			<lb />
			or 11 of the Act?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			48. There is no doubt that &apos;arbitrability&apos; has acquired various
			<lb />
			meaning around the world. In this context, this Court is
			<lb />
			required to first identify the various meaning for the
			<lb />
			aforesaid term, in order to recognize its meaning in the
			<lb />
			Indian context. Outside the United States of America, the
			<lb />
			term &quot;arbitrability&quot; has a reasonably precise and limited
			<lb />
			meaning, relating to whether specific classes of disputes are
			<lb />
			barred from arbitration because of national legislation or
			<lb />
			judicial authority. In the United States of America,
			<lb />
			arbitrability also refers to the complicated balance between
			<lb />
			courts and arbitrators regarding who should be the initial
			<lb />
			decisionmaker on issues such as the validity of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. Out of the two meanings, we
			<lb />
			subscribe to the international flavor, which is one of the
			<lb />
			cherished legislative intentions, i.e., to bring the arbitration
			<lb />
			act in tune with the global march. Having ascertained the
			<lb />
			meaning of arbitrability, we need to analyze whether
			<lb />
			arbitrability could be determined by the Court at the
			<lb />
			reference stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			49. No doubt, arbitrability finds a close nexus with the validity
			<lb />
			of the arbitration agreement, yet we need to observe the
			<lb />
			unique nature of the arbitration agreement, which is a
			<lb />
			bundle of contractual and jurisdictional elements. Even if a
			<lb />
			Tribunal comes to an understanding that there exists a
			<lb />
			valid arbitration agreement, still it does not mean that
			<lb />
			certain subject matters are arbitrable per se. This
			<lb />
			distinction is required to be kept in mind.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			50. Section 34 (2)(b) provides the statutory basis for objecting
			<lb />
			that an award which may not be capable of being settled by
			<lb />
			arbitration, or is against the public policy of India. The
			<lb />
			legislative intention of not arbitrating issues of public policy
			<lb />
			are intertwined with the fact that monopolies of the State
			<lb />
			activities should not be subject matter of a private tribunal,
			<lb />
			as the concerns of the State cannot not be dealt effectively.
			<lb />
			Further, an award, which has an erga omnes effect on third
			<lb />
			parties, would not be in tune with the contractual nature of
			<lb />
			arbitration, which is binding on the consenting parties
			<lb />
			alone. However, this feature alone, does not explicitly
			<lb />
			mandate that the tribunal cannot first adjudicate a claim
			<lb />
			based on the public policy argument.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51. It is to be noted that whether a subject matter can or cannot
			<lb />
			be arbitrated should necessarily be dealt on a case to case
			<lb />
			basis, rather than a having a bold exposition that certain
			<lb />
			subject matters are incapable of arbitration. This case is one
			<lb />
			such example of overbroad ratio, expounded by this Court
			<lb />
			by laying that certain subject areas cannot be arbitrated per
			<lb />
			se. At this juncture, we may observe the case of The
			<lb />
			London
			<lb />
			Steamship
			<lb />
			Owners&apos;
			<lb />
			Mutual
			<lb />
			Insurance
			<lb />
			Association Ltd v The Kingdom of Spain and The
			<lb />
			French State, [2015] EWCA Civ 333. The case relates to an
			<lb />
			oil spill off the coast of Spain and France from a vessel
			<lb />
			named &apos;The Prestige&apos;, which resulted in the Government of
			<lb />
			Spain and France taking action against the Captain of the
			<lb />
			ship and other officers under the Spanish Criminal Code, as
			<lb />
			well as instituting a case against the Owner to pay punitive
			<lb />
			damages under the Spanish Penal Code. It may be noted
			<lb />
			that the claim was also brought against the insurer of the
			<lb />
			ship for indemnity. Those claims were based both on the
			<lb />
			insurer&apos;s obligation to indemnify the owners against their
			<lb />
			obligations under the International Convention on Civil
			<lb />
			Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and on its obligation to
			<lb />
			indemnify them against their independent liability for the
			<lb />
			tortious acts of the master, chief officer and chief engineer.
			<lb />
			The insurers took preemptive action by commencing
			<lb />
			arbitral proceedings for declaratory relief: a declaration that
			<lb />
			France and Spain were bound by the arbitration clause
			<lb />
			provided in the insurers&apos; rules and that the insurers were
			<lb />
			not liable under the underlying contract. The relief sought
			<lb />
			was granted in favour of the insurers in the form of arbitral
			<lb />
			awards. The insurers attempted to enforce the arbitral
			<lb />
			awards in England before the judgment was rendered in the
			<lb />
			Spanish legal proceedings. France and Spain opposed this
			<lb />
			enforcement of the arbitral awards on various grounds. One
			<lb />
			such reason, which was raised on behalf of Spain, was that
			<lb />
			the matter was incapable of being resolved by arbitration.
			<lb />
			The Court while dismissing the aforesaid objection, held
			<lb />
			that:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			In my view this passage amounts to a
			<lb />
			finding that a conviction is not an
			<lb />
			integral element of the cause of action.
			<lb />
			The distinction is important, because
			<lb />
			even if a conviction were a precondition
			<lb />
			to the right to recover against the insurer,
			<lb />
			there would be no reason why an
			<lb />
			arbitrator should not determine a claim
			<lb />
			of this kind, taking into account whether
			<lb />
			the condition has or has not been
			<lb />
			satisfied. He cannot, on the other hand,
			<lb />
			formally convict any person of a criminal
			<lb />
			offence.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<p>
			This Court does recognize the jurisdictional differences and
			<lb />
			uniqueness between England and India, while placing
			<lb />
			reliance on the same. However, the important aspect is that
			<lb />
			the plea of public policy is required to be specifically
			<lb />
			identified, pleaded and shown with respect to how the
			<lb />
			award is contrary to the public policy. It may be possible
			<lb />
			that there may be certain claims abutting a restricted
			<lb />
			sphere, which may not be specifically hit by public policy or
			<lb />
			have erga omnes effect. If that be so, it would be too early at
			<lb />
			the stage of reference to determine the same as it would
			<lb />
			require complete examination of the issue at hand, which is
			<lb />
			more suited to be first dealt by the Tribunal and thereafter
			<lb />
			be looked into at the stage of enforcement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			52. To this extent, even this Court in Avitel Post Studioz
			<lb />
			Limited v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited, Civil
			<lb />
			Appeal No. 5145 of 2016 has held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;16.
			<lb />
			In the light of the aforesaid
			<lb />
			judgments, paragraph 27(vi) of Afcons
			<lb />
			[Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. v. Cherian Varkey
			<lb />
			Construction Co. (P) Ltd., (2010) 8 SCC 24]
			<lb />
			and paragraph 36(i) of Booz Allen [Booz Allen
			<lb />
			&amp; Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2011)5 SCC 532, must now be read subject
			<lb />
			to the rider that the same set of facts may
			<lb />
			lead to civil andcriminal proceedings and if it
			<lb />
			is clear that a civil dispute involvesquestions
			<lb />
			of fraud, misrepresentation, etc. which can
			<lb />
			be the subject matter of such proceeding
			<lb />
			under section 17 of the Contract Act,
			<lb />
			and/orthe tort of deceit, the mere fact that
			<lb />
			criminal proceedings can or have been
			<lb />
			instituted in respect of the same subject
			<lb />
			matter would not lead to the conclusion that
			<lb />
			a dispute which is otherwise arbitrable,
			<lb />
			ceases to be so.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			53. It is important to note that various countries have already
			<lb />
			allowed interpartes arbitration with respect to in rem rights
			<lb />
			concerning intellectual property etc., through a statutory
			<lb />
			framework. It is worthwhile to study the feasibility of the
			<lb />
			same, if we want to provide impetus to arbitration.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			54. On a different note, we need to keep in mind that an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement would, as a necessary implication,
			<lb />
			carry with it a presumption of a onestop mechanism. When
			<lb />
			parties decide to enter into an arbitration agreement, they
			<lb />
			agree to take all their disputes before arbitration. This
			<lb />
			presumption, is a rebuttable presumption. Therefore,
			<lb />
			Section 8 and 11 has to be interpreted with sufficient
			<lb />
			strictness, wherein the jurisdiction of the Court to decide
			<lb />
			issues should be limited to those expressly provided by the
			<lb />
			law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			55. This Court has dealt with various judgments on the issue of
			<lb />
			arbitrability, which are required to be discussed at this
			<lb />
			point. The first case is of Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. v.
			<lb />
			SBI Home Finance Ltd., (2011) 5 SCC 532, wherein a
			<lb />
			Division Bench dealt with the ambit of Section 8 and 11
			<lb />
			(prior to amendment), qua subject matter arbitrability. This
			<lb />
			Court observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;32. The nature and scope of issues
			<lb />
			arising for consideration in an application
			<lb />
			under Section 11 of the Act for
			<lb />
			appointment of arbitrators, are far
			<lb />
			narrower than those arising in an
			<lb />
			application under Section 8 of the Act,
			<lb />
			seeking reference of the parties to a suit
			<lb />
			to arbitration. While considering an
			<lb />
			application under Section 11 of the Act,
			<lb />
			the Chief Justice or his designate would
			<lb />
			not embark upon an examination of the
			<lb />
			issue of &quot;arbitrability&quot; or appropriateness
			<lb />
			of adjudication by a private forum, once
			<lb />
			he finds that there was an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement between or among the parties,
			<lb />
			and would leave the issue of arbitrability
			<lb />
			for the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. If
			<lb />
			the arbitrator wrongly holds that the
			<lb />
			dispute is arbitrable, the aggrieved party
			<lb />
			will have to challenge the award by filing
			<lb />
			an application under Section 34 of the
			<lb />
			Act, relying upon subsection (2)(b)(i) of
			<lb />
			that section.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The Court was cognizant of the fact that prior to the 2015
			<lb />
			amendment, Section 11 posits a limited jurisdiction for the
			<lb />
			Courts to deal with, in comparison to Section 8, which occurs at
			<lb />
			a different stage. In this context, it is relevant to quote
			<lb />
			paragraphs 33 and 36, which reads as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			33. But where the issue of &quot;arbitrability&quot;
			<lb />
			arises in the context of an application
			<lb />
			under Section 8 of the Act in a pending
			<lb />
			suit, all aspects of arbitrability will have
			<lb />
			to be decided by the court seized of the
			<lb />
			suit, and cannot be left to the decision of
			<lb />
			the arbitrator. Even if there is an
			<lb />
			arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement
			<lb />
			between
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			parties, and even if the dispute is covered
			<lb />
			by the arbitration agreement, the court
			<lb />
			where the civil suit is pending, will refuse
			<lb />
			an application under Section 8 of the Act,
			<lb />
			to refer the parties to arbitration, if the
			<lb />
			subjectmatter of the suit is capable of
			<lb />
			adjudication only by a public forum or
			<lb />
			the relief claimed can only be granted by
			<lb />
			a special court or Tribunal.

			36. The wellrecognised examples of non
			<lb />
			arbitrable disputes are: (i) disputes
			<lb />
			relating to rights and liabilities which give
			<lb />
			rise to or arise out of criminal offences;
			<lb />
			(ii) matrimonial disputes relating to
			<lb />
			divorce, judicial separation, restitution of
			<lb />
			conjugal rights, child custody; (iii)
			<lb />
			guardianship matters; (iv) insolvency and
			<lb />
			windingup matters; (v) testamentary
			<lb />
			matters (grant of probate, letters of
			<lb />
			administration
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			succession
			<lb />
			certificate); and (vi) eviction or tenancy
			<lb />
			matters governed by special statutes
			<lb />
			where the tenant enjoys statutory
			<lb />
			protection against eviction and only the
			<lb />
			specified courts are conferred jurisdiction
			<lb />
			to grant eviction or decide the disputes.
			<lb />
			The Court came to the aforesaid conclusion, of ascertaining
			<lb />
			certain subject matters as nonarbitrable, on two main
			<lb />
			reasons, (1.) that certain matters are excluded for
			<lb />
			examination by a private forum; (2) that in rem rights
			<lb />
			cannot be arbitrated.

			56. In A. Ayysamy v. A. Paramsivam, (2016) 10 SCC 386, this
			<lb />
			Court had to deal with an issue concerning the arbitrability
			<lb />
			of fraud under the Act, prior to the 2015 amendment. The
			<lb />
			Court by two separate opinions delivered by Justice A. K.
			<lb />
			Sikri and Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, has recognized that the
			<lb />
			Court at the reference stage, could classify a matter and
			<lb />
			accordingly refer a matter to arbitration which does not
			<lb />
			have serious allegations of fraud.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			57. In Emaar MGF Land Limited v. Aftab Singh, (2019) 12
			<lb />
			SCC 751, this Court held that Consumer Protection Act
			<lb />
			cases are not arbitrable. On a perusal of the judgment, no
			<lb />
			doubt reliance was placed on the Booz Allen Case (supra)
			<lb />
			and there is some discussion on the scope of Section 8 of
			<lb />
			the Arbitration Act. However, the thrust of the reasoning is
			<lb />
			not on the question of arbitrability, rather it was on the fact
			<lb />
			that the Consumer Protection Act, had an implied bar for
			<lb />
			referring a matter to arbitration, being a special legislation.
			<lb />
			The difference is subtle, yet it is required to be recognized
			<lb />
			that the Consumer Protection Act, impliedly barred the
			<lb />
			application of the Arbitration Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			58. From a study of the above precedents, the following
			<lb />
			conclusion, with respect to adjudication of subjectmatter
			<lb />
			arbitrability under Section 8 or 11 of the Act, are pertinent:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			a) In line with the categories laid down by the earlier
			<lb />
			judgment of Boghara Polyfab (supra), the Courts
			<lb />
			were examining &apos;subjectmatter arbitrability&apos; at
			<lb />
			the prearbitral stage, prior to the 2015
			<lb />
			amendment.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			b) Post the 2015 amendment, judicial interference
			<lb />
			at the reference stage has been substantially
			<lb />
			curtailed.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			c) Although subject matter arbitrability and public
			<lb />
			policy objections are provided separately under
			<lb />
			Section 34 of the Act, the Courts herein have
			<lb />
			understood the same to be interchangeable under
			<lb />
			the Act. Further, subject matter arbitrability is
			<lb />
			interlinked with inrem rights.
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			d) There are special classes of rights and privileges,
			<lb />
			which enure to the benefit of a citizen, by virtue
			<lb />
			of constitutional or legislative instrument, which
			<lb />
			may affect the arbitrability of a subject matter.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			59. It may be noted that the Act itself does not exclude any
			<lb />
			category of disputes as being nonarbitrable. However, the
			<lb />
			Courts have used the &apos;public policy&apos; reason to restrict
			<lb />
			arbitration with respect to certain subject matters. In line
			<lb />
			with the aforesaid proposition, the Courts have interfered
			<lb />
			with the subject matter arbitrability at the prereference
			<lb />
			stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			60. However, post the 2015 amendment, the structure of the
			<lb />
			Act was changed to bring it in tune with the proarbitration
			<lb />
			approach. Under the amended provision, the Court can only
			<lb />
			give prima facie opinion on the existence of a valid
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. In line with the amended language
			<lb />
			and the statutory scheme, the examination of the subject
			<lb />
			matter arbitrability may not be appropriate at the stage of
			<lb />
			reference under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act. It is more
			<lb />
			appropriate to be taken up by the Court at the stage of
			<lb />
			enforcement under Section 34 of the Act. Having said so, in
			<lb />
			clear cases where the subject matter arbitrability is clearly
			<lb />
			barred, the Court can cut the deadwood to preserve the
			<lb />
			efficacy of the arbitral process.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			61. At this stage a word of caution needs to be said for
			<lb />
			arbitrators. They have been given jurisdiction to decide on
			<lb />
			the subject matter arbitrability. They are required to identify
			<lb />
			specific public policy in order to determine the subject
			<lb />
			matter arbitrability. Merely because a matter verges on a
			<lb />
			prohibited territory, should not by in itself stop the
			<lb />
			arbitrator from deciding the matter. He/she should be
			<lb />
			careful in considering the question of nonarbitrability.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			62. This brings us to the question of what prima facie case
			<lb />
			means, as is required to determine the nonexistence of a
			<lb />
			valid arbitration agreement under Section 8 of the Act. The
			<lb />
			meaning and scope of &apos;prima facie&apos; has greatly varied in
			<lb />
			common law as well as the civil law systems. Immediately,
			<lb />
			at least two meanings can be attributed to this term. First,
			<lb />
			it means a party is said to have established a prima facie
			<lb />
			case when he has satisfied his burden of producing
			<lb />
			evidence. The second meaning postulates that a party has
			<lb />
			established a prima facie case only when he has made such
			<lb />
			a strong showing that he is entitled to a presumption in his
			<lb />
			favor. ShinEtsu Case (supra), categorically laid that prima
			<lb />
			facie test is to be adopted under Section 45 of the Act (prior
			<lb />
			to the 2015 amendment). The Court was of the opinion that
			<lb />
			prima facie determination was seen as the view of Court,
			<lb />
			which can again be gone into by the Tribunal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			63. In Antique Arts (supra) (subsequently overruled on a
			<lb />
			different point), this Court while following New India
			<lb />
			Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Genus Power Infrastructure Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2015) 2 SCC 424 held that that a bald plea of fraud,
			<lb />
			coercion, duress or undue influence is not enough and the
			<lb />
			party who sets up a plea, must establish the same on a
			<lb />
			prima facie basis by placing material before the Chief
			<lb />
			Justice/his designate. This categorically establishes that
			<lb />
			prima facie case is relatable to establishment of initial
			<lb />
			presumption, rather than an evidentiary standard.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			64. The 246 th Law Commission Report, in respect of scope and
			<lb />
			nature of prearbitral judicial intervention, states as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;28. The Act recognizes situations where
			<lb />
			the intervention of the Court is envisaged
			<lb />
			at the prearbitral stage i.e. prior to the
			<lb />
			constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal,
			<lb />
			which includes Sections 8, 9, 11 in the
			<lb />
			case of Part I arbitrations and Section 45
			<lb />
			in the case of Part II arbitrations.
			<lb />
			Sections 8, 45 and also Section 11
			<lb />
			relating to &quot;reference to arbitration&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;appointment of the Tribunal&quot;, directly
			<lb />
			affect the constitution of the Tribunal and
			<lb />
			functioning of the arbitral proceedings.
			<lb />
			Therefore, their operation has a direct
			<lb />
			and significant impact on the &quot;conduct&quot;
			<lb />
			of arbitrations. Section 9, being solely for
			<lb />
			the purpose of securing interim relief,
			<lb />
			although having the potential to affect the
			<lb />
			rights of parties, does not affect the
			<lb />
			&quot;conduct&quot; of the arbitration in the same
			<lb />
			way as these other provisions. It is in this
			<lb />
			context the Commission has examined
			<lb />
			and deliberated the working of these
			<lb />
			provisions
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			proposed
			<lb />
			certain
			<lb />
			amendments.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			29. The Supreme Court has had occasion
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			deliberate
			<lb />
			upon
			<lb />
			the scope and nature of permissible pre
			<lb />
			arbitral judicial intervention, especially in
			<lb />
			the context of Section 11 of the Act.
			<lb />
			Unfortunately, however, the question
			<lb />
			before the Supreme Court was framed in
			<lb />
			terms of whether such a power is a
			<lb />
			&quot;judicial&quot; or an &quot;administrative&quot; power -
			<lb />
			which
			<lb />
			obfuscates
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			real
			<lb />
			issue
			<lb />
			underlying
			<lb />
			such
			<lb />
			nomenclature/description as to-
			<lb />
			-the scope of such powers -i.e. the
			<lb />
			scope of arguments which a court (Chief
			<lb />
			Justice) will consider while deciding
			<lb />
			whether to appoint an arbitrator or not -
			<lb />
			i.e. whether the arbitration agreement
			<lb />
			exists, whether it is null and void,
			<lb />
			whether it is voidable, etc.; and which of
			<lb />
			these it should leave for decision of the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal.
			<lb />
			-the nature of such intervention -i.e.
			<lb />
			would the court (Chief Justice) consider
			<lb />
			the issues upon a detailed trial and
			<lb />
			whether the same would be decided
			<lb />
			finally or be left for determination of the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal.

			30. After a series of cases culminating in
			<lb />
			the decision in SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg.
			<lb />
			Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618 , the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held that the power to appoint an
			<lb />
			arbitrator under Section 11 is a &quot;judicial&quot;
			<lb />
			power. The underlying issues in this
			<lb />
			judgment, relating to the scope of
			<lb />
			intervention, were subsequently clarified
			<lb />
			by Raveendran, J. in National Insurance
			<lb />
			Co. Ltd. V. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd.,
			<lb />
			(2009) 1 SCC 267,

		<item>
			32. In relation to the nature of
			<lb />
			intervention, the exposition of the law is
			<lb />
			to be found in the decision of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in ShinEtsu Chemical Co.
			<lb />
			Ltd. V. Aksh Optifibre Ltd., (2005) 7 SCC
			<lb />
			234] , (in the context of Section 45 of the
			<lb />
			Act), where the Supreme Court has ruled
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			favour
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			looking
			<lb />
			at
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			issues/controversy only prima facie.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			33. It is in this context, the
			<lb />
			Commission
			<lb />
			has
			<lb />
			recommended
			<lb />
			amendments to Sections 8 and 11 of
			<lb />
			the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
			<lb />
			1996. The scope of the judicial
			<lb />
			intervention is only restricted to
			<lb />
			situations where the court/judicial
			<lb />
			authority finds that the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement does not exist or is null and
			<lb />
			void. Insofar as the nature of
			<lb />
			intervention is concerned, it is
			<lb />
			recommended that in the event the
			<lb />
			court/judicial authority is prima facie
			<lb />
			satisfied
			<lb />
			against
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			argument
			<lb />
			challenging the arbitration agreement,
			<lb />
			it shall appoint the arbitrator and/or
			<lb />
			refer the parties to arbitration, as the
			<lb />
			case
			<lb />
			may
			<lb />
			be.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			amendment
			<lb />
			envisages that the judicial authority
			<lb />
			shall not refer the parties to
			<lb />
			arbitration only if it finds that there
			<lb />
			does
			<lb />
			not
			<lb />
			exist
			<lb />
			an
			<lb />
			arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement or that it is null and void. If
			<lb />
			the judicial authority is of the opinion
			<lb />
			that prima facie the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement exists, then it shall refer
			<lb />
			the dispute to arbitration, and leave
			<lb />
			the existence of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement to be finally determined by
			<lb />
			the Arbitral Tribunal. However, if the
			<lb />
			judicial authority concludes that the
			<lb />
			agreement does not exist, then the
			<lb />
			conclusion will be final and not prima
			<lb />
			facie. The amendment also envisages
			<lb />
			that there shall be a conclusive
			<lb />
			determination as to whether the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement is null and void.
			<lb />
			In the event that the judicial authority
			<lb />
			refers the dispute to arbitration and/or
			<lb />
			appoints an arbitrator, under Sections
			<lb />
			8 and 11 respectively, such a decision
			<lb />
			will be final and nonappealable. An
			<lb />
			appeal can be maintained under
			<lb />
			Section 37 only in the event of refusal
			<lb />
			to refer parties to arbitration, or
			<lb />
			refusal to appoint an arbitrator.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			65. The difference of statutory language provided under the
			<lb />
			amended Section 8, which states &apos;refer the parties to
			<lb />
			arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement exists&apos; in comparison with the amended Section
			<lb />
			11(6A), creates disparities which need to be ironed out.
			<lb />
			While the Court in the ShinEtsu case (supra) and the
			<lb />
			Duro Felguera case (supra) recommended for finding a
			<lb />
			valid arbitration agreement on a prima facie basis qua
			<lb />
			Section 11, however, the negative language used under the
			<lb />
			amended Section 8 mandates for referring a matter to
			<lb />
			arbitration unless the Court prima facie finds that no valid
			<lb />
			arbitration exists. It is to be noted that a finding of non
			<lb />
			existence of arbitration agreement is final subject to the
			<lb />
			appeal process only, without further scope for arbitration
			<lb />
			tribunal to decide anything as there can be no further
			<lb />
			reference. If that be the case, then the usage of phrase
			<lb />
			&apos;prima facie&apos; stands at odds with the established precedents
			<lb />
			on prima facie standards. In this context, we can only stress
			<lb />
			on the requirement of quality legislative drafting protocols to
			<lb />
			eliminate such complications.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			66. From the aforesaid discussion, we can conclude that the
			<lb />
			respondent/defendant has to establish a prima facie case of
			<lb />
			nonexistence of valid arbitration agreement, wherein it is to
			<lb />
			be summarily portrayed that a party is entitled to such a
			<lb />
			finding. If a party cannot satisfy the Court of the same on
			<lb />
			the basis of documents produced, and rather requires
			<lb />
			extensive examination of oral and documentary production,
			<lb />
			then the matter has to be necessarily referred to the
			<lb />
			Tribunal for full trial. Such limited jurisdiction vested with
			<lb />
			the Court, is necessary at the prereference stage to
			<lb />
			appropriately balance the power of the Tribunal with
			<lb />
			judicial interference.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			67. The amendment to the aforesaid provision was meant to cut
			<lb />
			the dead wood in extremely limited circumstances, wherein
			<lb />
			the respondent is able to exfacie portray nonexistence of
			<lb />
			valid arbitration agreement, on the documents and the
			<lb />
			pleadings produced by the parties. The prima facie view,
			<lb />
			which started its existence under Section 45 through Shin
			<lb />
			Etsu Case (supra), has been explicitly accommodated even
			<lb />
			under domestic arbitration by the 2015 amendment with
			<lb />
			appropriate modifications.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			68. Before we part with this aspect, it was extensively argued
			<lb />
			before us that the test for the Court is to see whether a
			<lb />
			party is able to establish a &apos;good arguable case&apos; for
			<lb />
			establishing the existence of the arbitration agreement.
			<lb />
			However, the statutory language under Sections 8 and 11
			<lb />
			emphasizes on the threshold requirement for a party for
			<lb />
			establishing the opposite. No doubt, the aforesaid approach
			<lb />
			may have merits. However, if the &apos;good arguable case
			<lb />
			standard&apos; is integrated for a party requiring to show non
			<lb />
			existence, then the same would amount to judicial activism.
			<lb />
			Such attempts to integrate alien formulations into the Act,
			<lb />
			which has already suffered sufficient judicial subjectivism,
			<lb />
			needs to be dissuaded.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			69. Having established the threshold standard for the Court to
			<lb />
			examine the extent of validity of the arbitration agreement,
			<lb />
			as a starting point, it is necessary to go back to Duro
			<lb />
			Felguera (supra), which laid down:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;48…..From a reading of Section 11(6A),
			<lb />
			the intention of the legislature is crystal
			<lb />
			clear i.e. the court should and need only
			<lb />
			look into one aspect-the existence of an
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement. What are the
			<lb />
			factors for deciding as to whether there is
			<lb />
			an arbitration agreement is the next
			<lb />
			question. The resolution to that is simple
			<lb />
			-it needs to be seen if the agreement
			<lb />
			contains a clause which provides for
			<lb />
			arbitration pertaining to the disputes
			<lb />
			which have arisen between the parties to
			<lb />
			the agreement.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			At first blush, the Court seems to have read the existence of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement by limiting the examination to an
			<lb />
			examination of its factual existence. However, that is not so,
			<lb />
			as the existence of arbitration agreement does not mean
			<lb />
			anything unless such agreement is contractually valid. This
			<lb />
			view is confirmed by the Duro Felguera case (supra),
			<lb />
			wherein the reference to the contractual aspect of
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement is ingrained under the Section 7
			<lb />
			analysis. A mere agreement is not legally binding, unless it
			<lb />
			satisfies the core contractual requirements, concerning
			<lb />
			consent, consideration, legal relationship, etc. In Mayavati
			<lb />
			Trading Case (supra) and Garware Wall Ropes Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Coastal Marine Construction and Engineering Ltd.,
			<lb />
			[2019] 9 SCC 209, the aforesaid stand has been confirmed.
			<lb />
			Therefore, the scope of the Court to examine the prima facie
			<lb />
			validity of an arbitration agreement includes only the
			<lb />
			determination of the following:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			92. Whether the arbitration agreement was in writing? or
			<lb />
			93. Whether the arbitration agreement was contained in
			<lb />
			exchange of letters, telecommunication, etc?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			94. Whether the core contractual ingredients qua the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement were fulfilled?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			95. On rare occasions, whether the subjectmatter of
			<lb />
			dispute is arbitrable?
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			At the cost of repetition, we note that Section 8 of the Act
			<lb />
			mandates that a matter should not be referred to an
			<lb />
			arbitration by a court of law unless it finds that prima facie
			<lb />
			there is no valid arbitration agreement. The negative
			<lb />
			language used in the Section is required to be taken into
			<lb />
			consideration, while analyzing the Section. The Court
			<lb />
			should refer a matter if the validity of the arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement cannot be determined on a prima facie basis, as
			<lb />
			laid down above. Therefore, the rule for the Court is &apos;when
			<lb />
			in doubt, do refer&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			70. Moreover, the amendment to Section 8 now rectifies the
			<lb />
			shortcomings pointed out in the Chloro Control Case
			<lb />
			(supra) with respect to domestic arbitration. Jurisdictional
			<lb />
			issues concerning whether certain parties are bound by a
			<lb />
			particular arbitration, under groupcompany doctrine or
			<lb />
			good faith, etc., in a multiparty arbitration raises
			<lb />
			complicated factual questions, which are best left for the
			<lb />
			tribunal to handle. The amendment to Section 8 on this
			<lb />
			front also indicates the legislative intention to further
			<lb />
			reduce the judicial interference at the stage of reference.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			71. Courts, while analyzing a case under Section 8, may choose
			<lb />
			to identify the issues which require adjudication pertaining
			<lb />
			to the validity of the arbitration agreement. If the Court
			<lb />
			cannot rule on the invalidity of the arbitration agreement on
			<lb />
			a prima facie basis, then the Court should stop any further
			<lb />
			analysis and simply refer all the issues to arbitration to be
			<lb />
			settled.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			72. Coming to the scope of judicial interference under Section
			<lb />
			11, the 246 th Law Commission Report noted that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;31. The Commission is of the view that,
			<lb />
			in this context, the same test regarding
			<lb />
			scope and nature of judicial intervention,
			<lb />
			as applicable in the context of Section 11,
			<lb />
			should also apply to Sections 8 and 45 of
			<lb />
			the Act -since the scope and nature of
			<lb />
			judicial intervention should not change
			<lb />
			upon whether a party (intending to defeat
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement) refuses to
			<lb />
			appoint an arbitrator in terms of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, or moves a
			<lb />
			proceeding before a judicial authority in
			<lb />
			the face of such an arbitration
			<lb />
			agreement.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			73. We are cognizant of the fact that the statutory language of
			<lb />
			Section 8 and 11 are different, however materially they do
			<lb />
			not vary and both Sections provide for limited judicial
			<lb />
			interference at reference stage, as enunciated above.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			74. In line with our holding on question no. 1, generally it would
			<lb />
			not have been appropriate for us to delve into the second
			<lb />
			question. However, considering that a question of law has
			<lb />
			been referred to us, we agree with the conclusions reached
			<lb />
			by our learned brother.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			75. Before we part, the conclusions reached, with respect to
			<lb />
			question no. 1, are:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			a. Sections 8 and 11 of the Act have the same ambit with
			<lb />
			respect to judicial interference.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			b. Usually, subject matter arbitrability cannot be decided at
			<lb />
			the stage of Sections 8 or 11 of the Act, unless it&apos;s a clear
			<lb />
			case of deadwood.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			c. The Court, under Sections 8 and 11, has to refer a matter
			<lb />
			to arbitration or to appoint an arbitrator, as the case may
			<lb />
			be, unless a party has established a prima facie
			<lb />
			(summary findings) case of nonexistence of valid
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement, by summarily portraying a strong
			<lb />
			case that he is entitled to such a finding.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			d. The Court should refer a matter if the validity of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement cannot be determined on a prima
			<lb />
			facie basis, as laid down above, i.e., &apos;when in doubt, do
			<lb />
			refer&apos;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			e. The scope of the Court to examine the prima facie validity
			<lb />
			of an arbitration agreement includes only:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			a. Whether the arbitration agreement was in writing?
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			b. Whether the arbitration agreement was contained in
			<lb />
			exchange of letters, telecommunication etc?
			<lb />
			c. Whether the core contractual ingredients qua the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement were fulfilled?
			<lb />
			d. On rare occasions, whether the subjectmatter of
			<lb />
			dispute is arbitrable?
			<lb />
