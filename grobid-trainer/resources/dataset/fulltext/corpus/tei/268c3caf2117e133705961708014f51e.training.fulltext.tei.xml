			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1.
			<lb />
			The 93rd Amendment to the Constitution directly or
			<lb />
			indirectly affects millions of citizens of this country. It has been
			<lb />
			challenged in a number of writ petitions. This Court heard these
			<lb />
			petitions intermittently over the course of several months.
			<lb />
			Appearing on behalf of petitioners and respondents, the
			<lb />
			country&apos;s finest legal minds assisted us.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			The fundamental question that arises in these writ petitions
			<lb />
			is: Whether Article 15(5), inserted by the 93rd Amendment, is
			<lb />
			consistent with the other provisions of the Constitution or
			<lb />
			whether its impact runs contrary to the Constitutional aim of
			<lb />
			achieving a casteless and classless society?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			On behalf of the petitioners, Senior Advocate Mr. F.S.
			<lb />
			Nariman, eloquently argued that if Article 15(5) is permitted to
			<lb />
			remain in force, then, instead of achieving the goal of a casteless
			<lb />
			and classless society, India would be converted into a caste-
			<lb />
			ridden society. The country would forever remain divided on
			<lb />
			caste lines. The Government has sought to repudiate this
			<lb />
			argument. Petitioners&apos; argument, however, echoes the grave
			<lb />
			concern of our Constitution&apos;s original Framers.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			On careful analysis of the Constituent Assembly and the
			<lb />
			Parliamentary Debates, one thing is crystal clear: our leaders
			<lb />
			have always and unanimously proclaimed with one voice that
			<lb />
			our constitutional goal is to establish a casteless and classless
			<lb />
			society. Mahatma Gandhi said: &quot;The caste system as we know is
			<lb />
			an anachronism. It must go if both Hinduism and India are to
			<lb />
			live and grow from day to day.&quot;
			<lb />
			The first Prime Minister, Pt.
			<lb />
			Jawahar Lal Nehru, said that &quot;no one should be left in any doubt
			<lb />
			that the future Indian Society was to be casteless and classless&quot;.
			<lb />
			Dr. B. R. Ambedkar called caste &quot;anti-national&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			After almost four decades of independence, while
			<lb />
			participating in the Parliamentary Debate on the Mandal issue,
			<lb />
			then Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi on 6th September, 1990
			<lb />
			again reiterated the same sentiments: &quot;I think, nobody in this
			<lb />
			House will say that the removal of casteism is not part of the
			<lb />
			national goal, therefore, it would be in the larger interest of the
			<lb />
			nation to get rid of the castes as early as possible&quot;. It is our
			<lb />
			bounden duty and obligation to examine the validity of the 93rd
			<lb />
			Amendment in the background of the Preamble and the ultimate
			<lb />
			goal that runs through the pages of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			6.
			<lb />
			To attain an egalitarian society, we have to urgently remove
			<lb />
			socio-economic inequalities. All learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			petitioners asserted that we must deliver the benefits of
			<lb />
			reservation to only those who really deserve it. This can only be
			<lb />
			done if we remove the creamy layer. Learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			Union of India and other respondents opposed this assertion.
			<lb />
			The principle of creamy layer emanates from the broad doctrine
			<lb />
			of equality itself. Unless the creamy layer is removed from
			<lb />
			admissions and service reservation, the benefits would not reach
			<lb />
			the group in whose name the impugned legislation was passed \026
			<lb />
			the poorest of the poor. Therefore, including the creamy layer
			<lb />
			would be inherently unjust.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Creamy layer exclusion, however, is just one of the many
			<lb />
			issues raised by the parties. I need to examine various facets of
			<lb />
			this case in order to decide the validity of the 93rd Amendment
			<lb />
			and the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in
			<lb />
			Admission) Bill, 2006 (passed as Act 5 of 2007) (hereinafter
			<lb />
			called the &quot;Reservation Act&quot;). I shall focus my analysis on the
			<lb />
			following issues:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			1A. Whether the creamy layer be excluded from
			<lb />
			the 93rd Amendment (Reservation Act)?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			1B. What are the parameters for creamy layer
			<lb />
			exclusion?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			1C. Is creamy layer exclusion applicable to SC/ST?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			Can the Fundamental Right under Article 21A
			<lb />
			be accomplished without great emphasis on
			<lb />
			primary education?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3.
			<lb />
			Does the 93rd Amendment violate the Basic
			<lb />
			Structure of the Constitution by imposing
			<lb />
			reservation on unaided institutions?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			4.
			<lb />
			Whether the use of caste to identify SEBCs
			<lb />
			runs afoul of the casteless/classless society,
			<lb />
			in violation of Secularism.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			5.
			<lb />
			Are Articles 15(4) and 15(5) mutually
			<lb />
			contradictory, such that 15(5) is
			<lb />
			unconstitutional?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			6.
			<lb />
			Does Article 15(5)&apos;s exemption of minority
			<lb />
			institutions from the purview of reservation
			<lb />
			violate Article 14 of the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			7.
			<lb />
			Are the standards of review laid down by the
			<lb />
			U.S. Supreme Court applicable to our review
			<lb />
			of affirmative action under Art 15(5) and
			<lb />
			similar provisions?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			8.
			<lb />
			With respect to OBC identification, was the
			<lb />
			Reservation Act&apos;s delegation of power to the
			<lb />
			Union Government excessive?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			9.
			<lb />
			Is the impugned legislation invalid as it fails
			<lb />
			to set a time-limit for caste-based
			<lb />
			reservation?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			10. At what point is a student no longer
			<lb />
			Educationally Backward and thus no longer
			<lb />
			eligible for special provisions under 15(5)?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			11.
			<lb />
			Would it be reasonable to balance OBC
			<lb />
			reservation with societal interests by
			<lb />
			instituting OBC cut-off marks that are slightly
			<lb />
			lower than that of the general category?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			I have carefully examined the pleadings and written
			<lb />
			submissions submitted at length. Admittedly, the provisions of
			<lb />
			the Constitution and the Preamble lead to the irresistible
			<lb />
			conclusion that the Nation has always wanted to achieve a
			<lb />
			casteless and classless society. If we permit this impugned
			<lb />
			legislation to be implemented, I am afraid, instead of a casteless
			<lb />
			and classless India, we would be left with a caste-ridden society.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			The first place where caste can be eradicated is the
			<lb />
			classroom. It all starts with education. In other words, if you
			<lb />
			belong to a lower caste but are well qualified, hardly anyone
			<lb />
			would care about your caste. Free and compulsory education is
			<lb />
			now a fundamental right under Article 21A. The State is duty
			<lb />
			bound to implement this Article on a priority basis. There has
			<lb />
			been grave laxity in its implementation. This laxity adversely
			<lb />
			affects almost every walk of life. In my opinion, nothing is more
			<lb />
			important for the Union of India than to implement this critical
			<lb />
			Article.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10.
			<lb />
			I direct the Union of India to set a time-limit within which
			<lb />
			this Article is going to be completely implemented. This time-
			<lb />
			limit must be set within six months. In case the Union of India
			<lb />
			fails to fix the time-limit, then perhaps this work will also have to
			<lb />
			be done by the Court.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11.
			<lb />
			The Union of India should appreciate in proper prospective
			<lb />
			that the root cause of social and educational backwardness is
			<lb />
			poverty. All efforts have to be made to eradicate this
			<lb />
			fundamental problem. Unless the creamy layer is removed, the
			<lb />
			benefit would not reach those who are in need. Reservation
			<lb />
			sends the wrong message. Everybody is keen to get the benefit of
			<lb />
			backward class status. If we want to really help the socially,
			<lb />
			educationally and economically backward classes, we need to
			<lb />
			earnestly focus on implementing Article 21A. We must provide
			<lb />
			educational opportunity from day one. Only then will the
			<lb />
			casteless/classless society be within our grasp. Once children
			<lb />
			are of college-going age, it is too late for reservation to have much
			<lb />
			of an effect. The problem with the Reservation Act is that most
			<lb />
			of the beneficiaries will belong to the creamy layer, a group for
			<lb />
			which no benefits are necessary. Only non-creamy layer OBCs
			<lb />
			can avail of reservations in college admissions, and once they
			<lb />
			graduate from college they should no longer be eligible for post-
			<lb />
			graduate reservation. 27% is the upper limit for OBC
			<lb />
			reservation. The Government need not always provide the
			<lb />
			maximum limit. Reasonable cut off marks should be set so that
			<lb />
			standards of excellence greatly effect. The unfilled seats should
			<lb />
			revert to the general category.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12.
			<lb />
			These issues first arise out of the text of the impugned
			<lb />
			Amendment. Reservation for Socially and Educationally
			<lb />
			Backward Classes of Citizens (SEBCs) was introduced by the 93rd
			<lb />
			Amendment. Article 15(5) states:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause
			<lb />
			(1) of article 19 shall prevent the State from making
			<lb />
			any special provision, by law, for the advancement of
			<lb />
			any socially and educationally backward classes of
			<lb />
			citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled
			<lb />
			Tribes in so far as such special provisions relate to
			<lb />
			their admission to educational institutions including
			<lb />
			private educational institutions, whether aided or
			<lb />
			unaided by the State, other than minority educational
			<lb />
			institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			?
			<lb />
			Excluding the Creamy Layer from receiving
			<lb />
			special benefits:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			13.
			<lb />
			Affirmative action is employed to eliminate substantive
			<lb />
			social and economic inequality by providing opportunities to
			<lb />
			those who may not otherwise gain admission or employment.
			<lb />
			Articles 14, 15 and 16 allow for affirmative action. To promote
			<lb />
			Article 14 egalitarian equality, the State may classify citizens into
			<lb />
			groups, giving preferential treatment to one over another. When
			<lb />
			it classifies, the State must keep those who are unequal out of
			<lb />
			the same batch to achieve constitutional goal of egalitarian
			<lb />
			society.

		<lb />

			<lb />
			Arguments of the Union of India in regard to the
			<lb />
			creamy layer:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			14.
			<lb />
			Mr. G.E. Vahanvati, learned Solicitor General and Mr K.
			<lb />
			Parasaran, Senior Advocate appearing for the Government
			<lb />
			contend that creamy layer exclusion is a bad policy. They argue
			<lb />
			that if you exclude the creamy layer, there would be a shortage of
			<lb />
			candidates who can afford to pay for higher education. This
			<lb />
			argument harms rather than helps the Government. It cannot
			<lb />
			be seriously disputed that most of the college-going OBCs belong
			<lb />
			to the creamy layer for whom reservations are unnecessary; they
			<lb />
			have the money to attend good schools, tuitions and coaching
			<lb />
			courses for entrance exams. Naturally, these advantages result
			<lb />
			in higher test scores vis-&apos;-vis the non-creamy layer OBCs. The
			<lb />
			result is that creamy OBCs would fill the bulk of the OBC quota,
			<lb />
			leaving the non-creamy no better off than before. If the creamy
			<lb />
			get most of the benefit, why have reservations in the first place?
			<lb />
			Learned Senior Counsel for petitioners, Mr. Harish Salve, is
			<lb />
			justified in arguing that before carrying out Constitutional
			<lb />
			Amendments the Union of India must clearly target its
			<lb />
			beneficiaries. He rightly submitted that we should not make law
			<lb />
			first and thereafter target the law&apos;s beneficiaries. Failure to
			<lb />
			exclude the creamy layer is but one example of this problem.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15.
			<lb />
			The Government further submitted that the creamy layer
			<lb />
			should be included to ensure that enough qualified candidates
			<lb />
			fill 27% of the seats reserved to OBCs. The Oversight Committee
			<lb />
			disagreed. The Committee relied on data from Karnataka to
			<lb />
			disprove the contention that seats go unfilled when the creamy is
			<lb />
			excluded: &quot;\005 the apprehension that seats will not be filled up if
			<lb />
			the creamy layer is excluded has been comprehensively shown to
			<lb />
			be unfounded.&quot; [See: Oversight Committee, Vol. 1, Sept. 2006, p.
			<lb />
			69, para 1.7.] We shall later review the Oversight Committee
			<lb />
			opinion in greater detail.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			?
			<lb />
			The reasons for which the creamy layer should
			<lb />
			be excluded:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16.
			<lb />
			At the outset, I note that the Parliament rejected the Hindi
			<lb />
			version of the Reservation Act. The Hindi version of the
			<lb />
			Reservation Act would have expressly excluded the creamy layer.
			<lb />
			[See: Prof. Rasa Singh Rawat&apos;s comments in the Parliamentary
			<lb />
			Debate on the Reservation Act, 14 December 2006]
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17.
			<lb />
			The Parliament eventually passed the English version in
			<lb />
			which the creamy layer is not mentioned, making its intention
			<lb />
			clear. It wanted to include the creamy layer. For all practical
			<lb />
			purposes, it did so. Therefore, I will treat it as included.
			<lb />
			Counsel for the Union of India argued that it is still theoretically
			<lb />
			possible for the executive to exclude the creamy layer. Much is
			<lb />
			possible in theory. Given the executive&apos;s failure to take action
			<lb />
			since the time the Act was passed, I find this argument
			<lb />
			unavailing.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18.
			<lb />
			With the Parliament&apos;s intention in view, I will deal in some
			<lb />
			detail with the reasons as to why the creamy layer should be
			<lb />
			excluded from reservation. I do so because I want to emphasize
			<lb />
			that the creamy layer must never be included in any affirmative
			<lb />
			action legislation. It also becomes imperative to gather the
			<lb />
			original Framers&apos; and the Framers&apos; intention. At the outset, we
			<lb />
			recognise a distinction between the original Framers and the
			<lb />
			Framers, i.e., Members of the First Parliament. Members of the
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly and the First Parliament were one in the
			<lb />
			same. But the distinction is necessary to the extent that the
			<lb />
			First Parliament deviated from its constitutional philosophy. By
			<lb />
			examining the debate on Article 15(4), I may ascertain whether
			<lb />
			the Framers wanted to exclude the creamy layer.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19.
			<lb />
			The First Parliament believed that &quot;economic&quot; was included
			<lb />
			in the &quot;social&quot; portion of &quot;socially and educationally backward.&quot;
			<lb />
			Prime Minister Nehru said as much:
			<lb />
			&quot;One of the main amendments or ideas put forward is
			<lb />
			in regard to the addition of the word &quot;economical&quot;.
			<lb />
			Frankly, the argument put forward, with slight
			<lb />
			variation, I would accept, but my difficult is this that
			<lb />
			when we chose those particular words there, &quot;for the
			<lb />
			advancement of any socially and educationally
			<lb />
			backward classes&quot;, we chose them because they occur
			<lb />
			in article 340 and we wanted to bring them bodily
			<lb />
			from there. Otherwise I would have had not the
			<lb />
			slightest objection to add &quot;economically&quot;. But if I
			<lb />
			added &quot;economically&quot; I would at the same time not
			<lb />
			make it a kind of cumulative thing but would say that
			<lb />
			a person who is lacking in any of these things should
			<lb />
			be helped. &quot;Socially&quot; is a much wider word including
			<lb />
			many things and certainly including economically.
			<lb />
			Therefore, I felt that &quot;socially and educationally&quot; really
			<lb />
			cover the ground and at the same time you bring out a
			<lb />
			phrase used in another part of the Constitution in a
			<lb />
			slightly similar context.&quot; (See: the Parliamentary
			<lb />
			Debates on First Amendment Bill, 1 June 1951, p.
			<lb />
			9830.)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			Had it not been for a desire to achieve symmetry in drafting,
			<lb />
			&quot;economically&quot; would have been included. Had this been done,
			<lb />
			the creamy layer would have been excluded ab initio.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20.
			<lb />
			In the 15(4) debate, Shri M.A. Ayyangar&apos;s wanted to add
			<lb />
			&quot;economic&quot; to ensure that the rich SEBCs would not receive
			<lb />
			special provisions.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			&quot;I thought &quot;economic&quot; might be added so that rich
			<lb />
			men may not take advantage of this provision. In my
			<lb />
			part of the country there are the Nattukkottai
			<lb />
			Chettiars who do not care to have English education,
			<lb />
			but they are the richest of the lot \005 should there be
			<lb />
			special reservation for them?&quot; (See: The Parliamentary
			<lb />
			Debates on First Amendment Bill, 1 June 1951, p.
			<lb />
			9817.)
			<lb />
			(emphasis added).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			This hesitation aside, Shri M.A. Ayyangar was satisfied that the
			<lb />
			term &quot;economic&quot; was included in the term &quot;social.&quot; The Framers
			<lb />
			were worried about creamy layer inclusion, albeit under a
			<lb />
			different name. They wanted to ensure that the &quot;richest of the
			<lb />
			[backward] lot&quot; would not benefit from special provisions. With
			<lb />
			their sentiment on our side, we are even more confident that we
			<lb />
			should strike out in the direction that strikes down laws that
			<lb />
			include the creamy layer.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			?
			<lb />
			Including the creamy layer means unequals are
			<lb />
			treated as equals in violation of the right to
			<lb />
			equality under Articles 14, 15 and 16.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21.
			<lb />
			In the present case, Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, the learned Senior
			<lb />
			Counsel and Mr. S.K. Jain, the learned counsel vehemently
			<lb />
			argued on behalf of petitioners that it is precisely because
			<lb />
			equality is at issue that the creamy layer must be removed. The
			<lb />
			creamy layer has been the subject matter of a number of
			<lb />
			celebrated judgments of this Court. In a seven Judge Bench in
			<lb />
			State of Kerala &amp; Another v. N. M. Thomas &amp; Others (1976)
			<lb />
			2 SCC 310, Justice Mathew, in his concurring judgment, dealt
			<lb />
			with the right to equality in the following words:
			<lb />
			&quot;66. The guarantee of equality before the law or the
			<lb />
			equal opportunity in matters of employment is a
			<lb />
			guarantee of something more than what is required by
			<lb />
			formal equality. It implies differential treatment of
			<lb />
			persons who are unequal. Egalitarian principle has
			<lb />
			therefore enhanced the growing belief that
			<lb />
			Government has an affirmative duty to eliminate
			<lb />
			inequalities and to provide opportunities for the
			<lb />
			exercise of human rights and claims. \005\005\005&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>
			22.
			<lb />
			In Indra Sawhney &amp; Others v. Union of India &amp; Others
			<lb />
			(1992) Supp (3) SCC 217, (hereinafter referred to as Sawhney I),
			<lb />
			this Court has aptly observed that reservation is given to
			<lb />
			backward classes until they cease to be backward, and not
			<lb />
			indefinitely. This Court in para 520 (Sawant, J.) has stated as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Society does not remain static. The
			<lb />
			industrialisation and the urbanisation which
			<lb />
			necessarily followed in its wake, the advance on
			<lb />
			political, social and economic fronts made particularly
			<lb />
			after the commencement of the Constitution, the
			<lb />
			social reform movements of the last several decades,
			<lb />
			the spread of education and the advantages of the
			<lb />
			special provisions including reservations secured so
			<lb />
			far, have all undoubtedly seen at least some
			<lb />
			individuals and families in the backward classes,
			<lb />
			however small in number, gaining sufficient means to
			<lb />
			develop their capacities to compete with others in
			<lb />
			every field. That is an undeniable fact. Legally,
			<lb />
			therefore, they are not entitled to be any longer called
			<lb />
			as part of the backward classes whatever their original
			<lb />
			birthmark. It can further hardly be argued that once a
			<lb />
			backward class, always a backward class. That would
			<lb />
			defeat the very purpose of the special provisions made
			<lb />
			in the Constitution for the advancement of the
			<lb />
			backward classes, and for enabling them to come to
			<lb />
			the level of and to compete with the forward classes,
			<lb />
			as equal citizens.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			23.
			<lb />
			For our purposes, creamy layer OBCs and non-creamy layer
			<lb />
			OBCs are not equals when it comes to moving up the socio-
			<lb />
			economic ladder by means of educational opportunity. Failing to
			<lb />
			remove the creamy layer treats creamy layer OBCs and non-
			<lb />
			creamy layer OBCs as equals. In the same paragraph, Justice
			<lb />
			Sawant stated that &quot;\005 to rank [the creamy layer] with the rest of
			<lb />
			the backward classes would \005 amount to treating the unequals
			<lb />
			equally...&quot; violating the equality provisions of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			24.
			<lb />
			According to the Kerala Legislature, there was no creamy
			<lb />
			layer in Kerala. The legislation was challenged in Indra
			<lb />
			Sawhney v. Union of India &amp; Others (2000) 1 SCC 168,
			<lb />
			(hereinafter referred to as Sawhney II). The Court struck the
			<lb />
			two provisions that barred creamy layer exclusion, concluding
			<lb />
			that non-inclusion of the creamy-layer and inclusion of forward
			<lb />
			castes in reservation violates the right to equality under Article
			<lb />
			14 and the basic structure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			25.
			<lb />
			In Sawhney II at para 65, the Court had gone to the extent
			<lb />
			of observing that not even the Parliament, by constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment, could dismantle the basic structure by including the
			<lb />
			creamy layer in reservation:
			<lb />
			&quot;What we mean to say is that the Parliament and the
			<lb />
			legislature in this country cannot transgress the basic
			<lb />
			feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of
			<lb />
			equality enshrined in Article 14 of which Article 16(1)
			<lb />
			is a facet. Whether the creamy layer is not excluded or
			<lb />
			whether forward castes get included in the list of
			<lb />
			backward classes, the position will be the same,
			<lb />
			namely, that there will be a breach not only of Article
			<lb />
			14 but of the basic structure of the Constitution. The
			<lb />
			non-exclusion of the creamy layer or the inclusion of
			<lb />
			forward castes in the list of backward classes will,
			<lb />
			therefore, be totally illegal. Such an illegality offending
			<lb />
			the root of the Constitution of India cannot be allowed
			<lb />
			to be perpetuated even by constitutional amendment.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			26.
			<lb />
			By definition, the creamy and non-creamy are unequal
			<lb />
			when it comes to schooling. Relative to their non-creamy
			<lb />
			counterparts, the creamy have a distinct advantage in gaining
			<lb />
			admission. While the creamy and non-creamy are given equal
			<lb />
			opportunity to gain admission in the reserved category, this
			<lb />
			equality exists in name only. Will the OBC daughter of a
			<lb />
			Minister, IAS officer or affluent business owner attend better
			<lb />
			schools than her non-creamy counterpart? Yes. Will she go to
			<lb />
			private tuitions unaffordable to her non-creamy counterpart?
			<lb />
			Certainly. And where will she cram for the all-decisive entrance
			<lb />
			exams? In a coaching center? Of course. Will she come home
			<lb />
			from school to find a family member waiting? Probably. And
			<lb />
			when she seeks help from her parents, are they educated and
			<lb />
			able to give superior assistance with schoolwork? Most likely.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			27.
			<lb />
			I take judicial notice of these anecdotes, for they flesh out a
			<lb />
			simple fact: she has all the resources that her non-creamy
			<lb />
			counterpart lacks. It is no surprise that she will outperform the
			<lb />
			non-creamy. On average, her lot will take the reserved seats.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			28.
			<lb />
			I cannot consider the OBC Minister&apos;s daughter and the non-
			<lb />
			creamy OBC as equals in terms of their chances at earning a
			<lb />
			university seat; nor can I allow them to be treated equally. To
			<lb />
			lump them in the same category is an unreasonable
			<lb />
			classification. Putting them in head-to-head competition for the
			<lb />
			same seats violates the right to equality in Articles 14, 15 and
			<lb />
			16.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			29.
			<lb />
			In its conclusion at para 122, M. Nagaraj &amp; Others v.
			<lb />
			Union of India &amp; Others (2006) 8 SCC 212, a Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench of this Court while dealing with Article 16(4A) and 16(4B)
			<lb />
			with regard to SC and ST observed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;We reiterate that the ceiling limit of 50%, the concept
			<lb />
			of creamy layer and the compelling reasons, namely,
			<lb />
			backwardness, inadequacy of representation and
			<lb />
			overall administrative efficiency are all constitutional
			<lb />
			requirements without which the structure of equality
			<lb />
			of opportunity in Article 16 would collapse.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			It was contended that Nagraj is obiter in regard to creamy layer
			<lb />
			exclusion. According to Nagraj, reservation in promotion for
			<lb />
			SC/ST is contingent on exclusion of the creamy layer. (paras
			<lb />
			122, 123 and 124). The contention of the Union of India cannot
			<lb />
			be accepted. The discussion regarding creamy layer is far from
			<lb />
			obiter in Nagraj. If the State fails to exclude the SC/ST creamy
			<lb />
			layer, the reservation must fall. Placing this contingency in the
			<lb />
			conclusion makes the discussion of creamy layer part of the
			<lb />
			ratio.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			30.
			<lb />
			In sum, creamy layer inclusion violates the right to equality.
			<lb />
			That is, non-exclusion of creamy layer and inclusion of forward
			<lb />
			castes in reservation violates the right to equality in Articles 14,
			<lb />
			15 and 16 as well as the basic structure of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			?
			<lb />
			If you belong to the creamy layer, you are not
			<lb />
			SEBC.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31.
			<lb />
			One of the prominent questions raised in the writ petitions
			<lb />
			is whether creamy layer OBCs should be considered socially and
			<lb />
			educationally backward under the provisions of Article 15(5).
			<lb />
			While interpreting this provision, a basic syllogism must govern
			<lb />
			our decision. If you belong to the creamy layer, you are socially
			<lb />
			advanced and cannot be given the benefit of reservation. (See:
			<lb />
			Sawhney I).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			32.
			<lb />
			Once one is socially advanced, he cannot be socially and
			<lb />
			educationally backward. He who is socially forward is likely to
			<lb />
			be educationally forward as well. If either condition (social or
			<lb />
			educational) goes unmet, one cannot qualify for the benefit of
			<lb />
			reservation as SEBC. Being socially advanced, the creamy layer
			<lb />
			is not socially backward pursuant to Articles 15(4) and 15(5) of
			<lb />
			the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			33.
			<lb />
			Even the text of Articles 15(4) and 15(5) provides for creamy
			<lb />
			layer exclusion. In this sense, one could say that the term
			<lb />
			&quot;creamy layer&quot; is synonymous with &quot;non-SEBC&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			34.
			<lb />
			Similar interpretation is given to &quot;backward classes&quot; under
			<lb />
			Article 16(4). The Parliament could not reasonably make
			<lb />
			reservation for non-backwards. Such a Bill on the face of it
			<lb />
			would violate the Constitution. In Sawhney I, the Government of
			<lb />
			India issued an O.M. on 13 August 1990, reserving 27% of
			<lb />
			Government posts to SEBCs. Writing for the majority, at para
			<lb />
			792 of page 724, Justice Reddy explained that the creamy layer
			<lb />
			was not SEBC.
			<lb />
			&quot;The very concept of a class denotes a number of
			<lb />
			persons having certain common traits which
			<lb />
			distinguish them from the others. In a backward class
			<lb />
			under Clause (4) of Article 16, if the connecting link is
			<lb />
			the social backwardness, it should broadly be the
			<lb />
			same in a given class. If some of the members are far
			<lb />
			too advanced socially (which in the context,
			<lb />
			necessarily means economically and, may also mean
			<lb />
			educationally) the connecting thread between them
			<lb />
			and the remaining class snaps. They would be misfits
			<lb />
			in the class. After excluding them alone, would the
			<lb />
			class be a compact class. In fact, such exclusion
			<lb />
			benefits the truly backward&quot;
			<lb />
			Even though the O.M. was silent on the issue of creamy layer,
			<lb />
			Justice Reddy excluded the creamy layer at para 859(3)(d). The
			<lb />
			O.M. could not go into effect until the creamy layer was
			<lb />
			excluded. [para 861(b)].
			<lb />
			Exclusion was only in regard to OBC;
			<lb />
			SC/ST were not touched. (para 792). In Sawhney I, the entire
			<lb />
			discussion was confined only to Other Backward Classes.
			<lb />
			Similarly, in the instant case, the entire discussion was confined
			<lb />
			only to Other Backward Classes. Therefore, I express no opinion
			<lb />
			with regard to the applicability of exclusion of creamy layer to the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			?
			<lb />
			Creamy Layer OBCs are not educationally
			<lb />
			backward
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			35.
			<lb />
			In addition to social backwardness, the text of 15(5)
			<lb />
			demands that recipients are also educationally backward. Even
			<lb />
			though the creamy layer&apos;s status as socially advanced is
			<lb />
			sufficient to disqualify them for preferential treatment, the
			<lb />
			creamy layer from any community is usually educated and will
			<lb />
			want the same for its children. They know that education is the
			<lb />
			key to success. For most, it made them. People belonging to this
			<lb />
			group do not require reservation.

			Creamy Layer Inclusion Robs the Poor and Gives
			<lb />
			to the Rich:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			36.
			<lb />
			In a number of judgments, the view has been taken that the
			<lb />
			creamy layer&apos;s inclusion takes from the poor and gives to the
			<lb />
			rich.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			37.
			<lb />
			Our Courts in following cases had taken the same view.
			<lb />
			[See: N.M Thomas (supra), para 124 (seven-Judge Bench); K.C.
			<lb />
			Vasanth Kumar &amp; Another v. State of Karnataka, 1985
			<lb />
			(Supp) SCC 714, paras 2, 24 and 28 (five-Judge Bench);

		<p>
			38.
			<lb />
			In Akhil Bharatiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh (Railway)
			<lb />
			v. Union of India &amp; Others (1981) 1 SCC 246, Justice Iyer had
			<lb />
			this to say about the creamy layer:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;92. \005 Maybe, some of the forward lines of the
			<lb />
			backward classes have the best of both the worlds and
			<lb />
			their electoral muscle qua caste scares away even
			<lb />
			radical parties from talking secularism to them. We
			<lb />
			are not concerned with that dubious brand. In the
			<lb />
			long run, the recipe for backwardness is not creating a
			<lb />
			vested interest in backward castes but liquidation of
			<lb />
			handicaps, social and economic, by constructive
			<lb />
			projects. All this is in another street and we need not
			<lb />
			walk that way now.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			94. \005 Nor does the specious plea that because a few
			<lb />
			harijans are better off, therefore, the bulk at the
			<lb />
			bottom deserves no jack-up provisions merit scrutiny.
			<lb />
			A swallow does not make a summer. Maybe, the State
			<lb />
			may, when social conditions warrant, justifiably
			<lb />
			restrict harijan benefits to the harijans among the
			<lb />
			harijans and forbid the higher harijans from robbing
			<lb />
			the lowlier brethren.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			39.
			<lb />
			Creamy layer inclusion was not enough to strike an entire
			<lb />
			provision in this case. He suggests that creamy layer exclusion is
			<lb />
			an issue to be dealt with at a later time.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			&quot;
			98.
			<lb />
			The argument that there are rich and influential
			<lb />
			harijans who rob all the privileges leaving the serf-level
			<lb />
			sufferers as suppressed as ever. The Administration
			<lb />
			may well innovate and classify to weed out the creamy
			<lb />
			layer of SCs/STs but the court cannot force the State
			<lb />
			in that behalf.&quot;
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			Thus, Justice Iyer does not mandate creamy layer exclusion;
			<lb />
			rather, he leaves the question to the State.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			40.
			<lb />
			Apart from judicial pronouncements, the Oversight
			<lb />
			Committee suggested that failure to exclude the creamy layer
			<lb />
			would lead to unfair results. The Committee was cautious to
			<lb />
			reach a conclusion.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			41.
			<lb />
			In its Report, it stated that &quot;\005 the decision taken was to
			<lb />
			leave the matter to the Government of India, keeping in mind the
			<lb />
			fact that the &apos;creamy layer&apos; is not covered in the Reservation Act,
			<lb />
			2006.&quot; (See: Oversight Committee, Vol. 1, p. 33 and 4.2.)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			42.
			<lb />
			Before &quot;leaving&quot; the matter to the Government, the
			<lb />
			Committee nevertheless made its recommendation: &quot;In case it is
			<lb />
			decided not to exclude the &apos;creamy layer&apos;, the poorest among the
			<lb />
			OBCs will be placed at a disadvantage.&quot; (emphasis added). (See:
			<lb />
			Oversight Committee at Appendix I in its Report at p. 70, para
			<lb />
			1.13). At page 69 of Vol. I of its Report, the Committee offered
			<lb />
			data to support this conclusion:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;1.6: Appendix-2 examines in detail the status of the
			<lb />
			socio-economic development of OBCs in respect of
			<lb />
			such parameters as relate to poverty, health,
			<lb />
			education, unemployment, workforce participation,
			<lb />
			land ownership etc. The analysis of the NSS data
			<lb />
			clearly brings out that inclusion of the creamy layer
			<lb />
			will result in reserved seats getting pre-empted by the
			<lb />
			OBCs from the top two deciles at the cost of the poorer
			<lb />
			income deciles of the OBCs. Thus almost all rural
			<lb />
			OBCs as well as Urban OBCs from the Northern,
			<lb />
			Central and Eastern regions of India will be deprived
			<lb />
			of the intended benefits of reservation.
			<lb />
			[emphas
			<lb />
			is added]
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			1.7: On the other hand, it was argued that if the
			<lb />
			creamy layer of OBCs is denied access to reservation
			<lb />
			in education pari-passau with the principle applied in
			<lb />
			the case of employment, the reserved seats may not
			<lb />
			get filled up, again defeating the purpose of bringing in
			<lb />
			reservation for the OBCs. In a case study from
			<lb />
			Karnataka (included in Annexure X), it has been
			<lb />
			clearly shown that the OBC quotas have been utilized
			<lb />
			without any compromise with academic excellence in a
			<lb />
			situation where the creamy layer has been excluded.
			<lb />
			The apprehension that seats will not be filled up if the
			<lb />
			creamy layer is excluded has been comprehensively
			<lb />
			shown to be unfounded. The case study shows that
			<lb />
			the performance of students from below the creamy
			<lb />
			layer is outstanding and much better than general
			<lb />
			category students.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			43.
			<lb />
			The Committee could have played it safe. Despite some
			<lb />
			opposition, the Committee included its opinion on the matter.
			<lb />
			And that opinion is unequivocal: the creamy must be excluded.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			44.
			<lb />
			What is allegedly for the poor goes to the rich. Is that
			<lb />
			reasonable? Trumpeted by the Parliament as a &quot;\005boost to the
			<lb />
			morale of the downtrodden&quot; and &quot;\005 in the right direction of
			<lb />
			ensuring social justice to other backward classes \005&quot; and
			<lb />
			&quot;ensuring social justice to those weaker sections \005&quot;, Article 15(5)
			<lb />
			dupes those who actually need preferential treatment. (See: Prof.
			<lb />
			Basudeb Barman, M.P., the Parliamentary Debates, p. 531,
			<lb />
			December 21, 2005; Prof. M. Ramadass, M.P., at p. 510; and
			<lb />
			Shri C.K. Chandrappan, M.P., at p. 494 respectively). For the
			<lb />
			poorest of the poor, reservation in college is an empty promise.
			<lb />
			Few of the financially poor OBCs attend high school, let alone
			<lb />
			college. Instead of rewarding those that complete Plus 2, the 93rd
			<lb />
			Amendment (Art 15(5)) poses another barrier: they will have to
			<lb />
			compete with the creamy layer for reserved seats.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			45.
			<lb />
			As explained, the poor lack the resources to compete with
			<lb />
			the creamy, who &quot;snatch away&quot; those seats. {N. M. Thomas
			<lb />
			(supra), para 124 (Iyer, J.)}. With the creamy excluded, poor
			<lb />
			OBCs would compete with poor OBCs \026 the playing field levelled.
			<lb />
			As it stands, the Amendment and Act serve one purpose: they
			<lb />
			provide a windfall of seats to the rich and powerful amongst the
			<lb />
			OBCs. It is unreasonable to classify rich and poor OBCs as a
			<lb />
			single entity. As noted, this violates the Article 14 right to
			<lb />
			equality.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			46.
			<lb />
			Unless the creamy layer is removed, OBCs cannot exercise
			<lb />
			their group rights. The Union of India and other respondents
			<lb />
			argued that creamy layer exclusion is wrong because the text of
			<lb />
			the 93rd Amendment bestows a benefit on &quot;classes&quot;, not
			<lb />
			individuals. While it is a group right, the group must contain
			<lb />
			only those individuals that belong to the group. I first take the
			<lb />
			entire lot of creamy and non creamy layer OBCs. I then remove
			<lb />
			the creamy layer on an individual basis based on their income,
			<lb />
			property holdings, occupation, etc. What is left is a group that
			<lb />
			meets constitutional muster. It is a group right that must also
			<lb />
			belong to individuals, if the right is to have any meaning. If one
			<lb />
			OBC candidate is denied special provisions that he should have
			<lb />
			received by law, it is not the group&apos;s responsibility to bring a
			<lb />
			claim. He would be the one to do so. He has a right of action to
			<lb />
			challenge the ruling that excluded him from the special
			<lb />
			provisions afforded to OBCs. In this sense, he has an individual
			<lb />
			right. Group and individual rights need not be mutually
			<lb />
			exclusive. In this case, it is not one or the other but both that
			<lb />
			apply to the impugned legislation.

			<lb />
			Whether the Creamy Layer exists outside India?:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			47.
			<lb />
			An interesting question arises: does the concept of creamy
			<lb />
			layer exist outside India?
			<lb />
			A 2003 study carried out in the
			<lb />
			United States suggests that it does. The study by William
			<lb />
			Bowen, former president of Princeton University, found that
			<lb />
			when you look at students with the same Scholastic Aptitude
			<lb />
			Test (SAT) scores, certain groups have a better chance of being
			<lb />
			admitted to college. &quot;The New Affirmative Action,&quot; by David
			<lb />
			Leonhardt, New York Times, 30 September 2007, p. 3. All things
			<lb />
			being equal, one&apos;s chance of gaining admission is augmented by
			<lb />
			belonging to one of the preferred groups. Individuals belonging to
			<lb />
			these groups are given preferential treatment over those who do
			<lb />
			not.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			48.
			<lb />
			The study demonstrated that Black, Latino and Native-
			<lb />
			Americans with the same SAT scores as White or Asian students
			<lb />
			had a 28% better chance than the White or Asian students at
			<lb />
			gaining admission; those whose parents attended the college had
			<lb />
			a 20% advantage over those whose parents did not; and the poor
			<lb />
			received no advantage whatsoever over the rich. (See: New York
			<lb />
			Times article, p. 3.)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			49.
			<lb />
			The statistics indicate that the failure to exclude the creamy
			<lb />
			layer ultimately leads to a situation in which deserving students
			<lb />
			are excluded. When we revert to the Indian scenario, as long as
			<lb />
			the Government gives handouts to certain groups, the creamy
			<lb />
			layer therein will &quot;lap&quot; them up. A scheme in which the poor
			<lb />
			receive no advantage can be remedied by excluding the creamy
			<lb />
			layer.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			50.
			<lb />
			Even the Mandal Commission, which was established in
			<lb />
			1979 with a mandate to identify the socially and educationally
			<lb />
			backward, admitted that the creamy layer was robbing fellow
			<lb />
			OBCs of reservation. In reference to Tamil Nadu, it said: &quot;In
			<lb />
			actual operation, the benefits of reservation have gone primarily
			<lb />
			to the relatively more advanced castes amongst the notified
			<lb />
			backward classes.&quot; (See: P.37, 8.13 of the Report of the
			<lb />
			Backward Classes Commission, First Part, Vols. 1-2, 1980). It
			<lb />
			also stated that: &quot;it is no doubt true that the major benefits of
			<lb />
			reservation\005..will be cornered by the more advanced
			<lb />
			sections\005 ..&quot; but reasoned that this was acceptable because
			<lb />
			reform is presumably slow and should start with the more
			<lb />
			advanced of the backward. (See: Page 62, para 13.7
			<lb />
			(recommendations)).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51.
			<lb />
			In N. M. Thomas &amp; Others case (supra), Krishna Iyer, J.
			<lb />
			in his concurring judgment in para 124 noted that the research
			<lb />
			conducted by the A.N. Sinha Institute of Social Studies, Patna,
			<lb />
			had revealed a dual society among harijans in which a tiny elite
			<lb />
			gobbles up the benefits.

			<lb />
			Severing the Creamy Layer
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			52.
			<lb />
			Technically speaking, I am severing the implied inclusion of
			<lb />
			the creamy layer. It is severable for two reasons. First, a nine-
			<lb />
			Judge Bench in Sawhney I severed a similar provision wherein
			<lb />
			the creamy layer was not expressly included, upholding the rest
			<lb />
			of the O.M.&apos;s reservation scheme. Second, because the
			<lb />
			Parliament must have known that
			<lb />
			Sawhney I had excluded the
			<lb />
			creamy layer, it seems likely that the Parliament also realized
			<lb />
			that this Court may do the same. A cursory review of the
			<lb />
			Parliamentary Debates regarding Article 15(5) clearly reveals that
			<lb />
			the Parliament discussed the Sawhney I judgment in detail.
			<lb />
			(See: for example, comments made by Shri Mohan Singh, p.474
			<lb />
			and Shri Devendra Prasad, pages 478-479 on 21 December
			<lb />
			2005). Had the Parliament insisted on creamy layer inclusion, it
			<lb />
			could have said as much in the text of 15(5). Instead, the
			<lb />
			Parliament left the text of 15(5) silent on the issue, delegating the
			<lb />
			issue of OBC identification to the executive in Section 2(g) of the
			<lb />
			Reservation Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			53.
			<lb />
			The test for severability asks a subjective question: had the
			<lb />
			Parliament known its provision would be struck would it still
			<lb />
			have passed the rest of the legislation? (See: R.M.D.
			<lb />
			Chamarbaugwalla &amp; Another v. Union of India &amp; Another,
			<lb />
			AIR 1957 SC 628 at page 637 at para 23). It is never easy to say
			<lb />
			what the Parliament would have done had it known that part of
			<lb />
			its amendment would be severed. Nevertheless, I find it hard to
			<lb />
			imagine that the Parliament would have said, &quot;if the creamy is
			<lb />
			excluded, the rest of the OBCs should be denied reservation in
			<lb />
			education.&quot;
			<lb />
			It seems unlikely that it would have been an all-or-
			<lb />
			nothing proposition for the Parliament, when the very goal of the
			<lb />
			impugned legislation of promoting OBC educational
			<lb />
			advancement does not depend on creamy layer inclusion. For
			<lb />
			these reasons, I sever or exclude the implied inclusion of the
			<lb />
			creamy layer.

			<lb />
			Income as the criterion for creamy layer exclusion is
			<lb />
			insufficient and runs afoul of Sawhney I. (See: page 724 at para
			<lb />
			792). Identification of the creamy layer has been and should be
			<lb />
			left to the Government, subject to judicial direction. For a valid
			<lb />
			method of creamy layer exclusion, the Government may use its
			<lb />
			post-Sawhney I criteria as a template. (See: O.M. of 8-9-1993,
			<lb />
			para 2(c)/Column 3, approved by this Court in Ashoka Kumar
			<lb />
			Thakur (supra), para 10). This schedule is a comprehensive
			<lb />
			attempt to exclude the creamy layer in which income,
			<lb />
			Government posts, occupation and land holdings are taken into
			<lb />
			account. The Office Memorandum is reproduced hereunder:

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) both irrigated and unirrigated
			<lb />
			land, as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The rule of exclusion will
			<lb />
			apply where the pre-condition
			<lb />
			exists that the irrigated area
			<lb />
			(having been brought to a
			<lb />
			single type under a common
			<lb />
			denominator) 40% or more of
			<lb />
			the statutory ceiling, limit for
			<lb />
			irrigated land (this being,
			<lb />
			calculated by excluding the
			<lb />
			unirrigated portion). If this
			<lb />
			pre-condition of not less than
			<lb />
			40% exists, then only the area
			<lb />
			of unirrigated land will be
			<lb />
			taken into account. This will
			<lb />
			be done by converting the
			<lb />
			unirrigated land on the basis
			<lb />
			of the conversion formula
			<lb />
			existing, into the irrigated
			<lb />
			type. The irrigated area so
			<lb />
			computed from unirrigated
			<lb />
			land shall be added to the

			actual area of irrigated land

			<lb />
			Son(s) and daughter(s) of
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) Persons having gross income
			<lb />
			of Rs.1 lakh or above or
			<lb />
			possessing wealth above the
			<lb />
			exemption limit as prescribed in
			<lb />
			the Wealth Tax Act for a period of

		<item>
			(b) Persons in Categories I, II, III
			<lb />
			and VA who are not disentitled to

			the benefit of reservation but
			<lb />
			have income from other sources

			of wealth which will bring them
			<lb />
			within the income/wealth criteria
			<lb />
			mentioned in (a) above.
			<lb />
			Explanation:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Income from salaries or
			<lb />
			agricultural land shall not be
			<lb />
			clubbed;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The income criteria in
			<lb />
			terms of rupee will be
			<lb />
			modified taking into account
			<lb />
			the change in its value every
			<lb />
			three years. If the situation,
			<lb />
			however, so demands, the
			<lb />
			interregnum may be less.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation: Wherever the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;permanent
			<lb />
			incapacitation&quot; occur in this
			<lb />
			schedule, it shall mean
			<lb />
			incapacitation which results
			<lb />
			in putting an officer out of
			<lb />
			service.

			<lb />
			Joint Secretary to the Government of India.&quot;

		<p>
			55.
			<lb />
			In sum, the schedule excludes the children of those who
			<lb />
			hold constitutional posts, e.g., the children of the President of
			<lb />
			India, Supreme Court Judges, Chairman and Members of UPSC
			<lb />
			and others are excluded. Class 1 Officers&apos; children are not
			<lb />
			eligible for OBC perks either. When both parents are Class-II
			<lb />
			Officers, their children are excluded. The same criteria that
			<lb />
			apply to Class-I and II officers apply to children of parents who
			<lb />
			work at high levels within the private sector. Agricultural owners
			<lb />
			are excluded when their irrigated holdings are more than or
			<lb />
			equal to 85% of the statutory ceiling. The O.M. further excludes
			<lb />
			persons having a gross annual income of Rs.2.5 lakh or more.
			<lb />
			The Government raised the income limit from Rs.1 to Rs.2.5 lakh
			<lb />
			on 09.03.2004 vide O.M. 36033/3/2004.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			56.
			<lb />
			The creamy layer schedule of the O.M. dated 8.9.93, in my
			<lb />
			opinion, is not comprehensive. This should be revised
			<lb />
			periodically -preferably once in every 5 years, in order to ensure
			<lb />
			that creamy layer criteria take changing circumstances into
			<lb />
			account.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			57.
			<lb />
			Apart from the people who have been excluded vide the
			<lb />
			office memo, I urge the Government to make it more
			<lb />
			comprehensive. The Government should consider excluding the
			<lb />
			children of sitting and former Members of Parliament (MP) and
			<lb />
			Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLA) from special benefits. If
			<lb />
			constitutional authorities have been excluded from benefits
			<lb />
			because of their status or resources, the same should apply to
			<lb />
			children of former and sitting MPs and MLAs. I hope the
			<lb />
			judiciary will not have to involve itself in this matter.

			2.
			<lb />
			Applying Article 21A to the Reservation Act
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			58.
			<lb />
			On 18 December 2006, in the Rajya Sabha Debate on the
			<lb />
			Reservation Act, Member of Parliament and former Governor,
			<lb />
			Dr. P.C. Alexander summed up what would become one of
			<lb />
			Petitioners&apos; arguments. Should Rs.17,000 crores be spent on
			<lb />
			implementing the Reservation Act for higher education when
			<lb />
			primary/secondary schooling is in such bad shape? Dr.
			<lb />
			Alexander stated:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			&quot;Sir, this spending Rs.17,000 crores or whatever
			<lb />
			amount is needed for adding seats in the Engineering
			<lb />
			colleges, IIMs and IITs is reversing our priorities. If
			<lb />
			you have the money for education, spend it on
			<lb />
			schools. Spend it on the rural areas for primary
			<lb />
			schools; spend it on the schools, which are poorly
			<lb />
			starved in the urban areas. Instead of doing that, you
			<lb />
			spend it by adding to the numbers because you want
			<lb />
			to appease the so-called poorer sections in the higher
			<lb />
			castes.
			<lb />
			So, we have taken care of you and you tell the
			<lb />
			backward classes we are taking care of all of you. This
			<lb />
			is where we land ourselves in trouble. We have cash
			<lb />
			resources. They should be spent where priorities are
			<lb />
			fixed clearly in our eyes and we don&apos;t want to do that.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Spending on higher at the expense of lower education raises the
			<lb />
			specter of conflict with Article 21A. By the 86th Amendment,
			<lb />
			Article 21A was inserted in our Constitution. Article 21A reads
			<lb />
			as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;The State shall provide free and compulsory
			<lb />
			education to all children of the age of six to fourteen
			<lb />
			years in such manner as the State may, by law,
			<lb />
			determine.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			59.
			<lb />
			Under Article 21A, it is a mandatory obligation of the State
			<lb />
			to provide free and compulsory education to all children aged six
			<lb />
			to fourteen. In order to achieve this constitutional mandate, the
			<lb />
			State has to place much greater emphasis on allocating more
			<lb />
			funds for primary and secondary education. There is no
			<lb />
			corresponding constitutional right to higher education. The
			<lb />
			entire Nation&apos;s progress virtually depends upon the proper and
			<lb />
			effective implementation of Article 21A.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			60.
			<lb />
			This Court in Unni Krishnan, J.P. &amp; Others v. State of
			<lb />
			Andhra Pradesh &amp; Others (1993) 1 SCC 645 para 166 held as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005 right to education is implicit in and flows from the
			<lb />
			right to life guaranteed by Article 21. That the right to
			<lb />
			education has been treated as one of transcendental
			<lb />
			importance in the life of an individual [and] has been
			<lb />
			recognized not only in this country since thousands of
			<lb />
			years, but all over the world. \005 without education
			<lb />
			being provided to citizens of this country, the
			<lb />
			objectives set forth in the Preamble to the Constitution
			<lb />
			cannot be achieved. The Constitution would fail.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			This observation encouraged the Parliament to insert Article 21A
			<lb />
			into the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			61.
			<lb />
			In Unni Krishnan (supra), Justice Reddy observed that the
			<lb />
			quality of education in Government schools was extremely poor
			<lb />
			and that the schools were woefully inadequate to the needs of the
			<lb />
			children. He noted that many countries spend 6% to 8% of
			<lb />
			Gross Domestic Product on education. Our expenditure on
			<lb />
			education is just 4% of GDP.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			62.
			<lb />
			Though an improvement over past performance, the overall
			<lb />
			education picture leaves much to be desired. The bad news is
			<lb />
			really bad. Even where we have seen improvement, there is still
			<lb />
			failure. A survey by Pratham, an NGO, fleshes out the acute
			<lb />
			problems found in rural schools. (See: ASER 2007 \026 Rural Annual
			<lb />
			Status of Education Report for 2007, published on January 16,
			<lb />
			2008). The survey covered 16,000 villages. As Pratham
			<lb />
			indicates, there are an estimated 140 million children in the age
			<lb />
			group 6 to 14 years in primary schools. Of these 30 million
			<lb />
			cannot read, 40 million can recognize a few alphabets, 40 million
			<lb />
			can read some words, and 30 million can read paragraphs. Over
			<lb />
			55 million of these children will not complete four years of
			<lb />
			school, eventually adding to the illiterate population of India. The
			<lb />
			national literacy rate is 65%.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			63.
			<lb />
			24 districts with more than 50,000 out of school children
			<lb />
			means we have failed 24 times over. 71 districts in which there
			<lb />
			are 60 students per teacher is just as bad, if not worse.
			<lb />
			According to Pratham (and in line with the Ministry of HRD&apos;s six-
			<lb />
			month review), the number of out of school children has hovered
			<lb />
			around 7,50,000. [page 6]. Moreover, it goes without saying that
			<lb />
			children need proper facilities. Today, just 59% of schools can
			<lb />
			boast of a useable toilet. [page 49].
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			64.
			<lb />
			The quality of education is equally troubling. For
			<lb />
			standards I and II, only 78.3% of students surveyed could
			<lb />
			recognize letters and read words or more in their own language.
			<lb />
			[page 47]. In 2006, it was even worse \026 only 73.1% could do so.
			<lb />
			It is disheartening to peruse the statistics for standards III to V,
			<lb />
			where only 66.4% could read Standard I text or more in their
			<lb />
			own language in 2007. [page 47]. As Pratham stated at page 7:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;What should be more worrying though, is the fact
			<lb />
			that in class 2, only 9 percent children can read the
			<lb />
			text appropriate to them, and 60 percent cannot even
			<lb />
			recognise numbers between 10 and 99.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			65.
			<lb />
			In the third to fifth standards, 40% of students surveyed
			<lb />
			could not subtract. The latest figures indicate that 58.3%
			<lb />
			children in the fifth standard read at the level appropriate for
			<lb />
			second Standard students. [page 32]. In both 2005 and 2007,
			<lb />
			only 74.1% of enrolled children were in attendance. [page 49].
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			66.
			<lb />
			The learned Solicitor General, Mr Vahanvati, submitted that
			<lb />
			the Government has now placed sufficient emphasis on primary
			<lb />
			education. In 2001-2002, the Government launched Sarva
			<lb />
			Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). This national programme&apos;s goal is to
			<lb />
			universalize elementary education. It supplements
			<lb />
			Governmental spending on education. As the Solicitor General
			<lb />
			explained, it was founded on the idea that education for those
			<lb />
			between the ages of six to fourteen is a fundamental right. In
			<lb />
			this way, SSA seeks to fulfill the Government&apos;s obligation under
			<lb />
			Article 21A to provide free and compulsory education to this age
			<lb />
			group. Some of the SSA&apos;s accomplishments merit mention.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			67.
			<lb />
			By March 2007, 2,03,577 toilets had been constructed or
			<lb />
			were under construction, covering 87% of the goal; more than six
			<lb />
			crore free textbooks had been supplied \026 96% of the goal;
			<lb />
			1,93,220 new schools had been completed or were under
			<lb />
			construction, i.e., 80% of the desired mark. The learned Solicitor
			<lb />
			General further provided that enrolment for all districts in 2004-
			<lb />
			05 for classes I-V was 11,82,96,540. In 2005-06, the number
			<lb />
			increased to 12,46,15,546. A similar increase was seen in
			<lb />
			Classes VI-VII/VIII: from 3,77,17,490 to 4,36,67,786. The total
			<lb />
			number of teachers increased from 36,67,637 in 2003-04 to
			<lb />
			46,90,176 in 2005-06.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			68.
			<lb />
			It is the learned Solicitor General&apos;s contention that SSA was
			<lb />
			responsible for many of the gains cited above. This includes the
			<lb />
			improved statistics on the student-teacher ratio, out of school
			<lb />
			children and enrollment rate for girls.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			69.
			<lb />
			While the Government is on the right track with regard to
			<lb />
			improving the infrastructure of our system, books and buildings
			<lb />
			only go so far. They are necessary but not sufficient for
			<lb />
			achieving the ultimate goals of (1) keeping children in school, (2)
			<lb />
			ensuring that they learn how to think critically and (3) ensuring
			<lb />
			that they learn skills that will help them secure gainful
			<lb />
			employment. The quality of education provided in the majority of
			<lb />
			primary schools is woeful. That is why I find it necessary to
			<lb />
			review Government spending on education \026 especially at the
			<lb />
			primary/secondary level.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			70.
			<lb />
			Undoubtedly, the Government has allocated more funds of
			<lb />
			late for education, but we need to have far more allocation of
			<lb />
			funds and much greater emphasis on free and compulsory
			<lb />
			education. Anything less would flout Article 21A&apos;s mandate.
			<lb />
			According to H.R.D. Annual Reports read with the Union of India
			<lb />
			Budget 2008-09, we spend roughly seven times as much on the
			<lb />
			individual college student than the individual primary or
			<lb />
			secondary student.

		</p>
		<p>
			71.
			<lb />
			In a country where only 18% of those in the relevant age
			<lb />
			group make it to higher education, this is incredible. See NSSO
			<lb />
			1999-2000. It is not suggested that higher education needs to
			<lb />
			be neglected or that higher education should not receive more
			<lb />
			funds, but there has to be much greater emphasis on the
			<lb />
			primary education. Our priorities have to be changed. Nothing is
			<lb />
			really more important than to ensure total compliance with
			<lb />
			Article 21A. How can a sizeable portion of the population be
			<lb />
			precluded from realizing the benefits of development when
			<lb />
			almost everyone acknowledges that the children are our future?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			72.
			<lb />
			Education for children up to the age of fourteen years
			<lb />
			should be free. This has also been suggested in the
			<lb />
			recommendations of the Kothari Commission on Education in
			<lb />
			1966. Taking the country&apos;s rampant poverty into account, free
			<lb />
			education up to the age 14 years is absolutely imperative. There
			<lb />
			is no other way for the poor to climb their way out of this
			<lb />
			predicament.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			73.
			<lb />
			Mr. P.P. Rao, learned Senior Advocate, rightly submitted
			<lb />
			that when you lack a school building, teachers, books and
			<lb />
			proper facilities, your schooling might be &quot;free&quot; but it is not an
			<lb />
			&quot;education&quot; in any proper sense. Adequate number of schools
			<lb />
			must be established with proper infrastructure without further
			<lb />
			delay. In order to achieve the constitutional goal of free and
			<lb />
			compulsory education, we have to appreciate the reality on the
			<lb />
			ground.
			<lb />
			A sizeable section of the country is still so poor that
			<lb />
			many parents are compelled to send their children to work. The
			<lb />
			State must carve out innovative policies to ensure that parents
			<lb />
			send their children to school. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme will go
			<lb />
			a long way in achieving this goal. But, apart from Mid-Day
			<lb />
			Meals, the Government should provide financial help to
			<lb />
			extremely poor parents.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			74.
			<lb />
			In addition to free education and/or other financial
			<lb />
			assistance, they should also be given books, uniforms and any
			<lb />
			other necessary benefits so that the object of Article 21A is
			<lb />
			achieved. Time and again, this Court, in a number of judgments,
			<lb />
			has observed that the State cannot avoid its constitutional
			<lb />
			obligation on the ground of financial inabilities. (See:
			<lb />
			Hussainara Khatoon &amp; Others (III) v. Home Secretary, State
			<lb />
			of Bihar, Patna (1980) 1 SCC 98, 107 at para 10).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			75.
			<lb />
			In Vasanth Kumar (supra) at para 150, Justice
			<lb />
			Venkataramiah suggested that the State provide preferential
			<lb />
			treatment such as tuition, scholarships, free boarding and
			<lb />
			lodging, etc. According to UNESCO&apos;s Education for All, Global
			<lb />
			Monitoring Report (2008) at page 115, at least fourteen countries
			<lb />
			have cash-transfer programmes that target poor households with
			<lb />
			school-age children. The largest programme is in Brazil, where
			<lb />
			46 million people receive an education transfer of up to $44 USD
			<lb />
			monthly per household in extreme poverty with children below
			<lb />
			age 16. According to the Report, the programme has reduced
			<lb />
			drop-out rates by up to 75% among beneficiaries in its more
			<lb />
			recent stage.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			76.
			<lb />
			Such a programme is not foreign to India. According to
			<lb />
			UNICEF, the State of Gujarat put the idea of financial incentives
			<lb />
			for youth into action:
			<lb />
			&quot;Figures indicate that the school enrolment drive of
			<lb />
			the state Government supported by incentives like
			<lb />
			Vidyalaxmi bond of Rs.1,000 given to each girl who
			<lb />
			completes primary education and 60 kg of wheat for
			<lb />
			tribal girls attending school, has met with significant
			<lb />
			success. In addition to the various incentives by the
			<lb />
			Government, many a corporate houses and
			<lb />
			community have also come forward to motivate
			<lb />
			parents and children by donating school bags,
			<lb />
			uniforms, stationery, etc. As a result, the drop-out
			<lb />
			rate has come down from 35.31 % in 1997-1998 to
			<lb />
			3.24% in 2006-2007 in class 1-5. In girls, this rate
			<lb />
			has dropped from 38.95% to 5.97 in the same time
			<lb />
			period.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			77.
			<lb />
			In January 2008, Haryana Chief Minister Mr. Bhupinder
			<lb />
			Singh Hooda unfurled an incentive scheme for SC students in
			<lb />
			which students would receive a one-time payment in addition to
			<lb />
			a monthly stipend for attending school. (See: &quot;Incentives
			<lb />
			announced to curb dropout rate&quot;, The Tribune, 5 Jan. 2008).
			<lb />
			The relevant portion is mentioned hereinbelow:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Secretary, education, Rajan Gupta said a one-time
			<lb />
			allowance of Rs.740 to Rs.1,450 would be given to SC
			<lb />
			students from class I to XII. \005 Under the monthly
			<lb />
			incentive scheme, boys and girls studying in class I to
			<lb />
			V would be given Rs100 and Rs.150, respectively, per
			<lb />
			month and boys and girls of class VI to VIII Rs.150
			<lb />
			and Rs.200. Similarly, boys and girls of class IX to XII
			<lb />
			would be given Rs.200 and Rs.300, respectively, and
			<lb />
			boys and girls studying science subjects in class XI
			<lb />
			and XII Rs.300 and Rs.400, respectively. \005 This
			<lb />
			monthly incentive to the students would be deposited
			<lb />
			in their bank accounts to maintain transparency in
			<lb />
			the scheme, he added.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			78.
			<lb />
			In the name of transparency, students&apos; attendance records
			<lb />
			could be made available to administrators and parents.
			<lb />
			Students would be paid to attend school. They would receive a
			<lb />
			sum for each day of school that they attended. If you only attend
			<lb />
			7 out of 10 school days, you would only receive 70% of the
			<lb />
			stipend.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			79.
			<lb />
			Ultimately, this is the most important aspect of
			<lb />
			implementing Article 21A, incentives should be provided to
			<lb />
			parents so that they are persuaded to send their children to
			<lb />
			school. More than punishment, creative incentive programmes
			<lb />
			will go a long way in the implementation of the fundamental right
			<lb />
			enshrined under Article 21A.

			<lb />
			Historical Perspective on Compulsory Education:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			80.
			<lb />
			Almost two centuries ago, Clause 43 of The Charter Act of
			<lb />
			1813 made education a State responsibility. [See: &quot;Free and
			<lb />
			Compulsory Education: Genesis and Execution of Constitutional
			<lb />
			Philosophy&quot;, Dr. P.L. Mehta and Rakhi Poonga, Deep and Deep
			<lb />
			Publications, New Delhi (1997)]. [pages 42-47]. The Hunter
			<lb />
			Commission (1882-83) was the first to recommend universal
			<lb />
			education in India. Thereafter, the Patel Bill, 1917 was the first
			<lb />
			compulsory education legislation.
			<lb />
			It proposed to make
			<lb />
			education compulsory from ages 6 to 11.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			81.
			<lb />
			The Government of India Act, 1935 provided that
			<lb />
			&quot;education should be made free and compulsory for both boys
			<lb />
			and girls.&quot; Free and compulsory education got a further boost
			<lb />
			when the Zakir Hussain Commission recommended that the
			<lb />
			State should provide it. The 1944 Sargent Report strongly
			<lb />
			recommended free and compulsory education for children aged
			<lb />
			six to fourteen. By 1947, primary education had been made
			<lb />
			compulsory in 152 urban areas and 4995 rural areas.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			82.
			<lb />
			The State has been making some endeavour to provide free
			<lb />
			and compulsory education since 1813 in one form or the other.
			<lb />
			When the original Framers gathered at the Constituent
			<lb />
			Assembly, their desire to provide free and compulsory education
			<lb />
			was well established. The real question in the Debate was
			<lb />
			whether the original Framers would make free and compulsory
			<lb />
			education justiciable or not. They oscillated between the
			<lb />
			options, first placing it in the fundamental rights and later
			<lb />
			moving it to the directive principles of State policies under Article
			<lb />
			45 of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			83.
			<lb />
			Over 50 years later, the Parliament revisited the subject.
			<lb />
			The Parliamentary debate on Article 21A offers a glimpse into the
			<lb />
			history of compulsory education in other countries. The then
			<lb />
			Minister of Human Resource Development, Dr. M.M. Joshi,
			<lb />
			referred to the speech of Shri Gopal Krishna Gokhale on
			<lb />
			compulsory education. While debating a bill in the imperial
			<lb />
			legislative council in 1911, Shri Gokhale said that in most
			<lb />
			countries:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005elementary education is both compulsory and
			<lb />
			free, and in a few, though the principle of compulsion
			<lb />
			is not strictly enforced or has not been introduced it is
			<lb />
			either wholly or for the most part gratitutious, in India
			<lb />
			alone it is neither compulsory nor free. Thus in Great
			<lb />
			Britain and Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland,
			<lb />
			Austria, Hungary, Italy, Belguim, Norway, Sweden, the
			<lb />
			United States of America, Canada, Australia and
			<lb />
			Japan it is compulsory and free. \005. In Spain,
			<lb />
			Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria, Servia and Rumania, it is
			<lb />
			free, and in theory, compulsory, though compulsion is
			<lb />
			not strictly enforced.&quot; [Lok Sabha Debates, 28
			<lb />
			November, 2001, Vol.20, page 476].

			In 1948, the United Nations made its own pronouncement
			<lb />
			on compulsory education. Article 26(1) of the Universal
			<lb />
			Declaration of Human Rights made free and compulsory
			<lb />
			education a lofty if not enforceable goal. While many states
			<lb />
			consider it an authoritative interpretation of the United Nations
			<lb />
			Charter, the Declaration is not a treaty and is not intended to be
			<lb />
			legally binding. Article 26(1) states:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Everyone has the right to education. Education shall
			<lb />
			be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental
			<lb />
			stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory.
			<lb />
			Technical and professional education shall be made
			<lb />
			generally available and higher education shall be
			<lb />
			equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			85.
			<lb />
			Our original Framers put a similar emphasis on the matter,
			<lb />
			placing free and compulsory education in the Directive
			<lb />
			Principles. The un-amended Article 45 provided that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The State shall endeavour to provide, within a
			<lb />
			period of ten years from the commencement of this
			<lb />
			Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all
			<lb />
			children until they complete the age of fourteen years.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			86.
			<lb />
			At this juncture, I deem it appropriate to refer to the
			<lb />
			Parliamentary Debate on the aspect of free and compulsory
			<lb />
			education. In the Lok Sabha debate of 28 November 2001 at Vol.
			<lb />
			20, Shri M.V.V.S. Murthi, at page 499, stated:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;Unless the Government makes primary education
			<lb />
			compulsory, no village can develop. If I say what they
			<lb />
			are doing in Andhra Pradesh, some Members may
			<lb />
			again cry foul. In Andhra Pradesh, we are having
			<lb />
			Education Committees. If there are any dropouts, the
			<lb />
			Committee will go to the village and find out the
			<lb />
			reason as to why they have dropped out. It is very
			<lb />
			important.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			87.
			<lb />
			The Report of the Kothari Commission, 1964-1966, headed
			<lb />
			by Prof. D. S. Kothari, provided important recommendations on
			<lb />
			compulsory education. Nevertheless, the circumstances of the
			<lb />
			day compelled it to soften its suggestions. The Nation was
			<lb />
			relatively poor and could not afford drastic increases in
			<lb />
			education spending. Some excerpts of this report are reproduced
			<lb />
			as under:
			<lb />

		<item>
			&quot;5.01. \005But in any given society and at a given time,
			<lb />
			the decisions regarding the type, quantity and quality
			<lb />
			of educational facilities depend partly upon the
			<lb />
			resources available and partly upon the social and
			<lb />
			political philosophy of the people. Poor and traditional
			<lb />
			societies are unable to develop even a programme of
			<lb />
			universal primary education. But rich and
			<lb />
			industrialized societies provide universal secondary
			<lb />
			education and expanding and broad-based
			<lb />
			programmes of higher and adult education. Feudal
			<lb />
			and aristocratic societies emphasize education for a
			<lb />
			few. But democratic and socialistic societies
			<lb />
			emphasize mass education and equalization of
			<lb />
			educational opportunities. The principal problem to be
			<lb />
			faced in the development of human resources,
			<lb />
			therefore, is precisely this: How can available
			<lb />
			resources be best deployed to secure the most
			<lb />
			beneficial form of educational development? How
			<lb />
			much education, of what type or level of quality,
			<lb />
			should society strive to provide and for whom?
			<lb />

		<item>
			5.03 Increasing the Educational Level of Citizens. In
			<lb />
			the next two decades the highest priority must be
			<lb />
			given to programmes aimed at raising the educational
			<lb />
			level of the average citizen. Such programmes are
			<lb />
			essential on grounds of social justice, for making
			<lb />
			democracy viable and for improving the productivity of
			<lb />
			the average worker in agriculture and industry. The
			<lb />
			most crucial of these programmes is to provide, as
			<lb />
			directed by Article 45 of the Constitution, free and
			<lb />
			compulsory education of good quality to all children
			<lb />
			up to the age of 14 years. In view of the immense
			<lb />
			human and physical resources needed, however, the
			<lb />
			implementation of this programme will have to be
			<lb />
			phased over a period of time.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			88.
			<lb />
			When Article 21A was introduced, some Members of
			<lb />
			Parliament argued that financially poor parents who fail to send
			<lb />
			their children to school should not be punished and that the
			<lb />
			word &quot;compulsion&quot; in this Article should be understood to apply
			<lb />
			exclusively to the State.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			89.
			<lb />
			Let me examine this argument. The 86th Amendment made
			<lb />
			three changes to the Constitution. It added Articles 21A and
			<lb />
			51A(k) and amended Article 45. I turn my focus to Article
			<lb />
			51A(k). In addition to rejecting an amendment that would have
			<lb />
			neutered compulsory education, the Parliament made a positive
			<lb />
			gesture. Though it never passed legislation seeking to implement
			<lb />
			compulsory education, it had not completely ignored the subject.
			<lb />
			From Article 51A(k), it becomes clear that parents would be
			<lb />
			responsible for sending their children to school. Article 51A read
			<lb />
			with 51A(k) is reproduced as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			<lb />
			&quot;It shall be the duty of every citizen of India \026 who is a
			<lb />
			parent or guardian to provide opportunities for
			<lb />
			education to his child or, as the case may be, ward
			<lb />
			between the age of six and fourteen years.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			90.
			<lb />
			Just as Article 51A(a) does not penalize disrespect of the
			<lb />
			National Flag, Article 51A(k) does not penalize parents/guardian
			<lb />
			for failing to send children to school. There is, of course,
			<lb />
			legislation that gives teeth to Article 51A(a). (See: The Prevention
			<lb />
			of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, Section 3A).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			91.
			<lb />
			Article 51A(k) indicates that it is parents, not the State, who
			<lb />
			are responsible for making sure children wake up on time and
			<lb />
			reach school. Thus, Article 21A read with Article 51A(k)
			<lb />
			distributes an obligation amongst the State and parents: the
			<lb />
			State is concerned with free education, parents with compulsory.
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding parental duty, the State also has a role to play
			<lb />
			in ensuring that compulsory education is feasible \026 a topic I will
			<lb />
			cover below.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			92.
			<lb />
			The Central Government has made some effort to fulfill its
			<lb />
			obligation under Article 21A with regard to &quot;free education.&quot;
			<lb />
			Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is one such example. When it comes to
			<lb />
			&quot;compulsory education,&quot; the Central Government has made no
			<lb />
			such effort. The Parliament has not passed any legislation. The
			<lb />
			executive has not issued any order. What we have is a
			<lb />
			patchwork of different State and Union Territory laws. These
			<lb />
			States/UTs (and NCR) include:
			<lb />
			Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhatisgarh, Goa,
			<lb />
			Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu &amp;
			<lb />
			Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,
			<lb />
			Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim,
			<lb />
			Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi,
			<lb />
			Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			93.
			<lb />
			The majority of the States and Union Territories levy very
			<lb />
			small fines on parents. I note that these laws do not go into
			<lb />
			effect with one unexcused absence. Notice is given to the
			<lb />
			parents, giving them time to remedy the problem.
			<lb />
			Of course,
			<lb />
			enforcement is almost always a different story.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			94.
			<lb />
			In contrast to the relatively light aforementioned sentences,
			<lb />
			the Compulsory Education Bill, 2006 introduced in the Rajya
			<lb />
			Sabha would provide six months imprisonment as a penalty for
			<lb />
			those who preclude children from going to school. If this Bill
			<lb />
			becomes law, Section 7 would dictate the following:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;If any person including parents of children prevents
			<lb />
			any boy or girl child from going to school or causes
			<lb />
			hindrance or obstruction in any way, he shall be
			<lb />
			punishable with imprisonment, which may extend to
			<lb />
			six months.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			95.
			<lb />
			It seems that the Bill simultaneously targets employers and
			<lb />
			parents. Employers would be punished when they hire a child to
			<lb />
			work too much or during school hours. Similarly, parents would
			<lb />
			also be punished for allowing this to happen. The Bill would also
			<lb />
			provide for scholarships, free hostel facilities and other
			<lb />
			incentives, &quot;whenever necessary&quot; and &quot;as may be prescribed&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			96.
			<lb />
			In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India &amp; Others,
			<lb />
			(1997) 10 SCC 549 at page 557 at para 11, the Court explained
			<lb />
			why education should be compulsory. In essence, a citizen is
			<lb />
			only free when he can make a meaningful challenge to his fellow
			<lb />
			citizens or Government&apos;s attempt to curtail his natural freedom.
			<lb />
			For this to happen, he needs a certain degree of education. This
			<lb />
			is why Article 21A may be the most important fundamental right.
			<lb />
			Without it, a citizen may never come to know of his other rights;
			<lb />
			nor would he have the resources to adequately enforce them.
			<lb />
			The relevant passage at para 11 reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;A free educated citizen could meaningfully exercise
			<lb />
			his political rights, discharge social responsibilities
			<lb />
			satisfactorily and develop a spirit of tolerance and
			<lb />
			reform. Therefore, education is compulsory. Primary
			<lb />
			education to the children, in particular, to the child
			<lb />
			from poor, weaker sections, Dalits and Tribes and
			<lb />
			minorities is mandatory. The basic education and
			<lb />
			employment-oriented vocational education should be
			<lb />
			imparted so as to empower the children within these
			<lb />
			segments of the society to retrieve them from poverty
			<lb />
			and, thus, develop basic abilities \005 to live a
			<lb />
			meaningful life \005 Compulsory education, therefore, to
			<lb />
			these children is one of the principal means and
			<lb />
			primary duty of the State for stability of the
			<lb />
			democracy, social integration and to eliminate social
			<lb />
			tensions.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			97.
			<lb />
			In contrast to Article 51A(k), State and Union Territory laws
			<lb />
			and Parliamentary intent with regard to Article 21A, the Court in
			<lb />
			Mukti Morcha was inclined to suggest, not hold, that the State
			<lb />
			was exclusively responsible for compulsory education. It went on
			<lb />
			to reaffirm M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Others (child
			<lb />
			labour matter) (1996) 6 SCC 756. In that case, the Court took
			<lb />
			up the issue of child labour in hazardous fields when it learnt of
			<lb />
			an accident in a cracker factory in Sivakasi.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			98.
			<lb />
			The said case at para 28 identified poverty as the root cause
			<lb />
			of child labour:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Of the aforesaid causes, it seems to us that \005 poverty
			<lb />
			is basic reason which compels parents of a child,
			<lb />
			despite their unwillingness, to get it employed. The
			<lb />
			Survey Report of the Ministry of Labour (supra) had
			<lb />
			also stated so. Otherwise, no parents, specially no
			<lb />
			mother, would like that a tender-aged child should toil
			<lb />
			in a factory in a difficult condition, instead of its
			<lb />
			enjoying its childhood at home under the paternal
			<lb />
			gaze.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			99.
			<lb />
			In other words, parents send children to work because
			<lb />
			parents have no other choice. Food comes first. If the State does
			<lb />
			not provide extra income so as to remove the incentive to send
			<lb />
			children to work, it is wasting its time on mere gesture. The
			<lb />
			Court in para 29 concluded that action must be taken:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;It may be that [child labour] would be taken care of to
			<lb />
			some extent by insisting on compulsory education.
			<lb />
			Indeed, Neera [Burns] thinks that if there is at all a
			<lb />
			blueprint for tackling the problem of child labour, it is
			<lb />
			education. Even if it were to be so, the child of a poor
			<lb />
			parent would not receive education, if per force it has
			<lb />
			to earn to make the family meet both the ends.
			<lb />
			Therefore, unless the family is assured of income
			<lb />
			aliunde, problem of child labour would hardly get
			<lb />
			solved; and it is this vital question which has
			<lb />
			remained almost unattended. We are, however, of the
			<lb />
			view that till an alternative income is assured to the
			<lb />
			family, the question of abolition of child labour would
			<lb />
			really remain will-o&apos;-the-wisp.&quot; (emphasis added).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			100.
			<lb />
			It is interesting to note that compulsory education has been
			<lb />
			introduced in one form or the other in various countries. From
			<lb />
			the historical experience of these nations, we learn that the
			<lb />
			legislation pertaining to compulsory education has played an
			<lb />
			important role in improving educational outcomes.

			101.
			<lb />
			Compulsory education has had a long history outside of
			<lb />
			India. In 1852, the State of Massachusetts enacted the first
			<lb />
			compulsory attendance law in the United States; though
			<lb />
			compulsory education laws existed much earlier in many states,
			<lb />
			the first dating back to 1642 in Massachusetts. &quot;Were
			<lb />
			Compulsory Attendance and Child Labor Laws Effective? (See:

		</item>

		<p>
			102.
			<lb />
			Prof. Lleras-Muney explains that those who advocated
			<lb />
			for compulsory education believed that universal education was
			<lb />
			necessary to promote democracy and guarantee a common
			<lb />
			American culture. (Page 11). Given the influx of immigrants,
			<lb />
			some of whom came from undemocratic countries, many
			<lb />
			supporters of legislation viewed compulsory education as an
			<lb />
			instrument for assimilation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			103.
			<lb />
			Other reasons cited by compulsory education proponents in
			<lb />
			the United States included the reduction of crime, racism and
			<lb />
			inequality. Prof. Oreopoulos of the University of Toronto cites to
			<lb />
			sources that make it appear as though the reasons for adopting
			<lb />
			compulsory education in Canada mirrored those cited in the
			<lb />
			United States: the emphasis was on good citizenship and
			<lb />
			economic development:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;Archibald Macallum, an Ontario teacher,
			<lb />
			summarized the latter argument vigorously in an 1875
			<lb />
			report favouring the introduction of compulsory
			<lb />
			schooling in Canada: &apos;Society has suffered so cruelly
			<lb />
			from ignorance, that its riddance is a matter of
			<lb />
			necessity, and by the universal diffusion of knowledge
			<lb />
			alone can ignorance and crime be banished from our
			<lb />
			midst; in no other way can the best interests of society
			<lb />
			be conserved and improved than by this one remedy \026

			right of every Canadian child to receive that education
			<lb />
			that will make him a good, loyal subject, prepared to
			<lb />
			serve his country in the various social functions which
			<lb />
			he may be called on to fill during his life; and prepare
			<lb />
			him, through grace, for the life to come&apos; (Annual
			<lb />
			Report of the Ontario Teachers&apos; Association, 1875, as
			<lb />
			cited in Prentice and Houston 1975, 175\0266). (See: The

			7 Empirical data indicating that compulsory
			<lb />
			education has a positive effect:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			104. Prof. Oreopoulos provides data that show the fruits of
			<lb />
			imposing education on citizens. Crime may be lowered, health
			<lb />

			<lb />
			improved and civic activity increased. Compulsory education
			<lb />
			may also lead to a substantial increase in income for individuals.
			<lb />
			Moreover, compulsory education, if it does not cause, may at
			<lb />
			least contribute to an increase in bilingualism and employment
			<lb />
			and a reduction in poverty. The relevant portion is reproduced
			<lb />
			hereunder:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;(Page 24). Other papers find evidence of social
			<lb />
			returns, but for non-pecuniary outcomes. Lochner and
			<lb />
			Moretti (2002), for example, find that compulsory
			<lb />
			schooling lowers crime, while Lleras-Muney (2002)
			<lb />
			finds a correlation with improved health. In studies of
			<lb />
			the United States and United Kingdom, Dee (2003)
			<lb />
			and Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopoulos (2003) estimate
			<lb />
			that tighter restrictions on leaving school early
			<lb />
			correspond to increased levels of civic activity (like
			<lb />
			voting and discussing politics). \005 My analysis
			<lb />
			suggests that students compelled to complete an extra
			<lb />
			grade of school have historically experienced an
			<lb />
			average increase of 9\02615% in annual income.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(Page 48).
			<lb />
			I find that the introduction of tighter
			<lb />
			provincial restrictions on leaving school between 1920
			<lb />
			and 1990 raised average grade attainment and
			<lb />
			incomes. Students compelled to attend an extra year
			<lb />
			of school experienced an average increase in annual
			<lb />
			income of about 12%. I also find that compulsory
			<lb />
			schooling is associated with significant benefits in
			<lb />
			terms of other socio-economic outcome measures
			<lb />
			ranging from bilingualism, employment, and poverty
			<lb />
			status. These results hold up against many
			<lb />
			specifications checks and are entirely consistent with
			<lb />
			previous studies.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			105.
			<lb />
			In addition to increased income, Prof. Lleras-Muney found
			<lb />
			that legally requiring a child to attend school for one more year
			<lb />
			increased educational attainment by roughly five percentage
			<lb />
			points. (Page 8). Educational attainment refers to time spent in
			<lb />
			school.

			<lb />
			The causes of low enrolment, high drop-out rates and
			<lb />
			frequent truancy in the U.S. and India differ, but the
			<lb />
			consequences thereof do not. In either case, citizens who lack
			<lb />
			education are at an extreme disadvantage. In India, poverty has
			<lb />
			been identified as the ultimate cause of lackluster enrolment and
			<lb />
			attendance rates. Children are compelled to work. In developed
			<lb />
			countries like the United States or Canada, children rarely fail to
			<lb />
			attend school because of economic constraints. Instead, a
			<lb />
			number of different factors may contribute to truancy. High
			<lb />
			school students may drop out &quot;\005 because they detest school,
			<lb />
			lack motivation, or anticipate little reward from graduation.&quot;
			<lb />
			(See: The Canadian Journal of Economics, &quot;The compelling effects
			<lb />
			of compulsory schooling: the evidence from Canada,&quot; Prof.
			<lb />
			Oreopoulos, p. 23, (quoting from Eckstein, Zvi, and Kenneth I.
			<lb />
			Wolpin (1999) &quot;Why youths drop out of high school: the impact of
			<lb />
			preferences, opportunities, and abilities,&quot; Econometrica 67, 1295\026
			<lb />
			339).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			107.
			<lb />
			As I detail below, students and parents in the United States
			<lb />
			often face the same fines when students fail to attend school.
			<lb />
			Fines for students make more sense when low self-control is the
			<lb />
			reason for which they fail to attend school. At the same time,
			<lb />
			punishing Indian students who have no choice but to work
			<lb />
			would make no sense. Such a punishment should not be
			<lb />
			borrowed from the United States.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			108.
			<lb />
			In many jurisdictions in the United States, the attendance
			<lb />
			officer is responsible for enforcing compulsory attendance laws
			<lb />
			for his area or school. Given the overwhelming problem of sub-
			<lb />
			par enrolment and attendance in India, we doubt that one school
			<lb />
			official could sufficiently do the work of inspecting places of
			<lb />
			employment for children who have violated attendance laws.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			109.
			<lb />
			Indeed, existing legislation in India already envisages the
			<lb />
			employment of attendance officers. The Delhi Primary Education
			<lb />
			Act, 1960, Sec. 7. Yet, there is nothing to suggest that these
			<lb />
			employees have adequately dealt with truancy. As mentioned,
			<lb />
			this is, in part, due to the economic conditions in which many
			<lb />
			parents find themselves. Financial assistance or incentives must
			<lb />
			be given. Only then, may the Government actively enforce
			<lb />
			compulsory attendance legislation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			110.
			<lb />
			We must also remember that it is not only the child who
			<lb />
			fails to attend but also the child who fails to enroll that has
			<lb />
			violated an attendance law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			111.
			<lb />
			Before taking issue with State/Union Territory compulsory
			<lb />
			education statutes, I note that education has traditionally been
			<lb />
			reserved for the States. Only in 1976, vide the 42nd Amendment
			<lb />
			of the Constitution, did education become a part of Concurrent
			<lb />
			List of Schedule 7. In its 165th Report, the Law Commission of
			<lb />
			India has also recommended enactment of Central Legislation in
			<lb />
			this respect. Putting education in the Concurrent List turns out
			<lb />
			to be a positive development, given the States&apos; failure to provide
			<lb />
			effective legislation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			112.
			<lb />
			The States&apos; laws fail on two accounts. First, they are too
			<lb />
			lenient to have a deterrent effect. Second, the legislation is not
			<lb />
			adequately enforced, in part, because it does not require police
			<lb />
			officers to do the job. If we analyze the legislation passed by
			<lb />
			different States, another conclusion becomes obvious: no State
			<lb />
			has provided for an adequate punishment whose effect would be
			<lb />
			to deter citizens from committing a violation.

			<lb />
			It is necessary to reproduce some of the various compulsory
			<lb />
			education laws of the States.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			114.
			<lb />
			Under Section 7 of The Tamil Nadu Compulsory Elementary
			<lb />
			Education Act, 1994:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Every parent or guardian of a child of school age who
			<lb />
			fails to discharge his duty under section 4 [duty of
			<lb />
			parent to cause child to attend elementary school]
			<lb />
			shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one
			<lb />
			hundred rupees.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			115.
			<lb />
			Section 18(1) of The Delhi Primary Education Act, 1960
			<lb />
			states:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;If any parent fails to comply with an attendance order
			<lb />
			passed under Section 13, he shall be punishable with
			<lb />
			fine not exceeding two rupees, and, in the case of
			<lb />
			continuing contravention, with an additional fine not
			<lb />
			exceeding fifty naye paise for every day during which
			<lb />
			such contravention continues after conviction for the
			<lb />
			first of such contraventions. Provided that the
			<lb />
			amount of fine payable by any one person in respect of
			<lb />
			any child in any one year shall not exceed fifty
			<lb />
			rupees.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			116.
			<lb />
			Analysis of these State laws reveals that they are weak in
			<lb />
			character and perhaps have never been implemented. If we
			<lb />
			compare these laws with their sister statutes in United States,
			<lb />
			we realize that the U.S. laws are far stronger.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			117.
			<lb />
			In Wisconsin, parents who fail to send their children to
			<lb />
			school may have to pay a fine of not more than $500 or face
			<lb />
			imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both. [Wisconsin
			<lb />
			Statute Sections 118.15(1)(a) and 118.15(5)(a)1.a]. For a second
			<lb />
			or subsequent offense, they may face a fine of not more than
			<lb />
			$1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both.
			<lb />
			[Wisconsin Statute Sections 118.15(1)(a) and 118.15(5)(a)1.b].
			<lb />
			Alternatively, they may be sentenced to perform community
			<lb />
			service. [Wisconsin Statute Sections 118.15(1)(a) and
			<lb />
			118.15(5)(a)2] .
			<lb />
			Unlike Wisconsin, Tamil Nadu and Delhi&apos;s laws have no
			<lb />
			teeth.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			118.
			<lb />
			The other main problem is implementation of these laws.
			<lb />
			Neither the State Governments nor their police agencies are at all
			<lb />
			serious about implementing these compulsory laws. There are
			<lb />
			hardly any cases where even fines have been imposed.
			<lb />
			Some
			<lb />
			form of compulsory education has been on the statute books
			<lb />
			since 1917. We have seen Western countries enforce these laws.
			<lb />
			Most Western countries enjoy almost universal literacy while
			<lb />
			35% of our population is illiterate. While a robust financial
			<lb />
			incentive programme may not have been possible in 1917, it is
			<lb />
			today. If we wish to develop further, we must educate each and
			<lb />
			every citizen aged six to fourteen.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			119.
			<lb />
			In order to give effect to the constitutional right under
			<lb />
			Article 21A, it is imperative that the Central Government pass
			<lb />
			suitable legislation. The fine should be suitably increased.
			<lb />
			Imprisonment should be a sentencing option as well. The
			<lb />
			current patchwork of State/UT legislation on compulsory
			<lb />
			education is insufficient. Small monetary fines do not go far
			<lb />
			enough to ensure the implementation of Article 21A.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			120.
			<lb />
			A disclaimer is attached to these recommendations.
			<lb />
			The recommendations for the enforcement of compulsory
			<lb />
			education are contingent upon the implementation of a financial
			<lb />
			incentive program that would make education viable for the poor.
			<lb />
			The carrot must come before the stick. If there is no financial
			<lb />
			incentive program in place, the Government cannot expect the
			<lb />
			poorest of the poor to send their children to school.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			121.
			<lb />
			The Parliament should criminally penalize those parents
			<lb />
			who receive financial benefits and, despite such payments, send
			<lb />
			their children to work and penalize those employers who
			<lb />
			preclude children from attending school or completing
			<lb />
			homework. It has become necessary that the Government set a
			<lb />
			realistic target within which it must fully implement Article 21A
			<lb />
			regarding free and compulsory education for the entire country.
			<lb />
			The Government should suitably revise budget allocations for
			<lb />
			education. The priorities have to be set correctly. The most
			<lb />
			important fundamental right may be Article 21A, which, in the
			<lb />
			larger interest of the nation, must be fully implemented. Without
			<lb />
			Article 21A, the other fundamental rights are effectively rendered
			<lb />
			meaningless. Education stands above other rights, as one&apos;s
			<lb />
			ability to enforce one&apos;s fundamental rights flows from one&apos;s
			<lb />
			education. This is ultimately why the judiciary must oversee
			<lb />
			Government spending on free and compulsory education.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			122.
			<lb />
			At the same time, spending is an area in which the
			<lb />
			judiciary must not overstep its constitutional mandate. The
			<lb />
			power of the purse is found in Part V, Chapter II of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, which is dedicated to the Parliament. (See: Articles
			<lb />
			109 and 117 for &quot;Money Bills.&quot;) Nevertheless, it remains within
			<lb />
			the judiciary&apos;s scope to ensure that the fundamental right under
			<lb />
			Article 21A of Part III is upheld. In M.C. Mehta v. Union of
			<lb />
			India (vehicular pollution) (1998) 6 SCC 63, this Court did not
			<lb />
			ignore the Article 21 right to life when deadly levels of pollution
			<lb />
			put the right at stake. Nor will this Court ignore the Article 21A
			<lb />
			right to education, when a dearth of quality schooling put it in
			<lb />
			jeopardy. The Government&apos;s education programmes and
			<lb />
			expenditures, wanting in many respects, are an improvement
			<lb />
			over past performance. They nearly fall short of the
			<lb />
			constitutional mark. Lackluster performance in
			<lb />
			primary/secondary schools is caused in part because
			<lb />
			Government places college students on a higher pedestal. Money
			<lb />
			will not solve all our education woes, but a correction of priorities
			<lb />
			in step with the Constitution&apos;s mandate will go a long way.

			<lb />
			Opposition to Compulsory Education
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			123.
			<lb />
			&quot;Compulsory&quot; connotes enforcement. The Parliament
			<lb />
			rejected an amendment that would have saved parents from
			<lb />
			penal penalties. If education were not compulsory, who checks in
			<lb />
			with parents who have sent their children to work? If no
			<lb />
			authorities inquire, the message is clear: We, the State, do not
			<lb />
			care if your child goes to school. Taking the opposing view, Shri
			<lb />
			G.M. Banatwalla wanted to make sure parents were not
			<lb />
			punished:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005this word &apos;compulsion&apos; needs to be properly defined.
			<lb />
			The word, &apos;compulsion&apos; is not to be related to the
			<lb />
			student or the parents. Parents cannot be penalized
			<lb />
			for being too poor to send their children to school.
			<lb />
			The word, &apos;compulsion&apos; has to be understood in
			<lb />
			relation to the State and the obligation of the State to
			<lb />
			provide for free education. p. 523.&quot; (See: The
			<lb />
			Parliamentary Debates on Article 21A, p. 523, 28
			<lb />
			November 2001 at Vol. 20, No. 6-10)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			124.
			<lb />
			The Parliament had the opportunity to accept such a
			<lb />
			definition of &quot;compulsory.&quot; But they chose otherwise.
			<lb />
			Amendment number four, moved by Shri G.M. Banatwalla at p.
			<lb />
			548, stated that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Provided that in making any law to provide for free
			<lb />
			and compulsory education under this article, the State
			<lb />
			shall not\005 (b) enforce any penal sanctions on a parent
			<lb />
			or guardian.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			125.
			<lb />
			Of paramount importance, this Amendment was
			<lb />
			&quot;negatived.&quot; [See p. 548]. Those who wanted a safe-haven from
			<lb />
			penal sanction for parents lost. From this vote, we know that the
			<lb />
			Parliament intended to allow for future legislation that would
			<lb />
			impose penal sanctions for violations of legislation under Article
			<lb />
			21A.
			<lb />
		</p>

			<lb />
			Conclusion on Free and Compulsory Education
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			126.
			<lb />
			Given that so many children drop out of, or are absent
			<lb />
			from, school before they turn fourteen, &quot;free education&quot; alone
			<lb />
			cannot solve the problem. The current patchwork of laws on
			<lb />
			compulsory education is insufficient. Monetary fines do not go
			<lb />
			far enough to ensure that Article 21A is upheld.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			127.
			<lb />
			A carrot-and-stick approach appears to be the best way to
			<lb />
			implement Article 21A. Financial incentive programmes have
			<lb />
			worked well in other countries. We should follow their lead.
			<lb />
			Once that is done, the Government should strictly enforce
			<lb />
			effective compulsory education laws. Such a policy is bound to
			<lb />
			pay off.
			<lb />
			In sum, the Central Government should enact legislation
			<lb />
			that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(a)
			<lb />
			provides low-income parents/guardians with
			<lb />
			financial incentives such that they may afford to
			<lb />
			send their children to school;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			criminally penalizes those who receive financial
			<lb />
			incentives and despite such payment send their
			<lb />
			children to work;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c)
			<lb />
			penalizes employers who preclude children from
			<lb />
			attending school or completing homework;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d)
			<lb />
			the penalty should include imprisonment; the
			<lb />
			aforementioned Bill would serve as an example.
			<lb />
			The State is obligated under Article 21A to
			<lb />
			implement free and compulsory education in toto;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(e)
			<lb />
			Until we have achieved the object of free and
			<lb />
			compulsory education, the Government should
			<lb />
			continue to increase the education budget;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(f)
			<lb />
			the Parliament should set a deadline by which
			<lb />
			time free and compulsory education will have
			<lb />
			reached every child. This must be done within
			<lb />
			six months.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			128.
			<lb />
			With regard to (a), the state cannot cite budgetary
			<lb />
			constraints or lack of resources as an excuse for failing to
			<lb />
			provide financial assistance/incentives to poor parents. See
			<lb />
			Hussainara Khatoon (supra), at page 107, para 10.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			129.
			<lb />
			Article 21A&apos;s reference to &quot;education&quot; must mean
			<lb />
			something. This conclusion is bolstered by the Parliament&apos;s
			<lb />
			Statement of Objects and Reasons for Article 21A:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The Constitution of India in a Directive Principle
			<lb />
			contained in article 45, has made a provision for free
			<lb />
			and compulsory education for all children up to the
			<lb />
			age of fourteen years within ten years of promulgation
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. We could not achieve this goal
			<lb />
			even after 50 years of adoption of this provision. The
			<lb />
			task of providing education to all children in this age
			<lb />
			group gained momentum after the National Policy of
			<lb />
			Education (NPE) was announced in 1986. The
			<lb />
			Government of India, in partnership with the State
			<lb />
			Governments, has made strenuous efforts to fulfill this
			<lb />
			mandate and, though significant improvements were
			<lb />
			seen in various educational indicators, the ultimate
			<lb />
			goal of providing universal and quality education still
			<lb />
			remains unfulfilled. In order to fulfill this goal, it is
			<lb />
			felt that an explicit provision should be made in the
			<lb />
			Part relating to Fundamental Rights of the
			<lb />
			Constitution.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			1.
			<lb />
			With a view to making right to free and
			<lb />
			compulsory education a fundamental right, the
			<lb />
			Constitution (Eighty-third Amendment) Bill, 1997 was
			<lb />
			introduced in the Parliament to insert a new article,
			<lb />
			namely, article 21A conferring on all children in the
			<lb />
			age group of 6 to 14 years the right to free and
			<lb />
			compulsory education. The said Bill was scrutinized
			<lb />
			by the Parliament Standing Committee on Human
			<lb />
			Resource Development and the subject was also dealt
			<lb />
			with in its 165th Report by the Law Commission of
			<lb />
			India.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			2.
			<lb />
			After taking into consideration the report of the
			<lb />
			Law Commission of India and the recommendations of
			<lb />
			the Standing Committee of the Parliament, the
			<lb />
			proposed amendments in Part III, Part IV and Part IVA
			<lb />
			of the Constitution are being made which are as
			<lb />
			follows \005
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			130.
			<lb />
			The Article seeks to usher in &quot;the ultimate goal of providing
			<lb />
			universal and quality education.&quot; (emphasis supplied). Implied
			<lb />
			within &quot;education&quot; is the idea that it will be quality in nature.
			<lb />
			Current performance indicates that much improvement needs to
			<lb />
			be made before we qualify &quot;education&quot; with &quot;quality.&quot; Of course,
			<lb />
			for children who are out school, even the best education would
			<lb />
			be irrelevant. It goes without saying that all children aged six to
			<lb />
			fourteen must attend school and education must be quality in
			<lb />
			nature. Only upon accomplishing both of these goals, can we say
			<lb />
			that we have achieved total compliance with Article 21A.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			131.
			<lb />
			Though progress has been made, the Parliament&apos;s
			<lb />
			observation upon passing Art 21A still applies: the goal of
			<lb />
			providing universal and quality education &quot;\005 still remains
			<lb />
			unfulfilled.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			3.
			<lb />
			Does the 93rd Amendment violate the Basic
			<lb />
			Structure of the Constitution by imposing
			<lb />
			reservation on unaided institutions?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			132.
			<lb />
			Imposing reservation on unaided institutions violates the
			<lb />
			basic structure by obliterating citizens&apos; 19(1)(g) right to carry on
			<lb />
			an occupation. Unaided entities, whether they are educational
			<lb />
			institutions or private corporations, cannot be regulated out of
			<lb />
			existence when they are providing a public service like education.
			<lb />
			That is what reservation would do. That is an unreasonable
			<lb />
			restriction. When you do not take a single paisa of public money,
			<lb />
			you cannot be subjected to such restriction. The 93rd
			<lb />
			Amendment&apos;s reference to unaided institutions must be severed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			133.
			<lb />
			No unaided institution filed a writ petition in this case. Had
			<lb />
			either this Court or respondents had an objection, they could
			<lb />
			have raised it at any time during the proceedings. We listened to
			<lb />
			the parties for months. We received voluminous written
			<lb />
			submissions from the parties, yet no objection was made with
			<lb />
			regard to the fact that no unaided institution had filed a writ
			<lb />
			petition. While we would usually implead a party if we felt their
			<lb />
			presence was necessary to the resolution of the dispute, the facts
			<lb />
			of this case are peculiar. The best lawyers in the country argued
			<lb />
			the case for both sides, and a brief from an unaided institution
			<lb />
			would not have added much if anything to the substance of the
			<lb />
			arguments. The Government will likely target unaided
			<lb />
			institutions in the future. At that time, this Court will have to go
			<lb />
			through this entire exercise de novo to determine if unaided
			<lb />
			institutions should be subject to reservation. Such an exercise
			<lb />
			would unnecessarily cause further delay. The fate of lakhs of
			<lb />
			students and thousands of institutions would remain up in the
			<lb />
			air. (See: Minerva Mills Ltd. &amp; Others v. Union of India &amp;
			<lb />
			Others (1980) 3 SCC 625). Therefore, looking to the
			<lb />
			extraordinary facts, I have decided to proceed with this aspect of
			<lb />
			the matter in the larger public interest.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			134.
			<lb />
			Amendments by their very nature are often enabling
			<lb />
			provisions. If they clear the way for future legislation that would
			<lb />
			in fact violate the basic structure, the Court need not wait for a
			<lb />
			potential violation to become an actual one. It can strike the
			<lb />
			entire amendment ab initio. The question of potential width was
			<lb />
			resolved in Minerva Mills (supra), paras 38-39.
			<lb />
			The Court
			<lb />
			acknowledged that it generally does not anticipate constitutional
			<lb />
			issues before they arise, but it held that circumstances required
			<lb />
			it to act before unconstitutional provisions could be passed
			<lb />
			under the authority of an unconstitutional amendment.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;38. But, we find it difficult to uphold the preliminary
			<lb />
			objection because, the question raised by the
			<lb />
			petitioners as regards constitutionality of Sections 4
			<lb />
			and 55 of the 42nd Amendment is not an academic or a
			<lb />
			hypothetical question. The 42nd Amendment is there
			<lb />
			for anyone to see and by its Sections 4 and 55
			<lb />
			amendments have been made to Articles 31-C and 368
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. An order has been passed against
			<lb />
			the petitioners under Section 18-A of the Industries
			<lb />
			(Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, by which the
			<lb />
			petitioners are aggrieved.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;39. Besides there are two other relevant
			<lb />
			considerations which must be taken into account
			<lb />
			while dealing with the preliminary objection. There is
			<lb />
			no constitutional or statutory inhibition against the
			<lb />
			decision of questions before they actually arise for
			<lb />
			consideration. In view of the importance of the
			<lb />
			question raised and in view of the fact that the
			<lb />
			question has been raised in many a petition, it is
			<lb />
			expedient in the interest of justice to settle the
			<lb />
			true position. Secondly, what we are dealing with is
			<lb />
			not an ordinary law which may or may not be passed
			<lb />
			so that it could be said that our jurisdiction is being
			<lb />
			invoked on the hypothetical consideration that a law
			<lb />
			may be passed in future which will injure the rights of
			<lb />
			the petitioners. We are dealing with a constitutional
			<lb />
			amendment which has been brought into operation
			<lb />
			which, of its own force, permits the violation of certain
			<lb />
			freedoms through laws passed for certain purposes.
			<lb />
			We, therefore, overrule the preliminary objection and
			<lb />
			proceed to determine the point raised by the
			<lb />
			petitioners.&quot;
			<lb />
			[emphasis added]
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			There is not one precise definition of the width test, however. The
			<lb />
			test asks if an amendment is so wide that in effect (actual or
			<lb />
			potential), it goes beyond the Parliament&apos;s amending power.
			<lb />
			Kesavananda, paras 531-532: &quot;But that the real consequences
			<lb />
			can be taken into account while judging the width of the power is
			<lb />
			settled. The Court cannot ignore the consequences to which a
			<lb />
			particular construction can lead \005&quot; To make such a
			<lb />
			determination, it follows that the Court should ask whether an
			<lb />
			amendment infringes constitutional limitations as opposed to
			<lb />
			those evolved from mere common law. (See: Nagaraj, para 103).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			135.
			<lb />
			As a preliminary matter, I turn to the cases by which the
			<lb />
			basic structure doctrine has been established. It has been stated
			<lb />
			that, &quot;Kesavananda had propounded the doctrine, the Indira
			<lb />
			Gandhi Election case had upheld it, and Minerva engraved it on
			<lb />
			stone.&quot; (See: Granville Austin, &quot;Working a Democratic
			<lb />
			Constitution&quot;, at page 506].
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			136.
			<lb />
			Kesavananda and its progeny provide that an amendment
			<lb />
			to the Constitution must not alter the Constitution&apos;s basic
			<lb />
			structure. To reach a conclusion regarding a basic structure
			<lb />
			challenge, I employ the following general standard: an
			<lb />
			amendment alters the basic structure if its actual or potential
			<lb />
			effect would be to damage a facet of the basic structure to such an
			<lb />
			extent that the facet&apos;s original identity is compromised.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			137.
			<lb />
			To determine if legislation infringes constitutional
			<lb />
			limitations and is thus invalid, we use the two-step effect test
			<lb />
			(also known as the impact or rights test). Step One requires us
			<lb />
			to first ask if legislation affects a facet of the basic structure.
			<lb />
			If it does, then at Step Two we ask if the effect on the facet
			<lb />
			of the structure is to such an extent that the facet&apos;s original
			<lb />
			identity has been altered. Applying the effect test is another way
			<lb />
			of saying that the form of an amendment is irrelevant; it is the
			<lb />
			consequence thereof that matters. (See: Kesavanda at para 532
			<lb />
			and I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamilnadu (2007) 2 SCC 1 at
			<lb />
			Conclusion (ii) at page 111).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			138.
			<lb />
			The terms &quot;abridge&quot; and &quot;abrogate&quot; have been employed by
			<lb />
			this Court to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable
			<lb />
			legislation. Whether legislation abridges or abrogates is a
			<lb />
			question of degree. Using these terms is another way of asking
			<lb />
			whether the legislation had such an effect that it changed the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution. If legislation merely abridges
			<lb />
			the basic structure, the structure&apos;s identity remains. The
			<lb />
			legislation is upheld. In this sense, the Parliament may take
			<lb />
			away or destroy fundamental rights by amending the
			<lb />
			Constitution, provided that the basic structure is not altered.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			139.
			<lb />
			If it abrogates the basic structure, the structure and thus
			<lb />
			the Constitution lose their identities. The legislation must be
			<lb />
			struck down. This is determined on a case-by-case basis by
			<lb />
			applying the effect test (impact/rights tests). (See: Coehlo). I
			<lb />
			further note that a total deprivation of fundamental rights, even
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Step One: Does Article 15(5) affect a facet of the
			<lb />
			basic structure?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			140.
			<lb />
			In the instant case, Article 15(5) expressly precludes the
			<lb />
			application of Article 19(1)(g). Whenever reservations are
			<lb />
			implemented under Article 15(5), citizens are stripped of their
			<lb />
			fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(g). By excluding Article
			<lb />
			19(1)(g), Article 15(5) obviously affects Article 19(1)(g), a facet of
			<lb />
			the basic structure of the Constitution. Step One is therefore
			<lb />
			cleared. What is more, Article 19(1)(g) belongs to the Golden
			<lb />
			Triangle \026 Articles 14, 19 and 21 are the three fundamental
			<lb />
			rights that stand above the rest. Writing for the majority in
			<lb />
			Minerva Mills, Justice Chandrachud provides an eloquent
			<lb />
			justification for shielding the Golden Triangle from attack. To
			<lb />
			achieve a more egalitarian society, individual liberty must be
			<lb />
			protected:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Para 74 of Minerva Mills: Three Articles of our
			<lb />
			Constitution, and only three, stand between the
			<lb />
			heaven of freedom into which Tagore wanted his
			<lb />
			country to awake and the abyss of unrestrained
			<lb />
			power. They are Articles 14, 19 and 21. Article 31C
			<lb />
			has removed two sides of that golden triangle which
			<lb />
			affords to the people of this country an assurance that
			<lb />
			the promise held forth by the Preamble will be
			<lb />
			performed by ushering an egalitarian era through the
			<lb />
			discipline of fundamental rights, that is, without
			<lb />
			emasculation of the rights to liberty and equality
			<lb />
			which alone can help preserve the dignity of the
			<lb />
			individual.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			141.
			<lb />
			The Golden Triangle&apos;s significance becomes clear when we
			<lb />
			consider that Government may suspend Article 14 and 19 rights
			<lb />
			in order to implement an emergency. (See: Articles 358 and 359)
			<lb />
			(prior to the 44th Amendment, all Part III rights could be
			<lb />
			curtailed during emergency; this Amendment precludes the State
			<lb />
			from denying Articles 20 and 21 to citizens during emergency).
			<lb />
			In a sense, democracy is only restored when the Triangle is
			<lb />
			returned to the citizens. Without the Triangle, democracy is
			<lb />
			impossible:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;para 63\005 Every State is goal-oriented and claims to
			<lb />
			strive for securing the welfare of its people. The
			<lb />
			distinction between the different forms of Government
			<lb />
			consists in that a real democracy will endeavour to
			<lb />
			achieve its objectives through the discipline of
			<lb />
			fundamental freedoms like those conferred by Articles
			<lb />
			14 and 19. Those are the most elementary
			<lb />
			freedoms without which a free democracy is
			<lb />
			impossible and which must therefore be preserved
			<lb />
			at all costs. Besides, as observed by Brandies, J., the
			<lb />
			need to protect liberty is the greatest when
			<lb />
			Government&apos;s purposes are beneficent. If the
			<lb />
			discipline of Article 14 is withdrawn and if immunity
			<lb />
			from the operation of that article is conferred, not only
			<lb />
			on laws passed by the Parliament but on laws passed
			<lb />
			by the State Legislatures also, the political pressures
			<lb />
			exercised by numerically large groups can tear the
			<lb />
			country asunder by leaving it to the legislature to pick
			<lb />
			and choose favoured areas and favourite classes for
			<lb />
			preferential treatment.&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
			United States Supreme Court Justice Brandeis&apos; word of
			<lb />
			caution is relevant to today&apos;s dispute wherein the Government
			<lb />
			trumpets reservation in higher education as an answer to our
			<lb />
			age-old problems of poverty and caste. At first blush, it sounds
			<lb />
			as if reservation in higher education would help the backward
			<lb />
			help themselves. The road out of poverty is paved with
			<lb />
			education. However, the &quot;devil is the details.&quot; With elementary
			<lb />
			freedom on the line, I must carefully scrutinize those details.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			143.
			<lb />
			The right to freedom under Article 19 has been long
			<lb />
			recognized as a natural and inalienable right that belongs to all
			<lb />
			citizens. Indeed, what would Independence mean without it?
			<lb />
			Chief Justice Sikri cites the following passage in Kesavananda
			<lb />
			at para 300:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;That article (Article 19) enumerates certain freedoms
			<lb />
			under the caption &quot;right to freedom&quot; and deals with
			<lb />
			those great and basic rights which are recognised and
			<lb />
			guaranteed as the natural rights inherent in the status
			<lb />
			of a citizen of a free country.&quot; (Per Patanjali Sastri,
			<lb />
			C.J., in State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose
			<lb />
			[1954] S.C.R. 587, 596).&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			144.
			<lb />
			With fundamental rights in jeopardy, I shall review the
			<lb />
			cases in which the basic structure doctrine has been
			<lb />
			implemented to invalidate constitutional amendments. By
			<lb />
			looking at these cases synoptically, we get a sense as to how
			<lb />
			much damage the basic structure can withstand before
			<lb />
			crumbling. In Kesavananda, the second part of Article 31C
			<lb />
			precluded courts from reviewing whether a law under Article
			<lb />
			39(b) or (c) promoted the policy for which it was enacted. This
			<lb />
			violated the basic structure. Article 31C was introduced by the
			<lb />
			25th Amendment.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			145.
			<lb />
			In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain &amp; Another (1975)
			<lb />
			Supp SCC 1, the Court struck Article 329A(4) as violative of the
			<lb />
			basic structure. This provision appropriated the Court&apos;s power
			<lb />
			to adjudicate election laws, encroaching on the judiciary in
			<lb />
			violation of separation of powers. See Justice Matthew&apos;s opinion
			<lb />
			at para 325. It was introduced by the 39th Amendment. In
			<lb />
			Minerva Mills, the Court held sections 4 and 55 of the 42nd
			<lb />
			Amendment in violation of the basic structure. Section 4 sought
			<lb />
			to expand 31C such that all laws giving effect to Directive
			<lb />
			Principles, not just those intended to promote Article 39(b) or (c),
			<lb />
			would be immune to an Article 14 or 19 challenge. Section 55
			<lb />
			would have barred judicial review of constitutional amendments.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			146.
			<lb />
			In P. Sambamurthy v. State of A.P. (1987) 1 SCC 362, the
			<lb />
			Court invalidated Article 371-D(5), finding that the Parliament
			<lb />
			had violated the rule of law and consequently the basic
			<lb />
			structure, by removing judicial review from the High Court and
			<lb />
			placing it in the hands of one of the parties \026 the State
			<lb />
			Government. In L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) 3
			<lb />
			SCC 261, the Court held that Articles 323A-2D and 323B-3D
			<lb />
			violated the basic structure in that they removed judicial review
			<lb />
			of the High Courts and Supreme Court under Articles 226/227
			<lb />
			and 32, respectively. These articles were introduced by the 42nd
			<lb />
			Amendment to empower the Parliament or the State Legislatures
			<lb />
			to establish Tribunals for various substantive areas of law: tax,
			<lb />
			labour, criminal, etc.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			147.
			<lb />
			Two broad themes surface from these cases. When judicial
			<lb />
			review is barred, democracy evaporates. And when Fundamental
			<lb />
			Rights are at stake, they must be harmonized with, not made
			<lb />
			subject to, the Directive Principles. Sections 4 and 55 of the 42nd
			<lb />
			Amendment were especially egregious violations of the basic
			<lb />
			structure. Had Section 4 been upheld, citizens&apos; fundamental
			<lb />
			rights would have been at the mercy of one organ of Government.
			<lb />
			&quot;If Governments always could be trusted, there would have been
			<lb />
			no need for Fundamental rights.&quot; Mr Palkhivala in oral
			<lb />
			arguments in Kesavananda, quoting from the learned Mr H.M.
			<lb />
			Seervai, who was opposing counsel in that case. Mr Palkhivala
			<lb />
			was reading from Seervai, H.M., &quot;Fundamental Rights: A Basic
			<lb />
			Issue,&quot; published in three installments in the Times of India, 14,
			<lb />
			15, 16 February 1955. (See: Granville Austin at pages 263-264
			<lb />
			in &quot;Working a Democratic Constitution&quot;)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			148.
			<lb />
			Government cannot be trusted; that is precisely why we
			<lb />
			divide its powers into separate organs. If it could be trusted,
			<lb />
			there would be no need for co-equal branches in which power is
			<lb />
			shared. Separation of powers is an axiom of democracy.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			149.
			<lb />
			Had Section 55 of the 42nd Amendment been upheld, the
			<lb />
			basic structure of the Constitution could have been destroyed by
			<lb />
			a single slash. Future constitutional amendments would not
			<lb />
			have been reviewed. The impugned Amendment looks rather
			<lb />
			mild in comparison to the damage that would have been wrought
			<lb />
			by the 42nd Amendment. The impugned legislation limits one
			<lb />
			fundamental right in one limited circumstance. Yet an
			<lb />
			amendment need not be as invidious as the 42nd Amendment for
			<lb />
			us to invalidate it. If the standard were that high, amendments
			<lb />
			could destroy the basic structure or the essence of the
			<lb />
			Constitution by a thousand slashes.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			150.
			<lb />
			Since Kesavananda&apos;s time, many amendments have been
			<lb />
			passed and many challenges under the basic structure have
			<lb />
			been made. This Court has used caution and has refrained from
			<lb />
			using the doctrine, even when it may have been justified. For
			<lb />
			example, there were grounds for striking the entire 10th Schedule
			<lb />
			as violative of the basic structure in Kihoto Hollohan v
			<lb />
			Zachillhu &amp; Others 1992 Supp (2) SCC 651. Rather than
			<lb />
			resort to the basic structure, this Court made a narrow ruling on
			<lb />
			procedural grounds. (See: S.P. Sathe, Judicial Activism in India:
			<lb />
			Transgressing Borders and Enforcing Limits, 2nd Edn., 2002
			<lb />
			(Oxford University Press) pages 92-93). The Court upheld the
			<lb />
			10th Schedule, only severing a paragraph from the same. I agree
			<lb />
			that an abundance of caution ought to be taken before
			<lb />
			employing the basic structure doctrine. The violation must truly
			<lb />
			abrogate the basic structure. Anything short of this standard
			<lb />
			must be upheld \026 the will of the people, through their elected
			<lb />
			representatives, heard.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			151.
			<lb />
			Before making such a determination, it is prudent to briefly
			<lb />
			revisit the rulings of two landmark cases: P.A. Inamdar &amp;
			<lb />
			Others v. State of Maharashtra &amp; Others, (2005) 6 SCC 537;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			T.M.A. Pai Foundation &amp; Others v. State of Karnataka &amp;
			<lb />
			Others (2002) 8 SCC 481. In Inamdar (supra), paras 26-27
			<lb />
			(seven-Judge Bench), unaided (minority and non-minority)
			<lb />
			professional institutions filed petitions to determine, inter alia,
			<lb />
			whether the State could impose quotas on unaided (minority and
			<lb />
			non-minority) institutions. A seven-Judge Bench was constituted
			<lb />
			such that Islamic Academy&apos;s clarification of Pai could be
			<lb />
			reviewed. Islamic Academy was a five-Judge Bench. Given that
			<lb />
			Pai was an eleven-Judge Bench, Inamdar could clarify but not
			<lb />
			overrule Pai.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			152.
			<lb />
			At para 124, Inamdar held that the State cannot impose
			<lb />
			quotas on unaided (minority and non-minority) institutions. To
			<lb />
			do so would nationalize seats, contrary to Pai. (See: Inamdar at
			<lb />
			para 125). In dictum, Pai suggested that the State could compel
			<lb />
			unaided institutions to admit a reasonable percentage of
			<lb />
			students via reservation. (Pai, para 68). Inamdar clarified this
			<lb />
			point, stating that Pai should be read to mean that the State and
			<lb />
			unaided institutions may enter into consensual agreement
			<lb />
			regarding reservation. (See: Inamdar at para 126). Unaided
			<lb />
			institutions (minority and non-minority) can admit as they
			<lb />
			choose, provided their process is fair, transparent, non-
			<lb />
			exploitative and merit-based. Inamdar stated:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;124: So far as appropriation of quota by the State
			<lb />
			and enforcement of its reservation policy is concerned,
			<lb />
			we do not see much of difference between non-
			<lb />
			minority and minority unaided educational
			<lb />
			institutions. We find great force in the submission
			<lb />
			made on behalf of the petitioners that the States have
			<lb />
			no power to insist on seat sharing in the unaided
			<lb />
			private professional educational institutions by fixing
			<lb />
			a quota of seats between the management and the
			<lb />
			State. The State cannot insist on private
			<lb />
			educational institutions which receive no aid
			<lb />
			from the State to implement State&apos;s policy on
			<lb />
			reservation for granting admission on lesser
			<lb />
			percentage of marks, i.e. on any criterion except
			<lb />
			merit.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			125. As per our understanding, neither in the
			<lb />
			judgment of Pai Foundation nor in the Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench decision in Kerala Education Bill, which was
			<lb />
			approved by Pai Foundation, there is anything which
			<lb />
			would allow the State to regulate or control
			<lb />
			admissions in the unaided professional educational
			<lb />
			institutions so as to compel them to give up a share of
			<lb />
			the available seats to the candidates chosen by the
			<lb />
			State, as if it was filling the seats available to be filled
			<lb />
			up at its discretion in such private institutions. This
			<lb />
			would amount to nationalization of seats which
			<lb />
			has been specifically disapproved in Pai
			<lb />
			Foundation. Such imposition of quota of State
			<lb />
			seats or enforcing reservation policy of the State
			<lb />
			on available seats in unaided professional
			<lb />
			institutions are acts constituting serious
			<lb />
			encroachment on the right and autonomy of
			<lb />
			private professional educational institutions.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			Such appropriation of seats can also not be held
			<lb />
			to be a regulatory measure in the interest of
			<lb />
			minority within the meaning of Article 30(1) or a
			<lb />
			reasonable restriction within the meaning of
			<lb />
			Article 19(6) of the Constitution. Merely because the
			<lb />
			resources of the State in providing professional
			<lb />
			education are limited, private educational institutions,
			<lb />
			which intend to provide better professional education,
			<lb />
			cannot be forced by the State to make admissions
			<lb />
			available on the basis of reservation policy to less
			<lb />
			meritorious candidate. Unaided institutions, as they
			<lb />
			are not deriving any aid from State funds, can
			<lb />
			have their own admissions if fair, transparent,
			<lb />
			non-exploitative and based on merit.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			To the extent that Islamic Academy had approved of quotas in
			<lb />
			unaided institutions, a scheme in which the States could fix
			<lb />
			quota for seat sharing between management and the State,
			<lb />
			Islamic was overruled. [Inamdar at para 130]
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			153.
			<lb />
			In T.M.A. Pai Foundation (supra) para 2 (eleven-Judge
			<lb />
			Bench), private educational institutions, aided and unaided, filed
			<lb />
			writ petitions to challenge regulations that impeded their rights.
			<lb />
			They wanted to establish and administer educational
			<lb />
			institutions, unfettered by Government interference. [para 2].
			<lb />
			Reading Article 29(2) and 30(1) harmoniously, the six-Justice
			<lb />
			majority held that (1) unaided institutions could admit students
			<lb />
			free of Government interference, as long as their admission
			<lb />
			process was transparent and merit-based; (2) minority aided
			<lb />
			institutions may still admit their own students, contingent upon
			<lb />
			admitting a reasonable number of non-minority students per the
			<lb />
			percentage provided by the State Government.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			154.
			<lb />
			For our purposes, it is important to note that education
			<lb />
			falls within the meaning of &quot;occupation&quot; under 19(1)(g). This is
			<lb />
			so because a large number of persons are employed as teachers
			<lb />
			and administrative staff. For them, education is an occupation.
			<lb />
			Pai stated:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;20: &quot;Article 19(1)(g) employs four expressions, viz.,
			<lb />
			profession, occupation, trade and business. Their
			<lb />
			fields may overlap, but each of them does have a
			<lb />
			content of its own. Education is per se regarded as an
			<lb />
			activity that is charitable in nature [See The State of
			<lb />
			Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala, \005 Education has
			<lb />
			so far not been regarded as a trade or business where
			<lb />
			profit is the motive. Even if there is any doubt about
			<lb />
			whether education is a profession or not, it does
			<lb />
			appear that education will fall within the meaning of
			<lb />
			the expression &quot;occupation&quot;. Article 19(1)(g) uses the
			<lb />
			four expressions so as to cover all activities of a citizen
			<lb />
			in respect of which income or profit is generated, and
			<lb />
			which can consequently be regulated under Article
			<lb />
			19(6).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			25 The establishment and running of an educational
			<lb />
			institution where a large number of persons are
			<lb />
			employed as teachers or administrative staff, and an
			<lb />
			activity is carried on that results in the imparting of
			<lb />
			knowledge to the students, must necessarily be
			<lb />
			regarded as an occupation, even if there is no
			<lb />
			element of profit generation. It is difficult to
			<lb />
			comprehended that education, per se, will not fall
			<lb />
			under any of the four expressions in Article 19(1)(g).
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;Occupation&quot; would be an activity of a person
			<lb />
			undertaken as a means of livelihood or a mission in
			<lb />
			life. ...&quot;
			<lb />
			[emphasis added]
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			155. Stripping private unaided institutions of their right to select
			<lb />
			students would be unreasonable:
			<lb />
			&quot;para 40: Any system of student selection would be
			<lb />
			unreasonable if it deprives the private unaided
			<lb />
			institution of the right of rational selection, which it
			<lb />
			devised for itself, subject to the minimum qualification
			<lb />
			that may be prescribed and to some system of
			<lb />
			computing the equivalence between different kinds of
			<lb />
			qualifications, like a common entrance test. Such a
			<lb />
			system of selection can involve both written and oral
			<lb />
			tests for selection, based on principle of fairness.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			156.
			<lb />
			Like Article 15(5) in the instant case, Unni Krishnan
			<lb />
			effectively nationalized education. Pai overturned Unni
			<lb />
			Krishnan. (See: para 45).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;38: The scheme in Unni Krishnan&apos;s case has the
			<lb />
			effect of nationalizing education in respect of
			<lb />
			important features, viz., the right of a private unaided
			<lb />
			institution to give admission and to fix the fee. By
			<lb />
			framing this scheme, which has led to the State
			<lb />
			Governments legislating in conformity with the
			<lb />
			scheme the private institutions are undistinguishable
			<lb />
			from the Government institutions; curtailing all the
			<lb />
			essential features of the right of administration of a
			<lb />
			private unaided educational institution can neither be
			<lb />
			called fair or reasonable.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			157.
			<lb />
			Pai traces the autonomy of institutions back to
			<lb />
			Chitralekha and Rajendran. The proposition is simple: he
			<lb />
			who funds or runs the institution holds the power to select
			<lb />
			students. The State cannot ask these institutions to abridge this
			<lb />
			right in exchange for affiliation/recognition. The relevant
			<lb />
			paragraphs are reproduced hereunder:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;36: The private unaided educational institutions
			<lb />
			impart education, and that cannot be the reason to
			<lb />
			take away their choice in matters, inter alia, of
			<lb />
			selection of students and fixation of fees. Affiliation
			<lb />
			and recognition has to be available to every institution
			<lb />
			that fulfills the conditions for grant of such affiliation
			<lb />
			and recognition. The private institutions are right in
			<lb />
			submitting that it is not open to the Court to insist
			<lb />
			that statutory authorities should impose the terms of
			<lb />
			the scheme as a condition for grant of affiliation or
			<lb />
			recognition; this completely destroys the institutional
			<lb />
			autonomy and the very objective of establishment of
			<lb />
			the institution.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			42. In R. Chitralekha and Anr. v. State of Mysore and
			<lb />
			Ors.[citation omitted], while considering the validity of
			<lb />
			a viva-voce test for admission to a Government
			<lb />
			medical college, it was observed at page 380 that
			<lb />
			colleges run by the Government, having regard to
			<lb />
			financial commitments and other relevant
			<lb />
			considerations, would only admit a specific number of
			<lb />
			students. It had devised a method for screening the
			<lb />
			applicants for admission. While upholding the order so
			<lb />
			issued, it was observed that &quot;once it is conceded, and it
			<lb />
			is not disputed before us, that the State Government
			<lb />
			can run medical and engineering colleges, it cannot be
			<lb />
			denied the power to admit such qualified students as
			<lb />
			pass the reasonable tests laid down by it. This is a
			<lb />
			power which every private owner of a College will have,
			<lb />
			and the Government which runs its own Colleges
			<lb />
			cannot be denied that power.&quot; (italics added by Pai;
			<lb />
			underscore is mine).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			43. Again, in Minor P. Rajendran v. State of Madras
			<lb />
			and Ors \005 , it was observed at page 795 that &quot;so far
			<lb />
			as admission is concerned, it has to be made by those
			<lb />
			who are in control of the Colleges, and in this case the
			<lb />
			Government, because the medical colleges are
			<lb />
			Government colleges affiliated to the University. In
			<lb />
			these circumstances, the Government was entitled to
			<lb />
			frame rules for admission to medical colleges controlled
			<lb />
			by it subject to the rules of the university as to eligibility
			<lb />
			and qualifications.&quot; The aforesaid observations clearly
			<lb />
			underscore the right of the colleges to frame rules for
			<lb />
			admission and to admit students. The only
			<lb />
			requirement or control is that the rules for admission
			<lb />
			must be subject to the rules of the university as to
			<lb />
			eligibility and qualifications. The Court did not say that
			<lb />
			the university could provide the manner in which the
			<lb />
			students were to be selected.

			to administration, including the right of appointment,
			<lb />
			disciplinary powers, admission of students and the
			<lb />
			fees to be charged.&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>

			<lb />
			Unaided institutions may admit students of their choice,
			<lb />
			subject to an objective and rational procedure of selection. They
			<lb />
			might admit a small percentage of students belonging to the
			<lb />
			weaker sections of the society by granting those sections
			<lb />
			freeships or scholarships, if not granted by the Government.
			<lb />
			[See: Pai at para 53]. Given a transparent and reasonable
			<lb />
			selection process, it is up to the institution to define &quot;merit&quot;
			<lb />
			according to its own values. Pai stated:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;65. The reputation of an educational institution is
			<lb />
			established by the quality of its faculty and students,
			<lb />
			and the educational and other facilities that the
			<lb />
			colleges has to offer. The private educational
			<lb />
			institutions have a personality of their own, and in
			<lb />
			order to maintain their atmosphere and traditions, it
			<lb />
			is but necessary that they must have the right to
			<lb />
			choose and select the students who can be admitted to
			<lb />
			their courses of studies. If is for this reason that in the
			<lb />
			St. Stephen&apos;s College case, this Court upheld the
			<lb />
			scheme whereby a cut-off percentage was fixed for
			<lb />
			admission, after which the students were interviewed
			<lb />
			and thereafter selected. While an educational
			<lb />
			institution cannot grant admission on its whims and
			<lb />
			fancies, and must follow some identifiable or
			<lb />
			reasonable methodology of admitting the students,
			<lb />
			any scheme, rule or regulation that does not give the
			<lb />
			institution the right to reject candidates who might
			<lb />
			otherwise be qualified according to say their
			<lb />
			performance in an entrance test, would be an
			<lb />
			unreasonable restriction under Article 19(6), though
			<lb />
			appropriate guidelines/modalities can be prescribed
			<lb />
			for holding the entrance test a fair manner. Even when
			<lb />
			students are required to be selected on the basis of
			<lb />
			merit, the ultimate decision to grant admission to the
			<lb />
			students who have otherwise qualified for the grant of
			<lb />
			admission must be left with the educational
			<lb />
			institution concerned. However, when the institution
			<lb />
			rejects such students, such rejection must not be
			<lb />
			whimsical or for extraneous reasons.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			159.
			<lb />
			The Court distinguishes between reasonable and
			<lb />
			unreasonable regulations by asking which functions lie at the
			<lb />
			heart of an institution&apos;s autonomy. Regulations that strike at the
			<lb />
			core of autonomy are unreasonable. For example, prescribing
			<lb />
			minimum qualifications for teachers is a reasonable regulation;
			<lb />
			actually selecting the teachers is not.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;55. But the essence of a private educational
			<lb />
			institution is the autonomy that the institution must
			<lb />
			have in its management and administration. There,
			<lb />
			necessarily, has to be a difference in the
			<lb />
			administration of private unaided institutions and
			<lb />
			the Government-aided institutions. Whereas in the
			<lb />
			latter case, the Government will have greater say in
			<lb />
			the administration, including admissions and fixing
			<lb />
			of fees, in the case of private unaided institutions,
			<lb />
			maximum autonomy in the day-to-day
			<lb />
			administration has to be with the private unaided
			<lb />
			institutions. Bureaucratic or Governmental
			<lb />
			interference in the administration of such an
			<lb />
			institution will undermine its independence. While
			<lb />
			an educational institution is not a business, in order
			<lb />
			to examine the degree of independence that can be
			<lb />
			given to a recognized educational institution, like any
			<lb />
			private entity that does not seek aid or assistance
			<lb />
			from the Government, and that exists by virtue of the
			<lb />
			funds generated by it, including its loans or
			<lb />
			borrowings, it is important to note that the essential
			<lb />
			ingredients of the management of the private
			<lb />
			institution include the recruiting students and staff,
			<lb />
			and the quantum of fee that is to be charged.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			160.
			<lb />
			The same argument was framed in similar terms in St.
			<lb />
			Stephen&apos;s College v. University of Delhi, 1992 (1) SCC 558.
			<lb />
			In that case, the Court distinguished regulations based on
			<lb />
			whether they directly or indirectly affected management. Those
			<lb />
			that indirectly affected management were reasonable; those that
			<lb />
			directly affected the management of the institution were not.
			<lb />
			[Pai at para 125].
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			161.
			<lb />
			In St. Stephen&apos;s, this Court referred to the earlier
			<lb />
			decisions, and with regard to Article 30(1) observed at page 596,
			<lb />
			paragraph 54, as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005 But the standards of education are not a part of
			<lb />
			the management as such. The standard concerns the
			<lb />
			body politic and is governed by considerations of the
			<lb />
			advancement of the country and its people. Such
			<lb />
			regulations do not bear directly upon management
			<lb />
			although they may indirectly affect it. The State,
			<lb />
			therefore has the right to regulate the standard of
			<lb />
			education and allied matters.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			162.
			<lb />
			Once a private institution (non-minority) takes aid, it is
			<lb />
			subject to (1) reservation and (2) regulation of administration and
			<lb />
			maintenance of the institution. Pai stated:
			<lb />
			&quot;71: &quot;While giving aid to professional institutions, it
			<lb />
			would be permissible for the authority giving aid to
			<lb />
			prescribe by rules or regulations, the conditions on
			<lb />
			the basis of which admission will be granted to
			<lb />
			different aided colleges by virtue of merit, coupled with
			<lb />
			the reservation policy of the state. \005
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			72: &quot;Once aid is granted to a private professional
			<lb />
			educational institution, the Government or the state
			<lb />
			agency, as a condition of the grant of aid, can put
			<lb />
			fetters on the freedom in the matter of administration
			<lb />
			and management of the institution. The state, which
			<lb />
			gives aid to an educational institution, can impose
			<lb />
			such conditions as are necessary for the proper
			<lb />
			maintenance of the high standards of education as the
			<lb />
			financial burden is shared by the state. \005&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			163.
			<lb />
			I now query if the Parliament may subject Article 19(1)(g) to
			<lb />
			Article 15(5), when this Court has held that reservation in
			<lb />
			unaided institutions is an unreasonable restriction that cannot
			<lb />
			be saved by Article 19(6).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			164.
			<lb />
			I answer this question in the affirmative. The structure of
			<lb />
			our Constitution permits fundamental rights, and even the
			<lb />
			Golden Triangle of Articles 14, 19 and 21, to be abridged in
			<lb />
			limited circumstances. To say that subjecting Articles 19(1)(g) to
			<lb />
			15(5) violates the basic structure per se is to ignore the examples
			<lb />
			in which the most fundamental of rights is limited. Article 16(4)
			<lb />
			expressly limits the right to formal equality in 16(1), a specific
			<lb />
			facet of Article 14. In this light, Article 16(4) impliedly limits the
			<lb />
			general right to formal equality in Article 14. The right to equality
			<lb />
			is expressed in the negative in 15(1): the State shall not
			<lb />
			discriminate based on religion, race, caste, etc. In other words,
			<lb />
			the State shall treat citizens of different religions, races and
			<lb />
			castes equally. Like Article 16(4), Article 15(4) limits 15(1) --
			<lb />
			another facet of Article 14 formal equality --such that egalitarian
			<lb />
			equality may be pursued. Generally speaking, Articles 15(3) and
			<lb />
			(4) and 16(4) allow the State to impose affirmative action
			<lb />
			programs on the public sector. Such provisions necessarily limit
			<lb />
			the right to formal equality.
			<lb />
			If the right to equality, considered
			<lb />
			by some as a basic postulate of the Constitution, has been
			<lb />
			limited, a fortiori Article 19(1)(g) can be too.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			165.
			<lb />
			Along these lines, I could turn to Articles 31A, 31B and 31C
			<lb />
			for further support. Those Articles exclude challenges under
			<lb />
			Articles 14 and 19. In agreement with Dr. Dhavan&apos;s submission,
			<lb />
			I decline to rely on Articles 31A, 31B and 31C for support. As
			<lb />
			explained in Minerva Mills, the Court had previously upheld
			<lb />
			Article 31A out of concern for stare decisis. The Court never
			<lb />
			approved of the exclusion of Articles 14 and 19 on a principled
			<lb />
			basis. Nor did it make a ruling as to whether the exclusion
			<lb />
			violated the basic structure. (See: para 71-72 of Minerva Mills.
			<lb />
			See also para 43 of Waman Rao, (1981) 2 SCC 362).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			166.
			<lb />
			A basic structure challenge becomes an issue of
			<lb />
			institutional competence. Is it for the legislature to decide what
			<lb />
			is a reasonable restriction under 19(1)(g) read with 19(6)? Or is
			<lb />
			it for the judiciary? It is well established that the Parliament,
			<lb />
			expressing the will of the people, may enact amendments to
			<lb />
			overrule a judgment of this Court. The First Parliament added
			<lb />
			Article 15(4) to the Constitution to overrule State of Madras v.
			<lb />
			Champakam Dorairajan, AIR 1951 SC 226. Other examples
			<lb />
			include the 77th Amendment, which overruled Sawhney I by
			<lb />
			adding Article 16(4-A); the 81st Amendment further overruled
			<lb />
			Sawhney I by adding Art 16 (4-B); the 82nd Amendment
			<lb />
			overruled S. Vinod Kumar &amp; Another v. Union of India &amp;
			<lb />
			Another (1996) 6 SCC 580 by amending Article 335; and the
			<lb />
			85th Amendment overruled Virpal Singh Chauhann and Ajit
			<lb />
			Singh I by amending Article 16(4-A), (1995) 6 SCC 684 and
			<lb />
			(1996) 2 SCC 715, respectively. Nevertheless, the duty to
			<lb />
			interpret the content of our fundamental rights has been left to
			<lb />
			the Courts. &quot;The important point to be noted is that the content
			<lb />
			of a right is defined by the Courts. The final word on the content
			<lb />
			of the right is of this Court.&quot; (Nagaraj at para 21). (emphasis
			<lb />
			added). While the Parliament may amend the Constitution, it
			<lb />
			cannot alter the Constitution&apos;s basic structure. (See:
			<lb />
			Kesavananda, Indira Nehru Gandhi (Election Case), Minerva
			<lb />
			Mills, Sambamurthy, L. Chandra Kumar and Coelho).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			7
			<lb />
			Step Two: Does Article 15(5) affect Article
			<lb />
			19(1)(g) to such an extent that Article 19(1)(g)&apos;s
			<lb />
			original identity has been altered?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			167.
			<lb />
			In other words, does Art 15(5) in effect merely abridge or
			<lb />
			completely abrogate Article 19(1)(g). If the former, 15(5) stands.
			<lb />
			If the latter, it falls. As noted above, Coelho directs me to apply
			<lb />
			the impact/rights test to determine whether the basic structure
			<lb />
			has been violated. [See Coehlo at Conclusion (ii) at page 111].
			<lb />
			Thus, my query is whether to consider the impact on the entire
			<lb />
			constitutional framework, or to examine the effect on citizens
			<lb />
			engaged in unaided education as an occupation. I think it is the
			<lb />
			latter. I am not concerned here with those engaged in education
			<lb />
			in aided institutions. One is naturally subject to greater
			<lb />
			regulation when one relies on Government funding. (See:
			<lb />
			Pai/Inamdar). Individual liberty and freedom, as protected by
			<lb />
			the Golden Triangle, must carry greater weight for those who set
			<lb />
			off on their own and refuse Government money.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			168. This brings me to the question as to how large I should
			<lb />
			draw the circle when I ask who is affected by reservation in
			<lb />
			unaided institutions. Justice Chandrachud provides that &quot;[a]
			<lb />
			total deprivation of fundamental rights, even in a limited area,
			<lb />
			can amount to abrogation of fundamental right just as a partial
			<lb />
			deprivation in every area can.&quot; (See: Minerva Mills, para 59).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			169.
			<lb />
			Freedom under Article 19 belongs to individual citizens.
			<lb />
			Article 19(1)(g) provides that &quot;all citizens shall have the right to
			<lb />
			practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or
			<lb />
			business.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			The reference to &quot;all citizens&quot; means that each and
			<lb />
			every individual citizen possesses Article 19 rights. For the
			<lb />
			impugned legislation to fall, it need not touch every sphere of
			<lb />
			society. If even one individual&apos;s freedom has been curtailed, this
			<lb />
			Court is duty bound to entertain his or her claim. It is he or she
			<lb />
			who possesses the Article 19(1)(g) right to carry on an
			<lb />
			occupation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			170.
			<lb />
			If 15(5) were implemented, the educator in unaided
			<lb />
			institutions would still have students to educate. I use
			<lb />
			&quot;educator&quot; in the broadest sense of the term and include
			<lb />
			teachers, professors, lecturers, faculty, staff, administrators and
			<lb />
			those who finance institutions. Without one of the
			<lb />
			aforementioned, the institution cannot function properly.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			171.
			<lb />
			Though affected by reservation, the educator still has a job.
			<lb />
			His occupation remains intact.
			<lb />
			Students will come. Classes will
			<lb />
			commence. Marks will be distributed. The greatest impact on
			<lb />
			the educator is that neither he nor his institution will choose
			<lb />
			whom to teach.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			172.
			<lb />
			Almost half of the time (49.5%), the State would decide for
			<lb />
			them. Selecting students or employees goes to the heart of an
			<lb />
			organization&apos;s autonomy. The essence of an unaided educational
			<lb />
			institution is the freedom to manage its affairs, according to Pai
			<lb />
			at paragraph 55. That is, &quot;\005 the essential ingredients of the
			<lb />
			management of the private institution include the recruiting [of]
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			students and staff \005 .&quot;
			<lb />
			The same argument was framed in
			<lb />
			similar terms (at para 54) in St. Stephen&apos;s College (regulations
			<lb />
			imposing standards of education upheld, because they &quot;\005 do not
			<lb />
			bear directly upon management although they may indirectly
			<lb />
			affect it \005&quot;). This Court has stated in Pai as clarified by
			<lb />
			Inamdar that subjecting unaided institutions is an
			<lb />
			unreasonable restriction. As noted, Article 19(6) provides no safe
			<lb />
			haven for reservations.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			173.
			<lb />
			The Government-imposed selection of students in turn
			<lb />
			has wide-ranging consequences for unaided institutions and
			<lb />
			their educators. I am required to examine the effect of the
			<lb />
			impugned Amendment. At least four problems will likely arise:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(1)
			<lb />
			academic standards suffer;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2)
			<lb />
			attracting and retaining good faculty becomes
			<lb />
			more difficult;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3)
			<lb />
			the incentive to establish a first rate unaided
			<lb />
			institution is diminished;
		</item>
		<lb />


		<item>
			(4)
			<lb />
			and ultimately the global reputation of our
			<lb />
			unaided institutions is severely compromised.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			174.
			<lb />
			First, once the State tells them whom to teach, standards of
			<lb />
			excellence will suffer. This is because those institutions will no
			<lb />
			longer be able to admit the highest-scoring students. As good as
			<lb />
			some of our institutions are, they do not teach blank slates. The
			<lb />
			best universities are the best, in part, because they attract the
			<lb />
			best students. The same can be said for almost any
			<lb />
			organization. In the case of higher education, the universities
			<lb />
			that admit the best will likely churn out the best. The precise
			<lb />
			extent to which the university made the best so good cannot be
			<lb />
			qualified. The point is that universities alone cannot produce
			<lb />
			qualified job candidates. Forced to admit students with lower
			<lb />
			marks, the university&apos;s final product will not be as strong. Once
			<lb />
			the creamy is excluded, cut-off marks would likely drop
			<lb />
			considerably in order to fill the 27% quota for non creamy layer
			<lb />
			OBCs. When the creamy layer is not removed, as in the case of
			<lb />
			Tamil Nadu, the difference in cut off marks for the general and
			<lb />
			backward categories may be insignificant. (See para 408 of
			<lb />
			Sawhney I). Of course, the extent to which standards of
			<lb />
			excellence would suffer would vary by institution. As I mention
			<lb />
			below, I urge the Government to set OBC cut off marks no lower
			<lb />
			than 10 marks below that of the general category. This is only a
			<lb />
			recommendation, however. It may never be adopted.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			175.
			<lb />
			Second, reservations weaken the incentive to establish
			<lb />
			unaided institutions: if the State usurps the right to select
			<lb />
			students, would one still spend the time and money to establish
			<lb />
			an unaided institution? The question is all the more relevant
			<lb />
			today. Counsel for petitioners posit that tomorrow&apos;s knowledge
			<lb />
			economy requires a well-educated populace. &quot;Well-educated&quot;
			<lb />
			does not imply a string of degrees from less than taxing
			<lb />
			institutions. Rather, it means that one will possess the skills,
			<lb />
			knowledge and creativity to compete globally. Our unaided
			<lb />
			institutions must remain places where these traits are refined.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			176.
			<lb />
			Third, those inclined to teach the brightest students have
			<lb />
			even less of a reason to leave private sector jobs for the teaching
			<lb />
			profession or to join the profession in the first place. &quot;Brightest&quot;
			<lb />
			would come with an asterisk. They would be the brightest
			<lb />
			available under the Government&apos;s reservation scheme. These
			<lb />
			potential teachers may ask themselves: how will I teach a class
			<lb />
			in which half the students are advanced relative to the other
			<lb />
			half? In many institutions, the shortage of top-rate faculty will
			<lb />
			only get worse. Fourth, reservations may have a negative impact
			<lb />
			on students seeking employment in the burgeoning knowledge
			<lb />
			economy. Recruiters have begun to trickle into campuses. They
			<lb />
			hail from domestic as well as international entities, and they too
			<lb />
			may take note of reservations in unaided institutions. The effect
			<lb />
			on educators, from the top down, would be felt. For them, little
			<lb />
			more than a semblance of occupation would remain.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			177.
			<lb />
			Given the dramatic effect that reservations would have on
			<lb />
			educators, the unaided institutions in which they teach and,
			<lb />
			consequently, society as a whole, Article 19(1)(g) has been more
			<lb />
			than abridged. When education is effectively nationalized,
			<lb />
			freedom stands obliterated. The identity of the Constitution is
			<lb />
			altered when unreasonable restrictions make a fundamental
			<lb />
			right meaningless. The 93rd Amendment&apos;s imposition of
			<lb />
			reservation on unaided institutions has abrogated Article
			<lb />
			19(1)(g), a basic feature of the Constitution, in violation of our
			<lb />
			Constitution&apos;s basic structure. Therefore, I
			<lb />
			sever the 93rd Amendment&apos;s reference to &quot;unaided&quot; institutions
			<lb />
			as ultra vires of the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			178.
			<lb />
			The case law on severability asks the following question:
			<lb />
			had the Parliament known its provision would be severed would
			<lb />
			it still have passed the rest of the legislation? (See: R.M.D.
			<lb />
			Chamarbaugwalla (supra)).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			179.
			<lb />
			At page 943 of R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla (supra), the
			<lb />
			Court relied in part on The State of Bombay &amp; Another v. F.N.
			<lb />
			Balsara (1951) SCR 682, where the question at issue was
			<lb />
			whether the Bombay Prohibition Act was valid:
			<lb />
			Sections 12 and 13 of the Act imposed restrictions on
			<lb />
			the possession, consumption and sale of liquor, which
			<lb />
			had been defined in s. 2(24) of the Act as including &quot;(a)
			<lb />
			spirits of wine, methylated spirits, wine, beer, toddy
			<lb />
			and all liquids consisting of or containing alcohol, and
			<lb />
			(b) any other intoxicating substance which the
			<lb />
			Provincial Government may, by notification in the
			<lb />
			Official Gazette, declare to be liquor for the purposes
			<lb />
			of this Act&quot;. Certain medicinal and toilet preparations
			<lb />
			had been declared liquor by notification issued by the
			<lb />
			Government under s. 2(24)(b). The Act was attacked
			<lb />
			in its entirety as violative of the rights protected by
			<lb />
			Art. 19(1)(f). But this Court held that the impugned
			<lb />
			provisions were unreasonable and therefore void in so
			<lb />
			far as medicinal and toilet preparations were
			<lb />
			concerned, but valid as to the rest. Then, the
			<lb />
			contention was raised that &quot;as the law purports to
			<lb />
			authorise the imposition of a restriction on a
			<lb />
			fundamental right in language wide enough to cover
			<lb />
			restrictions both within and without the limits of
			<lb />
			constitutionally permissible legislative action affecting
			<lb />
			such right, it is not possible to uphold it even so far as
			<lb />
			it may be applied within the constitutional limits, as it
			<lb />
			is not severable&quot;. In rejecting this contention, the
			<lb />
			Court observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&apos;These items being thus treated
			<lb />
			separately by the legislature itself and being
			<lb />
			severable, and it is not being contended, in
			<lb />
			view of the directive principles of State
			<lb />
			policy regarding prohibition, that the
			<lb />
			restrictions imposed upon the right to
			<lb />
			possess or sell or buy or consume or use
			<lb />
			those categories of properties are
			<lb />
			unreasonable, the impugned sections must
			<lb />
			be held valid so far as these categories are
			<lb />
			concerned.&apos;
			<lb />
			This decision is clear authority that the
			<lb />
			principle of severability is applicable even
			<lb />
			when Act&apos;s invalidity arises by reason of its
			<lb />
			contravention of constitutional limitations.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			180.
			<lb />
			At page 944, the court in R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla
			<lb />
			sought guidance from American case law on severability:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;In discussing the effect of a severability clause,
			<lb />
			Brandies, J. observed in Dorchy v. State of Kansas
			<lb />
			(1924) 264 US 286 that it &quot;provides a rule of
			<lb />
			construction, which may sometimes aid in
			<lb />
			determining that intent. But it is an aid merely; not
			<lb />
			an inexorable command&quot;. The weight to be attached
			<lb />
			to a classification of subjects made in the statute itself
			<lb />
			cannot, in our opinion, be greater than that of a
			<lb />
			severability clause.&quot;

			<lb />
			Patanjali Sastri, C.J., in The State of Bombay &amp; Another v.
			<lb />
			The United Motors (India) Ltd. &amp; Others (1953) SCR 1069:

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&apos;It is a sound rule to extend severability to
			<lb />
			include separability in enforcement in such cases, and

			we are of opinion that the principle should be applied

		<p>
			182. Here, I believe the Parliament would have gone forward
			<lb />
			without unaided institutions. While some Members of
			<lb />
			Parliament sought to overrule Pai and Inamdar, the
			<lb />
			Parliament&apos;s actions speak louder than its words. Once it had
			<lb />
			passed Article 15(5), it limited itself to imposing greater
			<lb />
			reservations on aided institutions. Had unaided institutions been
			<lb />
			the Parliament&apos;s priority, it could have included them in the
			<lb />
			Reservation Act. It seems that the Parliament&apos;s intent is to pass
			<lb />
			as much reservation as possible. That would explain why it has
			<lb />
			gone forward with 27% reservation for OBCs without confirming
			<lb />
			that at least 27% of the population is OBC. For these reasons, I
			<lb />
			conclude that had the Parliament known that unaided
			<lb />
			institutions were going to be severed, it would have nevertheless
			<lb />
			carried out its reservation scheme for aided institutions.

			The Casteless and Classless Society versus

			Caste-based Reservation:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			183.
			<lb />
			The caste system is peculiar to this country.
			<lb />
			Perhaps
			<lb />
			the entire society has been divided on the basis of caste. This
			<lb />
			social problem can be compared to some extent with that of
			<lb />
			American society. In the U.S., the problem of racial
			<lb />
			discrimination has existed for centuries. The cases of
			<lb />
			affirmative action decided in the United States are relevant.
			<lb />
			They show us how that society has dealt with the problem of
			<lb />
			racial discrimination. At the outset, I would like to make it
			<lb />
			clear that decisions of foreign countries are not binding on
			<lb />
			Indian courts. Indian Courts have not adopted American
			<lb />
			standards of review. But the judgments delivered by U.S.
			<lb />
			courts on affirmative action have great persuasive value and
			<lb />
			they may provide broad guidelines as to how we should tackle
			<lb />
			our prevailing condition. A large number of English laws have
			<lb />
			been inherited by India and America. English and American
			<lb />
			cases are frequently cited by our courts. We need to keep our
			<lb />
			window open and permit the light of knowledge to enter from
			<lb />
			any source. In this light, I shall refer to some US decisions.

			<lb />
			In 1978, Regents of the University of California v.
			<lb />
			Bakke put an end to reservation (&quot;quotas&quot;) in education
			<lb />
			(reserving 16 out of 100 seats for minorities in medical school
			<lb />
			deemed unconstitutional). (438 U.S. 265). Justice Powell&apos;s
			<lb />
			concurring judgment is considered the key opinion in the case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			185.
			<lb />
			Justice Powell concluded that diversity was a compelling
			<lb />
			State interest that could withstand strict scrutiny. Relying on
			<lb />
			Bakke, the court later reaffirmed preferential treatment in
			<lb />
			college admissions as a means to ensure diversity in the
			<lb />
			classroom \026 racial diversity being just one among many types of
			<lb />
			diversity (&quot;overcoming personal adversity and family hardship&quot;
			<lb />
			was another form of diversity), (See: Grutter v. Bollinger, 539
			<lb />
			U. S. 306, 338 (2003)). The Grutter Case insisted that
			<lb />
			universities make an individualized evaluation of a student
			<lb />
			seeking admission, rather than one that mechanically accepted
			<lb />
			or rejected students on the basis of race. (Grutter at 337). Such
			<lb />
			an evaluation would ensure that race was only considered as one
			<lb />
			type of diversity, rather than a pretext for achieving racial
			<lb />
			balance. Quotas could not be covertly installed in the name of
			<lb />
			diversity. This reasoning led the court to strike down an
			<lb />
			admission scheme that automatically assigned more points to
			<lb />
			minority students than to residents of the State or to athletes, for
			<lb />
			example. (Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 270).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			186.
			<lb />
			Justice O&apos;Conner for the majority in Grutter came to a very
			<lb />
			significant conclusion. She suggested that there was time limit
			<lb />
			on preferential treatment for certain races as a means of
			<lb />
			promoting diversity. Justice O&apos;Connor stated: &quot;we expect that 25
			<lb />
			years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be
			<lb />
			necessary to further the interest approved today.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			187.
			<lb />
			In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle
			<lb />
			School District No.1 et al, reported in 168 Lawyers Ed. 2d 508
			<lb />
			&amp; 517 (2007), school districts used a student&apos;s race to assign
			<lb />
			that student to a particular school within the district. In Seattle,
			<lb />
			this was done to achieve racial balance amongst the district&apos;s
			<lb />
			schools.
			<lb />
			One school should not be overwhelmingly white,
			<lb />
			another all non-white. Unlike the system approved in Grutter,
			<lb />
			race was not just one among many types of diversity that was
			<lb />
			considered by the district in assigning students. Seattle at 525.
			<lb />
			Instead, it was, at times, the decisive factor. The court held the
			<lb />
			programmes unconstitutional. Chief Justice Roberts summed up
			<lb />
			the plurality&apos;s view on racial classifications: &quot;the way to stop
			<lb />
			discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on
			<lb />
			the basis of race.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			188.
			<lb />
			This was far from a complete victory for the plurality. In his
			<lb />
			concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy found the programmes
			<lb />
			unconstitutional. However, he would not go so far as to treat all
			<lb />
			racial balancing as per se unconstitutional. He considered the
			<lb />
			plurality opinion to represent &quot;\005 an all-too-unyielding insistence
			<lb />
			that race cannot be a factor in instances, when, in [his] view, it
			<lb />
			may be taken into account.&quot; (Seattle at 565).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			189.
			<lb />
			Justice Kennedy found that schools have a compelling
			<lb />
			interest to prevent racial isolation or achieve a diverse student
			<lb />
			population. (Seattle at 572).
			<lb />
			Like Justice Powell&apos;s concurring
			<lb />
			opinion in Bakke, Justice Kennedy&apos;s concurring opinion leaves
			<lb />
			the door open for further use of racial classification for so-called
			<lb />
			benign purposes in school admissions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			190.
			<lb />
			More important than any one case are the standards by
			<lb />
			which the court scrutinized discriminatory legislation. Of course,
			<lb />
			Indian courts have not accepted the principles of narrow
			<lb />
			tailoring and strict scrutiny. Nevertheless, we should seek
			<lb />
			guidance from any corner and permit the light from any quarter.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			191.
			<lb />
			Whenever legislation is challenged as unconstitutional,
			<lb />
			courts must ask themselves how much deference they will give to
			<lb />
			the legislature. The answer is that it depends on the nature of
			<lb />
			the impugned legislation. The United States Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			evolved three standards of review for Government action that
			<lb />
			treats different people differently. The first is the rational basis
			<lb />
			standard. When the classification is rationally related to any
			<lb />
			legitimate Government purpose, the court defers to the State and
			<lb />
			upholds the classification. This is the most deferential of the
			<lb />
			three standards. The second standard is intermediate scrutiny,
			<lb />
			which is less deferential to Government. Here, the court asks
			<lb />
			whether the classification is substantially related to any
			<lb />
			important Government purpose. The third and highest level of
			<lb />
			review is known as strict scrutiny, whereby the court requires
			<lb />
			that the classification are narrowly tailored to a compelling state
			<lb />
			interest. Strict scrutiny test is the least deferential to
			<lb />
			Government.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			192.
			<lb />
			Of the classifications on which there is case law, the one
			<lb />
			that most closely resembles caste is race. This is because both
			<lb />
			are immutable traits. They are used by the powerful, or those
			<lb />
			seeking power, to justify oppression. Racism and casteism have
			<lb />
			long haunted both Nations. In the United States, race raises red
			<lb />
			flags. It is often, though not always, reviewed under strict
			<lb />
			scrutiny: &quot;Government action dividing people by race is
			<lb />
			inherently suspect because such classifications promote &apos;notions
			<lb />
			of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility,&apos;
			<lb />
			(Croson at 102 L. Ed. 2d 854) and &quot;racial classifications are
			<lb />
			simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact
			<lb />
			connection between the justification and the classification.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 270 (quoting J. Stevens&apos;
			<lb />
			dissent in Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 537)).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			193.
			<lb />
			Legislation whose text does not classify based on race is
			<lb />
			considered facially neutral. When facially neutral legislation has
			<lb />
			a disproportionate impact on a particular race, American courts
			<lb />
			ask whether it was passed with an intention to discriminate. If
			<lb />
			no intention is found, the rational basis test applies. [See:
			<lb />
			Hernandez v New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (quoting from
			<lb />
			Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development
			<lb />
			Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-265 (1977)]:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;A court addressing this issue must keep in mind the
			<lb />
			fundamental principle that &quot;official action will not be
			<lb />
			held unconstitutional solely because it results in a
			<lb />
			racially disproportionate impact. . . . Proof of racially
			<lb />
			discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a
			<lb />
			violation of the Equal Protection Clause.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			<lb />
			See also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976). The
			<lb />
			exception to this rule is Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356
			<lb />
			(1886), where extreme disproportionate impact warranted greater
			<lb />
			scrutiny. Where there is disproportionate impact and
			<lb />
			discriminatory intention, then even facially neutral legislation
			<lb />
			triggers strict scrutiny. However, in this framework, affirmative
			<lb />
			action classifies on the face of legislation and automatically gets
			<lb />
			strict scrutiny treatment.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			194.
			<lb />
			As I have observed, American courts carefully review racial
			<lb />
			classifications.
			<lb />
			Given that the 93rd Amendment on its face
			<lb />
			discriminates against general category students, we should give
			<lb />
			it careful scrutiny. The Article 14 right to formal equality
			<lb />
			deserves as much. If 49.5% caste-based reservation was upheld
			<lb />
			in Sawhney I for Government employment, it follows that 49.5%
			<lb />
			caste-based reservation is permitted in aided educational
			<lb />
			institutions. While I compelled by Sawhney I to hold that the
			<lb />
			impugned legislation passes careful scrutiny with respect to
			<lb />
			reservation in aided institutions, its implementation is
			<lb />
			contingent upon the directions given in this opinion.

			The Framers&apos; ultimate goal: the Classless and
			<lb />
			Casteless society:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			195.
			<lb />
			Did the original Framers intend to provide caste-based
			<lb />
			reservation in education to the lower classes? No, the original
			<lb />
			Framers did not. Soon after the Constitution was adopted, the
			<lb />
			very same Framers acted quickly to permit reservation for
			<lb />
			SC/ST/SEBCs in education by adding Art 15(4), vide the First
			<lb />
			Amendment, to the Constitution. In doing so, they deviated from
			<lb />
			their own goal \026 the casteless society would have to wait. In
			<lb />
			Sawhney I, the Court upheld this decision and bound us to a
			<lb />
			certain degree on this point. I have no choice but to uphold the
			<lb />
			impugned legislation by which the Government may still identify
			<lb />
			SEBCs, in part, by using caste.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			196.
			<lb />
			Caste-based reservation was initially a temporary measure
			<lb />
			that was to only last for ten years. The original Framers
			<lb />
			considered caste-based reservation a necessary evil. Thus, they
			<lb />
			limited it in time. Extending this time limit has only exacerbated
			<lb />
			casteism.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			197.
			<lb />
			The Parliamentary Debates clearly reflect that the ultimate
			<lb />
			aim of reservation was a casteless and classless society for India.
			<lb />
			To this end, reservation should only be given for a specific period
			<lb />
			of time. If these reservations or benefits have to continue
			<lb />
			perpetually, then the basic goal of achieving casteless and
			<lb />
			classless society would never be accomplished.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			198.
			<lb />
			The need for caste-based reservation has &quot;worn out&quot; over
			<lb />
			time. Evidence for the proposition that caste is no longer a valid
			<lb />
			determinant of one&apos;s ability to move up in society is strong. More
			<lb />
			than the way society judges you based on caste, the relevant
			<lb />
			question is whether caste precludes you from rising. If caste
			<lb />
			doesn&apos;t, then what does? The answer is simple: money.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			199.
			<lb />
			Income is a much better determinant of educational
			<lb />
			achievement than caste. The table below was derived from the
			<lb />
			Reproductive Child and Health Survey, 2002-2004 (600,000
			<lb />
			households surveyed).

			<lb />
			As drafters, the original Framers were prolific. They made
			<lb />
			our Constitution the world&apos;s longest \026 removing as many doubts
			<lb />
			as possible and in that way limiting the Court&apos;s role. The
			<lb />
			Constitution contains a number of Articles that reserve seats for
			<lb />
			various groups. The original Framers, however, imposed various
			<lb />
			limitations on reservation. These limitations provide insight into
			<lb />
			the original Framers&apos; compromise between formal and
			<lb />
			substantial/egalitarian equality.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			201.
			<lb />
			Reservation is only provided for certain groups (SC, ST and
			<lb />
			backward classes) in certain areas of the public sector. (See:
			<lb />
			Article 16(4) (reservation of posts in Government service for
			<lb />
			backward classes), Article 330 (reservation of seats for SC and ST
			<lb />
			in the Lok Sabha) and Article 332 (reservation of seats for SC and
			<lb />
			ST in Legislative Assemblies of the States)).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			202.
			<lb />
			Dr Ambedkar stated that &quot;the report of the Minorities
			<lb />
			Committee provided that all minorities should have two benefits
			<lb />
			or privileges, namely representation in the legislatures and
			<lb />
			representation in the services.&quot; (emphasis added) (See: CAD, 26
			<lb />
			August 1949, vol. 9, p. 702). Given this limitation, we must take
			<lb />
			extra caution when reviewing the constitutionality of adding
			<lb />
			additional benefits.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			203.
			<lb />
			Article 334 fixed a 10-year time limit on the legislative
			<lb />
			reservations provided in Articles 330 and 332. In the discussion
			<lb />
			regarding draft Article 292, Sardar Hukam Singh said, &quot;we are
			<lb />
			accepting this reservation of seats [in legislative bodies] as an
			<lb />
			unavoidable evil for the present, thought it is only for the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes and scheduled tribes.&quot; (See: p. 645,
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 9, 24 August 1949).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			204.
			<lb />
			Shri Singh&apos;s comment sums up the limitations on legislative
			<lb />
			reservation. OBC/SEBCs were excluded, and reservations were
			<lb />
			limited in time. Unlike the legislative reservations, Article 16(4)
			<lb />
			contains no fixed time limit. It does, however, preclude the State
			<lb />
			from making reservations in Government service if the backward
			<lb />
			classes are adequately represented.
			<lb />
			The idea is that, at some
			<lb />
			point in time, the backward classes would no longer need
			<lb />
			reservations.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			205.
			<lb />
			In discussing draft Article 10 (Article 16(4) of the
			<lb />
			Constitution), Pandit Hirday Nath Kunzru stated:
			<lb />
			&quot;We are all aware that when the Report of the
			<lb />
			Minorities Committee was considered by the House,
			<lb />
			the entire House was anxious that reservations of
			<lb />
			whatever kind should be done away with as quickly
			<lb />
			as possible. \005 whatever protection might be
			<lb />
			considered necessary now, should be granted
			<lb />
			temporarily only, so that the population of the county
			<lb />
			might become fully integrated, and no community or
			<lb />
			class might be tempted to claim special advantage for
			<lb />
			itself.&quot; (CAD Vol.7 dated 30th November 1948, p.
			<lb />
			681)&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead of moving to remove reservations, the Parliament has
			<lb />
			gone the other way by extending time limits and adding
			<lb />
			beneficiaries. Article 15(5) is just the latest example.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			206.
			<lb />
			While the original Framers went out of their way to put
			<lb />
			SC/ST in the Parliament and State Assemblies and
			<lb />
			SC/ST/backward classes in Government service, they did not
			<lb />
			reserve a single classroom seat. Instead, Article 29(2) prohibited
			<lb />
			caste-based discrimination in admissions, and Article 15(2)
			<lb />
			prohibited caste-based discrimination in general. Education was
			<lb />
			to remain reservation-free.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			207.
			<lb />
			When preferential treatment was given in regard to
			<lb />
			education, it was limited to educational grants. There was no
			<lb />
			question of doling out reservations for special groups. Article
			<lb />
			337 provided educational grants to Anglo-Indian schools for the
			<lb />
			benefit of that community. In the spirit of conciliation, the
			<lb />
			original Framers allowed the grants that were already going to
			<lb />
			those schools to continue for 10 years. (See: p 936-941 of
			<lb />
			Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 8 1949).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			208.
			<lb />
			Rather than advocate for reservation, the original Framers
			<lb />
			preferred free/compulsory education and scholarships. In the
			<lb />
			debate on Draft Article 294, Shri Brajeshwar Prasad stated that
			<lb />
			reservation in legislative bodies would fail to uplift SC/ST.
			<lb />
			Instead, he suggested that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;it should be laid down clearly in express terms that \005
			<lb />
			free education shall be imparted to them. \005 [and] for
			<lb />
			the tribals and Harijans provision must be made in
			<lb />
			the constitution that free agricultural lands should be
			<lb />
			given to them. If we cannot give any one of these, I am
			<lb />
			quite clear in my own mind that by giving them a few
			<lb />
			seats here and there, their economic condition and
			<lb />
			their educational level will in no way be improved.
			<lb />
			(CAD, Vol. 9, 24 August 1948, pages 663-664)&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			209. Shri Prasad&apos;s comments are relevant because he recognizes
			<lb />
			the limited effect of reservation. Rather than reserve seats for a
			<lb />
			few, he advocated for free education for all.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			210.
			<lb />
			In the debate regarding Article 15 of the Constitution, Syed
			<lb />
			Abdur Rouf summed up the essence of the provision: &quot;The
			<lb />
			intention of this article is to prohibit discrimination against
			<lb />
			citizens.&quot; (See: p. 650 of CAD, Vol.7, 29 Nov 1948). This
			<lb />
			intention was only qualified for women and children. In fact, the
			<lb />
			original Framers rejected an amendment that would have
			<lb />
			watered down Article 15&apos;s prohibition against discrimination.
			<lb />
			Prof. K. T. Shah sought special protection for SC/ST. He wanted
			<lb />
			to ensure that Article 15 would allow SC/ST to benefit from
			<lb />
			affirmative action. To this end, he introduced an amendment
			<lb />
			that would have altered 15(3) to read as follows: &quot;Nothing in this
			<lb />
			article shall prevent the State from making any special provision
			<lb />
			for women and children or for the Scheduled Castes or backward
			<lb />
			tribes, for their advantage, safeguard or betterment.&quot; (Shah
			<lb />
			amendment in italics). Prof. Shah proposed the amendment:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005 so that any special discrimination in favour of
			<lb />
			them may not be regarded as violating the basic
			<lb />
			principles of equality for all classes of citizens in the
			<lb />
			country. They need and must be given for some time
			<lb />
			to come at any rate, special treatment in regard to

			Relevant to the instant case, he explains that his

			<lb />
			Dr. Ambedkar disagreed with Prof. Shah on the limited
			<lb />
			ground that it would have given States the green light to
			<lb />
			segregate SC/ST from general category students:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The object which all of us have in mind is that the
			<lb />
			Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes should not be
			<lb />
			segregated from the general public. For instance,
			<lb />
			none of us, I think, would like that a separate school
			<lb />
			should be established for the Scheduled Castes \005 If
			<lb />
			these words are added, it will probably give a handle
			<lb />
			for a State to say, &apos;Well, we are making special
			<lb />
			provision for the Scheduled Castes.&apos; To my mind they
			<lb />
			can safely say so by taking shelter under the article if
			<lb />
			it is amended in the manner the Professor wants it.&quot;

			<lb />
			Dr Ambedkar did not reject the Shah amendment because
			<lb />
			it would have allowed the States to implement affirmative action
			<lb />
			for SC/ST in education. He was concerned that special
			<lb />
			provisions would lead to negative discriminatory action in the
			<lb />
			guise of affirmative action. Whether or not this would have
			<lb />
			happened is unclear, but his concern seems well placed. A
			<lb />
			similar problem arises today, when the general category looks
			<lb />
			down upon or questions the qualifications of SC/ST/OBC
			<lb />
			professionals. Though the individual may have earned
			<lb />
			admission on marks alone, others may presume that reservation
			<lb />
			was a factor. Such a belief, regardless of veracity, cannot bode
			<lb />
			well for the career prospects of SC/ST/SEBCs. Irrespective of
			<lb />
			the reason for which the Shah amendment was rejected, the
			<lb />
			original Framers contemplated special provisions for SC/ST that
			<lb />
			would have included education. At the end of the day, they
			<lb />
			decided that only women and children should benefit from
			<lb />
			discriminatory provisions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			214.
			<lb />
			Article 15(4) and the Shah amendment only differ in that
			<lb />
			Article 15(4) provides special provisions to SC/ST and SEBC,
			<lb />
			while Shah only gave the same to SC/ST. Of course, if the
			<lb />
			original Framers rejected special provisions for SC/ST, they
			<lb />
			would have done the same with respect to SEBC/SC/ST. In
			<lb />
			sum, by limiting Article 15(3) to women and children and
			<lb />
			rejecting an amendment equivalent to Article 15(4), the original
			<lb />
			Framers&apos; intent was clear: no special provisions for backward
			<lb />
			classes (SEBC/SC/ST) in education were to dilute Article 15(1)&apos;s
			<lb />
			prohibition against discrimination based on caste.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			215.
			<lb />
			In the instant case, the Union of India argued that Article
			<lb />
			15(4), the First Amendment to the Constitution, reflects the
			<lb />
			intent of the original Framers because it was passed by the same
			<lb />
			members that drafted the original Constitution. In the
			<lb />
			Parliamentary debates in 1951, Prime Minister Nehru argued in
			<lb />
			favour amending the Constitution. He and other Framers, as
			<lb />
			distinguished from the original Framers who had drafted the
			<lb />
			original Constitution, did not hide their disapproval of
			<lb />
			Champakam Dorairajan (supra). Article 15(4) was to overturn
			<lb />
			that judgment. To justify Article 15(4), which represented a
			<lb />
			dramatic departure from equality as envisaged in Articles 15(2),
			<lb />
			(3) and 29(2), Pandit Nehru said that Article 15(4) would give
			<lb />
			effect to &quot;what \005 was really intended or should be intended.&quot; Yet,
			<lb />
			the original Framers, as explained above, had no intention of
			<lb />
			providing special provisions for SC/ST in education (and a
			<lb />
			fortiori if not for them, nor for SEBC). What &quot;should be intended&quot;
			<lb />
			is a far cry from what they specifically enacted and specifically
			<lb />
			rejected. It follows that Article 15(4) deviated from the original
			<lb />
			Framers&apos; original intent.

			<lb />
			Seeking to remove the blight created by caste, the original
			<lb />
			Framers were social reformers.
			<lb />
			&quot;The social revolution meant &apos;to
			<lb />
			get (India) out of the medievalism based on birth, religion,
			<lb />
			custom, and community and reconstruct her social structure on
			<lb />
			modern foundations of law, individual merit, and secular
			<lb />
			education&apos;.&quot; (See: Granville Austin, Indian Constitution:

			Cornerstone of a Nation at page 26, 1st Ed, 1972, Oxford

			<lb />
			India&apos;s first President Rajendra Prasad assured the Nation
			<lb />
			that the assembly and the Government&apos;s aim was to &quot;end poverty
			<lb />
			and squalor \005 to abolish distinction and exploitation and to
			<lb />
			ensure decent conditions of living&quot;. [Cornerstone at page 27, fn. 5
			<lb />
			(quoting from Prasad in CAD V, I, 2)]. The original Framers took
			<lb />
			steps to abolish caste-based distinction. For example, they
			<lb />
			outlawed untouchability in Article 17, promised all equal
			<lb />
			treatment before the law in Article 14, prohibited discrimination
			<lb />
			based on caste in 15(1) and 29(2) and selected joint over separate
			<lb />
			electorates. The legislative reservations for SC/ST were an
			<lb />
			exception to overarching goal of creating a casteless society; that
			<lb />
			is why they were set to expire in 1960. With respect to
			<lb />
			electorates, Granville Austin explains:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Desiring above all to promote national unity,
			<lb />
			members of the Constitutional Assembly rejected
			<lb />
			these devices by substituting direct elections for
			<lb />
			indirect in lower houses, by rejecting separate
			<lb />
			electorates in favour of joint electorates and by
			<lb />
			abolishing \005 except for Scheduled Castes and Tribes
			<lb />
			\005 reserved seats. The Assembly believed, in Jenning&apos;s
			<lb />
			words, that &apos;to recognize communal claims . . . is to
			<lb />
			strengthen communalism&apos;. [see: Austin, p. 323 of
			<lb />
			Cornerstone.]&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis added)
		</item>
		<lb />
		<item>
			The same can be said today. Reservation based on caste
			<lb />
			strengthens communalism. Non-SEBCs naturally seek SEBC
			<lb />
			status so that they may capture SEBC benefits. Upper castes,
			<lb />
			denied a seat, harbor ill will against lower castes who gain
			<lb />
			admission (whether it was by merit or not).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			218.
			<lb />
			These feelings are the basis for discriminatory action. On
			<lb />
			16 September 2006, The Hindu reported: &quot;While medical
			<lb />
			students at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)
			<lb />
			have complained of caste discrimination, now doctors from the
			<lb />
			reserved category at the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital (GTBH) too
			<lb />
			have written about &apos;biased attitude towards reserved category
			<lb />
			junior residents&apos;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			219.
			<lb />
			Discrimination is not the only problem exacerbated by
			<lb />
			reservation. Given that reserved category students gain
			<lb />
			admission with lower marks, it also stands to reason that they
			<lb />
			would exhibit less confidence in their studies when pitted against
			<lb />
			the general category. In her work on the unintended
			<lb />
			consequences of preferential treatment for minorities in college
			<lb />
			admissions in the United States, Marie Gryphon, a policy analyst
			<lb />
			for the Cato Institute (Washington, D.C.), writes:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005recent research shows that affirmative action
			<lb />
			impedes academic achievement by undermining
			<lb />
			minority students&apos; confidence. \005
			<lb />
			Preferences harm students&apos; self-images, and this
			<lb />
			harm has practical costs in terms of grades and
			<lb />
			graduation rates. Both studies build on earlier work
			<lb />
			by Stanford University sociologist Claude Steele, who
			<lb />
			coined the term &quot;stereotype threat&quot; to refer to the
			<lb />
			decline in performance suffered by members of
			<lb />
			groups who become afraid of confirming negative
			<lb />
			group stereotypes. Steele tested his theory by giving
			<lb />
			standardized exams to groups of white and African-
			<lb />
			American undergraduates at Stanford University.
			<lb />
			Testers told some groups that the exam evaluated
			<lb />
			psychological factors related to testing, and that it
			<lb />
			was not a measure of ability. They told other groups
			<lb />
			that the exam measured their intellectual abilities,
			<lb />
			and in some instances had them indicate their race
			<lb />
			on the exam. The African-American students who
			<lb />
			had been implicitly &quot;threatened&quot; with the stereotype
			<lb />
			of minority academic inferiority did markedly worse
			<lb />
			on the exam than black students in the other groups.
			<lb />
			\005
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			Even minority students who do not need preferences
			<lb />
			respond to an environment characterized by the
			<lb />
			relative academic weakness of minorities by worrying
			<lb />
			about confirming a negative stereotype.
			<lb />
			[Researchers] also determined that vulnerability to
			<lb />
			Claude Steel&apos;s stereotype threat is related to lower
			<lb />
			grades earned by minority students.&quot; (See: p. 9-10

		</p>

		<p>
			The point is that affirmative action produces consequences that
			<lb />
			may outweigh its supposed benefits.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>

			<lb />
			To rid ourselves of reservation and its unintended
			<lb />
			consequences like casteism, we must focus our efforts on
			<lb />
			strengthening education at the primary and secondary level.
			<lb />
			Only then will we achieve the casteless/classless society the
			<lb />
			original Framers envisaged. And only then will there be reason
			<lb />
			to scrap reservation altogether.

			In his speeches to the Parliament regarding 15(4), Prime
			<lb />
			Minister Nehru could not have been clearer: &quot;After all the whole
			<lb />
			purpose of the Constitution, as proclaimed in the Directive
			<lb />
			Principles is to move towards what I may say a casteless and
			<lb />
			classless society&quot; \005 and in an attempt to achieve an egalitarian
			<lb />
			society, &quot;\005 we want to put an end to all those infinite divisions
			<lb />
			that have arisen in our social life; I am referring to the caste
			<lb />
			system and other religious divisions, call them by whatever name
			<lb />
			you like.&quot; (emphasis added).

			<lb />
			June, 1951 and 29 May, 1951 respectively].

			<lb />
			If reservation is allowed, then how can a
			<lb />
			casteless society still be realized?
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			222.
			<lb />
			This raises the issue of how beneficiaries of special
			<lb />
			provisions are to be classified.
			<lb />
			As mentioned above, Mr Salve
			<lb />
			and other learned counsel for petitioners pleaded that the
			<lb />
			Government cannot go forward with the Reservation Act when it
			<lb />
			has yet to identify its beneficiaries. No one can say with certainty
			<lb />
			what percentage of the population is OBC, yet the Government is
			<lb />
			content with giving OBCs 27% of the seats in universities. We do
			<lb />
			not know what proportion of the population is OBC because the
			<lb />
			census does not count OBCs. It has been Central Government
			<lb />
			policy practically since Independence to avoid the question.
			<lb />
			Eminent American Professor Mark Galanter writes that the
			<lb />
			absence of caste data was the deliberate policy of Sardar Patel,
			<lb />
			the Home Minister until 1950. Mr. Patel rejected caste
			<lb />
			tabulation as a device to confirm the British theory that India
			<lb />
			was a caste-ridden country and as an expedient &quot;to meet the
			<lb />
			needs of administrative measures dependent on caste division&quot;
			<lb />
			(See: Professor Marc Galanter, (1978)&quot;Who are the OBCs?&quot; An
			<lb />
			Introduction to a Constitutional Puzzle. 13 Economic and Political
			<lb />
			Weekly 1812 at page 1824 at footnote 78 (quoting from Mr.
			<lb />
			Patel&apos;s 1950 address to the census conference). Taking an OBC
			<lb />
			census is horrifying because it encourages Government to enact
			<lb />
			policy on the basis of caste. Doing so only furthers the caste-
			<lb />
			divide, contrary to our constitutional aim. This has been
			<lb />
			recognized since 1950. If the Central Governments have
			<lb />
			consistently rejected an OBC census because it would promote
			<lb />
			casteism, how can this Central Government make reservation on
			<lb />
			the same ground? It is one thing to ask a citizen his caste, it is
			<lb />
			even worse to grant or reject his college application on that
			<lb />
			ground. The Government is between a rock and a hard place.
			<lb />
			The only way out is to use exclusively economic criteria. This
			<lb />
			would negate the need for a caste-based census while ensuring
			<lb />
			that reservation go to the poor, the group for which the
			<lb />
			Reservation Act was purportedly passed. The Parliament
			<lb />
			eventually settled on enabling States to provide provisions for
			<lb />
			&quot;socially and educationally backward classes.&quot; Article 15(4). This
			<lb />
			Court has interpreted &quot;backward classes&quot; to include caste as one
			<lb />
			of the criteria of classification under Article 16(4). Sahwney I,
			<lb />
			para 859(3)(b). In other words, caste falls under class according
			<lb />
			to Sawheny I, para 859(3)(a).

		<item>

			<lb />
			Economic criteria allows for reservation on
			<lb />
			grounds other than caste:

		</item>

		<p>
			223.
			<lb />
			Despite the goal of a casteless society, the Parliament
			<lb />
			allowed for caste-based reservation and, consequently, caste-
			<lb />
			based discrimination. Ultimately, they subjected Articles 29(2)
			<lb />
			and Article 15 to Article 15(4). Dr. Ambedkar saw no choice but
			<lb />
			to discriminate based on caste, stating that &quot;if you make a
			<lb />
			reservation in favour of what are called backward classes which
			<lb />
			are nothing else but collection of certain castes, those who are
			<lb />
			excluded are persons who belong to certain castes. Therefore, in
			<lb />
			the circumstances of this country, it is impossible to avoid
			<lb />
			reservation without excluding some people who have got a caste.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			224.
			<lb />
			In draft article 10, Dr. Ambedkar tried to reconcile the view
			<lb />
			of those who were in favour of equality of opportunity with the
			<lb />
			demand of certain communities who remained neglected and
			<lb />
			who wanted to have a share in the administration. In doing so,
			<lb />
			he was clear that the concept of equality, which is the very basis
			<lb />
			of democracy, should not be violated. Part of his compromise
			<lb />
			meant that reservation had to remain reasonable. Explaining his
			<lb />
			views on the matter, he said:
			<lb />
			&quot;Supposing, for instance, we were to concede in full
			<lb />
			the demand of those communities who have not been
			<lb />
			so far employed in the public services to the fullest
			<lb />
			extent, what would really happen is, we shall be
			<lb />
			completely destroying the first proposition upon which
			<lb />
			we are all agreed, namely, that there shall be an
			<lb />
			equality of opportunity. Let me give an illustration.
			<lb />
			Supposing, for instance, reservations were made for a
			<lb />
			community or a collection of communities, the total of
			<lb />
			which came to something like 70 per cent of the total
			<lb />
			posts under the State and only 30 per cent are
			<lb />
			retained as the unreserved. Could anybody say that
			<lb />
			the reservation of 30 per cent as open to general
			<lb />
			competition would be satisfactory from the point of
			<lb />
			view of giving effect to the first principle, namely, that
			<lb />
			there shall be equality of opportunity? It cannot be in
			<lb />
			my judgment. Therefore the seats to be reserved, if
			<lb />
			reservation is to be consistent with sub-clause (1) of
			<lb />
			Article 10, must be confined to a minority of seats.
			<lb />
			(see CAD, Vol.7, 30th November, 1948 pp 701-02).&quot;

			<lb />
			On 17th November, 1949, the Constituent Assembly began
			<lb />
			the third reading of the Constitution Bill. While replying to the
			<lb />
			debate, Dr. Ambedkar stated:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;This anxiety is deepened by the realization of the
			<lb />
			fact that in addition to our old enemies in the form of
			<lb />
			castes and creeds we are going to have many political
			<lb />
			parties with diverse and opposing political creeds.
			<lb />
			Will Indians place the country above their creed or will
			<lb />
			they place creed above country? I do not know. But
			<lb />
			this much is certain that if the parties place creed
			<lb />
			above country, our independence will be put in
			<lb />
			jeopardy a second time and probably be lost forever.
			<lb />
			This eventuality we must all resolutely guard against.
			<lb />
			We must be determined to defend our independence
			<lb />
			with the last drop of our blood. (See: CAD on 25th
			<lb />
			November, 1949 pp 977-978)&quot;

			<lb />
			Exhibiting tunnel vision, our First Parliament failed to look
			<lb />
			beyond caste. Another option was available, an option that
			<lb />
			adhered to the original Framers&apos; ideals. Contrary to Dr
			<lb />
			Ambedkar&apos;s view, it was possible to provide reservation to
			<lb />
			backward classes without discriminating based on caste.
			<lb />
			Economic criteria target the poorest of the poor, irrespective of
			<lb />
			caste. As noted, these criteria also simultaneously remove the
			<lb />
			creamy layer.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			227.
			<lb />
			One of the other prominent advocates of reservation later
			<lb />
			realised that the policy did more harm than good. Prime
			<lb />
			Minister Nehru wrote the following letter to the Chief Ministers
			<lb />
			on June 27th, 1961:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;I have referred above to efficiency and to our getting
			<lb />
			out of our traditional ruts. This necessitates our
			<lb />
			getting out of the old habit of reservations and
			<lb />
			particular privileges being given to this caste or that
			<lb />
			group. The recent meeting we held here, at which the
			<lb />
			chief ministers were present, to consider national
			<lb />
			integration, laid down that help should be given on
			<lb />
			economic considerations and not on caste. It is true
			<lb />
			that we are tied up with certain rules and conventions
			<lb />
			about helping Scheduled Castes and Tribes. They
			<lb />
			deserve help but, even so, I dislike any kind of
			<lb />
			reservation, more particularly in service. I react
			<lb />
			strongly against anything which leads to inefficiency
			<lb />
			and second-rate standards. I want my country to be a
			<lb />
			first class country in everything. The moment we
			<lb />
			encourage the second-rate, we are lost.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The only real way to help a backward group is to give
			<lb />
			opportunities for good education. This includes
			<lb />
			technical education, which is becoming more and
			<lb />
			more important. Everything else is provision of some
			<lb />
			kind of crutches which do not add to the strength or
			<lb />
			health of the body. We have made recently two
			<lb />
			decisions which are very important: one is, universal
			<lb />
			free elementary education, that is the base; and the
			<lb />
			second is scholarships on a very wide scale at every
			<lb />
			grade of education to bright boys and girls, and this
			<lb />
			applies not merely to literary education, but, much
			<lb />
			more so, to technical, scientific and medical training. I
			<lb />
			lay stress on bright and able boys and girls. I have no
			<lb />
			doubt that there is a vast reservoir of potential talent
			<lb />
			in this country if only we can give it opportunity.
			<lb />
			But if we go in for reservations on communal and
			<lb />
			caste basis, we swamp the bright and able people and
			<lb />
			remain second-rate or third-rate. I am grieved to learn
			<lb />
			of how far this business of reservation has gone based
			<lb />
			on communal consideration. It has amazed me to
			<lb />
			learn that even promotions are based sometimes on
			<lb />
			communal and caste considerations. This way lies not
			<lb />
			only folly, but disaster. Let&apos;s help the backward groups
			<lb />
			by all means, but never at the cost of efficiency. How
			<lb />
			are we going to build our public sector or indeed any
			<lb />
			sector with second-rate people?&quot;

			are to live and grow from day to day&quot;. In its onward
			<lb />
			march towards realising the constitutional goal, every
			<lb />
			attempt has to be made to destroy caste stratification.
			<lb />
			Article 38(2) enjoins the State to strive to minimise the
			<lb />
			inequality in income and endeavour to eliminate
			<lb />
			inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities, not
			<lb />
			only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of
			<lb />
			people residing in different areas or engaged in
			<lb />
			different vocations. Article 46 enjoins duty to promote
			<lb />
			with special care the educational and economic
			<lb />
			interests of the weaker sections of the people, and in
			<lb />
			particular, of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
			<lb />
			Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice
			<lb />
			and all forms of exploitation. Continued retention of
			<lb />
			the division of the society into various castes
			<lb />
			simultaneously introduces inequality of status. And
			<lb />
			this inequality in status is largely responsible for
			<lb />
			retaining inequality in facilities and opportunities,
			<lb />
			ultimately resulting in bringing into existence an
			<lb />
			economically depressed class far transcending caste
			<lb />
			structure and caste barrier. The society therefore, was
			<lb />
			to be classless casteless society. In order to set up
			<lb />
			such a society, steps have to be taken to weaken and
			<lb />
			progressively eliminate caste structure. Unfortunately,
			<lb />
			the movement is in the reverse gear. Caste
			<lb />
			stratification has become more rigid to some extent,
			<lb />
			and where concessions and preferred treatment
			<lb />
			schemes are introduced for economically
			<lb />
			disadvantaged classes, identifiable by caste label, the
			<lb />
			caste structure unfortunately received a fresh lease of
			<lb />
			life. In fact there is a mad rush for being recognised as
			<lb />
			belonging to a caste which by its nomenclature would
			<lb />
			be included in the list of socially and educationally
			<lb />
			backward classes. ... Rane Commission took note of
			<lb />
			the fact that there was an organised effort for being
			<lb />
			considered socially and educationally backward
			<lb />
			castes. Rane Commission recalled the observations in
			<lb />
			Balaji case [(1963) Supp (1) SCR 439] that &quot;Social
			<lb />
			backwardness is on the ultimate analysis the result of
			<lb />
			poverty to a very large extent&quot;. \005 The Commission
			<lb />
			came to an irrefutable conclusion that amongst
			<lb />
			certain castes and communities or class of people,
			<lb />
			only lower income groups amongst them are socially
			<lb />
			and educationally backward. \005&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			230.
			<lb />
			In this judgment, this Court further observed that if State
			<lb />
			patronage for preferred treatment accepts caste as the only
			<lb />
			insignia for determining social and educational backwardness,
			<lb />
			the danger looms large that this approach alone would legitimize
			<lb />
			and perpetuate the caste system. Caste-based reservation does
			<lb />
			not go well with our secular character as enshrined in the
			<lb />
			Preamble to the Constitution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			231.
			<lb />
			That said, the majority in Sawhney I later sided with
			<lb />
			Justice Chinnappa Reddy&apos;s view: caste can be a factor in
			<lb />
			identifying SEBCs. This view should not hold the day forever.
			<lb />
			Eventually, the words of Justice Desai should be revived.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			232.
			<lb />
			Justice Desai wanted to achieve two goals with one fell
			<lb />
			swoop of the pen. Had his opinion prevailed (1) the creamy layer
			<lb />
			would have been removed ensuring that the truly deserving get
			<lb />
			the benefit and (2) the casteless society would have been
			<lb />
			furthered. To these ends, he would have applied economic
			<lb />
			criteria to remove the creamy layer and simultaneously rid
			<lb />
			reservation of caste.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			233.
			<lb />
			He explained that poverty is the bane of Indian society.
			<lb />
			Given rampant poverty, it comes as no surprise that &quot;\005 the bank
			<lb />
			balance, the property holding and the money power determine
			<lb />
			the social status of the individual and guarantee the
			<lb />
			opportunities to rise to the top echelon.&quot; [Vasanth Kumar at
			<lb />
			para 27]. As a result, the way &quot;\005wealth is acquired has lost
			<lb />
			significance.&quot; And &quot;upper caste does not enjoy the status or
			<lb />
			respect \005 any more even in rural areas what to speak of highly
			<lb />
			westernised urban society.&quot; Finally, his Lordship recognized that
			<lb />
			creamy layer exclusion is inherently linked with identification
			<lb />
			based on economic criteria, i.e., &quot;occupation, income and land
			<lb />
			holdings&quot;:
			<lb />
			&quot;30. \005 If economic criterion for compensatory
			<lb />
			discrimination or affirmative action is accepted, it
			<lb />
			would strike at the root cause of social and
			<lb />
			educational backwardness, and simultaneously take a
			<lb />
			vital step in the direction of destruction of caste
			<lb />
			structure which in turn would advance the secular
			<lb />
			character of the Nation. This approach seeks to
			<lb />
			translate into reality the twin constitutional goals:
			<lb />
			one, to strike at the perpetuation of the caste
			<lb />
			stratification of the Indian Society so as to arrest
			<lb />
			progressive movement and to take a firm step towards
			<lb />
			establishing a casteless society; and two, to
			<lb />
			progressively eliminate poverty by giving an
			<lb />
			opportunity to the disadvantaged sections of the
			<lb />
			society to raise their position and be part of the
			<lb />
			mainstream of life which means eradication of
			<lb />
			poverty.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			234.
			<lb />
			Economic criteria must include occupation and land
			<lb />
			holdings because income alone is insufficient. To decrease the
			<lb />
			likelihood that the undeserving evade identification, it is wise to
			<lb />
			employ more than one criterion.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			235.
			<lb />
			In Vasanth Kumar, Justice Chinnappa Reddy departs from
			<lb />
			Justice Desai&apos;s use of economic criteria as the sole means of
			<lb />
			identification. Nevertheless, he recognizes that &quot; \005 attainment of
			<lb />
			economic equality is the final and only solution to the besetting
			<lb />
			problems.&quot; In Justice Chinnappa Reddy&apos;s opinion, it is easier to
			<lb />
			classify based on caste than economic criteria:
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;80:
			<lb />
			Class poverty, not individual poverty, is therefore
			<lb />
			the primary test. Other ancillary tests are the way of
			<lb />
			life, the standard of living, the place in the social
			<lb />
			hierarchy, the habits and customs, etc. etc. Despite
			<lb />
			individual exceptions, it may be possible and easy to
			<lb />
			identify socially backwardness with reference to caste,
			<lb />
			with reference to residence, with reference to
			<lb />
			occupation or some other dominant feature.
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding our antipathy to caste and sub-
			<lb />
			regionalism, these are facts of life which cannot be
			<lb />
			wished away. If they reflect poverty which is the
			<lb />
			primary source of social and educational
			<lb />
			backwardness, they must be recognised for what they
			<lb />
			are along with other less primary sources.&quot;
			<lb />
			It all depends on how one defines &quot;class.&quot; Once economic criteria
			<lb />
			remove the relatively wealthy families (from all castes and
			<lb />
			communities), a &quot;class&quot; will remain. This &quot;class&quot; is known as
			<lb />
			&quot;the poor.&quot; The class would share the same characteristic,
			<lb />
			irrespective of caste. They would all lack money.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			236.
			<lb />
			In a number of judgments, this Court has spelt out our
			<lb />
			constitutional philosophy regarding caste. On numerous
			<lb />
			occasions, this Court has proclaimed that the cherished goal of
			<lb />
			the Nation is to realise a casteless society. In Shri V. V. Giri v.
			<lb />
			Dippala Suri Dora &amp; Others (1960) 1 SCR 426 at 442, the
			<lb />
			Court observed as under:-
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;\005\005..The history of social reform for the last century
			<lb />
			and more has shown how difficult it is to break or
			<lb />
			even to relax the rigour of the inflexible and exclusive
			<lb />
			character of the caste system. It is to be hoped that
			<lb />
			this position will change, and in course of time the
			<lb />
			cherished ideal of casteless society truly based on
			<lb />
			social equality will be attained under the powerful
			<lb />
			impact of the doctrine of social justice and equality
			<lb />
			proclaimed by the Constitution and sought to be
			<lb />
			implemented by the relevant statutes and as a result
			<lb />
			of the spread of secular education and the growth of a
			<lb />
			rational outlook and of proper sense of social values;
			<lb />
			but at present it would be unrealistic and utopian to
			<lb />
			ignore the difficulties which a member of the
			<lb />
			depressed tribe or caste has to face in claiming a
			<lb />
			higher status amongst his co-religionists. It is in the
			<lb />
			light of this background that the alternative plea of the
			<lb />
			appellant must be considered.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			237.
			<lb />
			In N M. Thomas (supra), a seven Judge Bench observed as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;This consummation is accomplished only when the
			<lb />
			utterly depressed groups can claim a fair share in
			<lb />
			public life and economic activity, including
			<lb />
			employment under the State, or when a classless and
			<lb />
			casteless society blossoms as a result of positive State
			<lb />
			action.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			238.
			<lb />
			In his dissenting opinion, in Sawhney I Justice Kuldip
			<lb />
			Singh observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;339. Secularism is the basic feature of the Indian
			<lb />
			Constitution. It envisages a cohesive, unified and
			<lb />
			casteless society. ... The prohibition on the ground of
			<lb />
			caste is total, the mandate is that never again in this
			<lb />
			country caste shall raise its head. Even access to
			<lb />
			shops on the ground of caste is prohibited. The
			<lb />
			progress of India has been from casteism and
			<lb />
			egalitarianism from feudalism to freedom.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			340.
			<lb />
			The caste system which has been put in the
			<lb />
			grave by the framers of the Constitution is trying to
			<lb />
			raise its ugly head in various forms. Caste poses a
			<lb />
			serious threat to the secularism and as a consequence
			<lb />
			to the integrity of the country. Those who do not learn
			<lb />
			from the events of history are doomed to suffer again.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			239.
			<lb />
			In Akhil Bhartiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh (Railway)
			<lb />
			(supra), it was observed as under::
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;14. These forces nurtured the roots of our
			<lb />
			constitutional values among which must be found the
			<lb />
			fighting faith in a casteless society, not by obliterating
			<lb />
			the label but by advancement of the backward \005
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			240.
			<lb />
			Returning to Vasanth Kumar, one of Justice Reddy&apos;s
			<lb />
			arguments deals with the level of effort required to identify the
			<lb />
			poor compared to the effort expended on identifying caste. In the
			<lb />
			current context, a number of factors, including economic, are
			<lb />
			measured to determine SEBC status. (See: the National
			<lb />
			Commission of Backward Classes&apos; Guidelines for considerations
			<lb />
			of Requests for inclusion and complaints of under-inclusion in
			<lb />
			the Central List of Other Backward Classes).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			241.
			<lb />
			The National Commission for Backward Classes aside, I
			<lb />
			have set out to eventually install a system that only takes
			<lb />
			cognizance of economic criteria. Using purely economic criteria
			<lb />
			would lighten the identification load, as ascertaining caste would
			<lb />
			no longer be required.
			<lb />
			Respondents and others level a common
			<lb />
			criticism against the exclusive use of economic criteria. Most of
			<lb />
			the country is poor.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			242.
			<lb />
			Thus, too many people would be eligible for the benefit.
			<lb />
			This is only a problem if you hand out reservations based on the
			<lb />
			group&apos;s proportion of the total population. Such a reservation
			<lb />
			would be excessively unreasonable and would likely violate the
			<lb />
			Balaji cap of 50% [see M.R. Balaji &amp; Ors. v. State of Mysore
			<lb />
			[(1963) Supp (1) SCR 439]. If economic reservation were limited
			<lb />
			to a reasonable number, it could be upheld.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			243. In addition to the problem of extending the benefit to too
			<lb />
			many, Reddy, J. cannot contemplate the idea of bestowing
			<lb />
			reservation on an economically poor Brahmin. &quot;The idea that
			<lb />
			poor Brahmins may also be eligible for the benefits of Articles
			<lb />
			15(4) and 16(4) is too grotesque even to be considered.&quot;
			<lb />
			He says
			<lb />
			that they are not &quot;socially backward&quot;, thus they should not
			<lb />
			receive the benefit. But can one call a Brahmin sweeper, poor by
			<lb />
			occupation, socially forward? To do so would be a stretch.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			244.
			<lb />
			The majority in Sawhney I reiterates Justice Chinnappa
			<lb />
			Reddy&apos;s message in Vasanth Kumar. They rejected the sole use
			<lb />
			of economic criteria to exclude the creamy layer, deeming it to be
			<lb />
			just one measure of advancement. Justice Jeevan Reddy
			<lb />
			qualified that sentiment to an extent. If income were extremely
			<lb />
			high, it could be the sole factor. In such a case, income alone
			<lb />
			would ensure that one were socially forward. Justice Jeevan
			<lb />
			Reddy was convinced that caste mattered more than money \026
			<lb />
			especially in rural areas. He makes his point by way of example
			<lb />
			at para 792:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;A member of backward class, say a member of
			<lb />
			carpenter caste, goes to Middle East and works there
			<lb />
			as a carpenter. If you take his annual income in
			<lb />
			rupees, it would be fairly high from the Indian
			<lb />
			standard. Is he to be excluded from the Backward
			<lb />
			Class? Are his children in India to be deprived of the
			<lb />
			benefit of Article 16(4)?&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			245.
			<lb />
			Unless the carpenter became a factory owner, where his
			<lb />
			income would be a reflection of his status, Justice Reddy would
			<lb />
			answer his own question in the negative. This is where we part
			<lb />
			ways. Today, the NRI carpenter&apos;s children will have likely
			<lb />
			attended the best schools, tuitions and coaching classes that
			<lb />
			money can buy. These children do not need special provisions.
			<lb />
			That is why I am removing the creamy layer, calling for a time-
			<lb />
			limit on caste-based reservation and urging the Government to
			<lb />
			use exclusively economic criteria to identify OBCs who may avail
			<lb />
			of special provisions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			246.
			<lb />
			The United States Supreme Court has taken a similar
			<lb />
			position with regard to setting a time-limit on race-based
			<lb />
			affirmative action. As mentioned above, Justice Sandra Day
			<lb />
			O&apos;Connor opined that there may be a time-limit to promoting
			<lb />
			diversity via preferential treatment for certain races: &quot;We expect
			<lb />
			that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no
			<lb />
			longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.&quot; (See:
			<lb />
			Grutter at 343).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			247.
			<lb />
			In our context, one need not look past the Parliament&apos;s
			<lb />
			affinity with extending time-limits on reservation to see that only
			<lb />
			the judiciary can put a stop to caste-based reservation. Article
			<lb />
			334 originally said that reservation for SC/ST/Anglo-Indians in
			<lb />
			the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies would expire on
			<lb />
			the Constitution&apos;s tenth birthday. The Parliament later
			<lb />
			substituted &quot;ten&quot; for &quot;thirty years&quot; vide the 45th Amendment.
			<lb />
			When that was to expire, the Parliament extended it for another
			<lb />
			ten years vide the 62nd Amendment. When that was to expire, it
			<lb />
			extended it for another ten years vide the 79th Amendment.
			<lb />
			History has shown that it is not politically feasible for the
			<lb />
			Parliament to say &quot;no&quot; to reservation \026 especially when caste is
			<lb />
			involved.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			248.
			<lb />
			Nevertheless, I have noted that Sawhney I rejects purely
			<lb />
			economic criteria (occupation/income/property holdings/or
			<lb />
			similar measures of economic power) with respect to
			<lb />
			classification under 16(4). [para 859, 4(a)]. Sawhney I&apos;s nine-
			<lb />
			Judge holding precludes us from striking the impugned
			<lb />
			legislation to the extent that it has not yet ruled out the use of
			<lb />
			caste-based criteria for identifying SEBC status. It also
			<lb />
			precludes us from forcing the Government to wean itself off
			<lb />
			caste-based reservation by a certain date. In order to achieve a
			<lb />
			casteless and classless society, after a lapse of ten years, special
			<lb />
			preference or reservation should be granted only on the basis of
			<lb />
			economic criteria as long as grave disparity and inequality
			<lb />
			persist.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>

			<lb />
			Secularism is Part of the Basic Structure
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			249. To be clear, there is no claim arising out of the goal to
			<lb />
			promote a casteless society. No right of action exists. The right
			<lb />
			of action is found in secularism. Though not explicitly found in
			<lb />
			the un-amended Constitution, the original Framers made it clear
			<lb />
			that India was to be a secular democracy. Discrimination based
			<lb />
			on religion is prohibited by Articles 14, 15(1) and 15(2), 16(1) and
			<lb />
			16(2), 29(2) and 325. The original Framers went out of their way
			<lb />
			to ensure that minorities would be able to maintain their
			<lb />
			identity. (See: Articles 28, 29 and 30). Article 27 precludes the
			<lb />
			state from adopting a state religion, whereas Article 25 grants
			<lb />
			citizens the right to profess, practice and propagate religion.
			<lb />
			With rights come responsibilities. One of them is found at Article
			<lb />
			51A(3), which instructs citizens &quot;\005 to promote harmony and
			<lb />
			spirit of brotherhood amongst all people \005 transcending
			<lb />
			religious \005 diversities.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			250. Relying on these provisions, Bommai (1994) 3 SCC 1 at
			<lb />
			para 304 declared secularism &quot;\005.a constitutional goal and a
			<lb />
			basic feature of the Constitution as affirmed in Kesavananda
			<lb />
			Bharati and Indira N. Gandhi v. Raj Narain. Any step
			<lb />
			inconsistent with this constitutional policy is, in plain words,
			<lb />
			unconstitutional.&quot; The Court reasoned that the original Framers
			<lb />
			adopted Articles 25, 26 and 27 so as to further secularism. (See:
			<lb />
			Bommai at para 28 (Ahmadi, J.)). Secularism was very much
			<lb />
			embedded in their constitutional philosophy. [para 29]. During
			<lb />
			the Constituent Assembly Debates, Pandit Laxmikantha Mitra
			<lb />
			stated (as quoted at para 28 of Bommai):
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;By secular State, as I understand it, it is meant that
			<lb />
			the State is not going to make any discrimination
			<lb />
			whatsoever on the ground of religion or community
			<lb />
			against any person professing any particular form of
			<lb />
			religious faith. \005 no citizen \005 will have any
			<lb />
			preferential treatment \005 simply on the ground that he
			<lb />
			professed a particular form of religion.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			This is relevant today because quotas are state-sponsored
			<lb />
			discrimination against those who are not deemed SEBCs -caste
			<lb />
			being a by-product of religion. Though affirmative action is
			<lb />
			allowed, there is a point at which it violates secularism. Finally,
			<lb />
			I note that the 42nd Amendment, which formally inserted
			<lb />
			secularism into the Preamble, merely made what was already
			<lb />
			implicit explicit. (See Bommai at para 29).
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Conclusion on the Casteless Society
			<lb />
			251. In conclusion, the First Parliament, by enacting Article
			<lb />
			15(5), deviated from the original Framers&apos; intent. They passed an
			<lb />
			amendment that strengthens, rather than weakens casteism. If
			<lb />
			caste-based quotas in education are to stay, they should adhere
			<lb />
			to a basic tenet of secularism: they should not take caste into
			<lb />
			account. Instead, exclusively economic criteria should be used.
			<lb />
			For a period of ten years, other factors such as income,
			<lb />
			occupation and property holdings etc. including caste, may be
			<lb />
			taken into consideration and thereafter only economic criteria
			<lb />
			should prevail. Sawhney I has tied our hands. I nevertheless
			<lb />
			believe that caste matters and will continue to matter as long as
			<lb />
			we divide society along caste-lines. Caste-based discrimination
			<lb />
			remains. Violence between castes occurs. Caste politics rages
			<lb />
			on. Where casteism is present, the goal of achieving a casteless
			<lb />
			society must never be forgotten. Any legislation to the contrary
			<lb />
			should be discarded.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			5.
			<lb />
			Are Articles 15(4) and 15(5) mutually contradictory,
			<lb />
			such that 15(5) is unconstitutional?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			252.
			<lb />
			While contradictory, I am able to read them harmoniously.
			<lb />
			Learned senior counsel for petitioners, Mr. K.K. Venugopal,
			<lb />
			argued that Articles 15(5) and 15(4) are inconsistent to the
			<lb />
			extent that 15(5) exempts minority institutions from reservation
			<lb />
			and 15(4) incorporates aided minority institutions in the
			<lb />
			reservation scheme. Because both provisions contain &quot;non-
			<lb />
			obstante clauses&quot;, they render each other void. He further
			<lb />
			submitted that the Court is in the position of having to choose
			<lb />
			between them in regard to this inconsistency. He provided three
			<lb />
			tests of statutory interpretation that give us guidance in
			<lb />
			resolving such a conflict.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			253. First, if the Court cannot harmonize the two provisions, it
			<lb />
			must invalidate the one that completely destroys the other&apos;s
			<lb />
			purpose. Sarwan Singh &amp; Another v. Kasturi Lal (1977) 1
			<lb />
			SCC 750, pages 760-761, at para 20). In the instant case, one of
			<lb />
			the express purposes of 15(5) was to exempt minority
			<lb />
			institutions and thus avoid conflict with Article 30(1). This is
			<lb />
			found in the text of Article 15(5) itself.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			254.
			<lb />
			With nothing in the text of 15(4) to guide us, we turn to its
			<lb />
			Statement of Objects and Reasons:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005\005The Act also amplifies Article 15(3) so as to
			<lb />
			ensure that any special provisions that the State may
			<lb />
			make for the educational, economic or social
			<lb />
			advancement of any backward class citizens may not
			<lb />
			be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory. &quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			255.
			<lb />
			Thus, Article 15(4) was not passed with an express
			<lb />
			intention to include minority institutions; nor did it arise out of a
			<lb />
			case in which minority institutions were a party. Then again, it
			<lb />
			was open to the First Parliament to exclude minority institutions
			<lb />
			from the beginning. Articles 15(4) and 15(5)&apos;s purposes do not
			<lb />
			necessarily conflict. I find the first test inconclusive and thus
			<lb />
			turn to the other ones. The second test asks which provision
			<lb />
			came into effect at a later date (i.e., was &quot;later in time?&quot;)? That
			<lb />
			which is later shall prevail. Here, 15(5) was enacted later in
			<lb />
			time. In J.K. Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Others AIR 1961 SC 1170 at page
			<lb />
			1174, para 9, I find the third test; it provides that the specific
			<lb />
			clause must trump the general. Article 15(5) is specific in that it
			<lb />
			refers to special provisions that relate to admission in
			<lb />
			educational institutions, whereas 15(4) makes no such reference
			<lb />
			to the type of entity at which special provisions are to be enjoyed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			256.
			<lb />
			Because 15(5) is later in time and specific to the question
			<lb />
			presented, it must neutralize 15(4) in regard to reservation in
			<lb />
			education. Mr K. Parasaran, learned senior counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents, correctly pointed out that constitutional articles are
			<lb />
			to be read harmoniously, not in isolation. (See: T.M.A. Pai
			<lb />
			(supra) at page 582, para 148). Our interpretation is
			<lb />
			harmonious because Article 15(4) still applies to other areas in
			<lb />
			which reservation may be passed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			6.
			<lb />
			Does Article 15(5)&apos;s exemption of minority
			<lb />
			institutions from the purview of reservation
			<lb />
			violate Article 14 of the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			257.
			<lb />
			Given the inherent tension between Articles 29(2) and 30(1),
			<lb />
			I find that the overriding constitutional goal of realizing a
			<lb />
			casteless/classless society should serve as a tie-breaker.
			<lb />
			We
			<lb />
			will take a step in the wrong direction if we subject minority
			<lb />
			institutions (even those that are aided) to reservation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			258.
			<lb />
			Minority aided institutions were subject to a limited form of
			<lb />
			reservation. In order to preserve the minority character of the
			<lb />
			institution, reservation could only be imposed to a reasonable
			<lb />
			extent. Minority aided institutions could select their own
			<lb />
			students, contingent upon admitting a reasonable number of
			<lb />
			non-minority students per the percentage provided by the State
			<lb />
			Government. This conclusion was derived from two conflicting
			<lb />
			constitutional articles. Of course, I am only concerned with
			<lb />
			minority aided institutions because I have already determined
			<lb />
			that the State shall not impose reservation on unaided
			<lb />
			institutions (minority or non-minority).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			259.
			<lb />
			Article 30(1) provides that &quot;all minorities, whether based on
			<lb />
			religion or language, shall have the right to establish and
			<lb />
			administer educational institutions of their choice.&quot; Article 29(2)
			<lb />
			states that &quot;no citizen shall be denied admission into any
			<lb />
			educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid
			<lb />
			out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste,
			<lb />
			language or any of them.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			260.
			<lb />
			In other words, 30(1) by itself would allow minority aided
			<lb />
			institutions to reject all non-minority candidates, and 29(2) by
			<lb />
			itself would preclude the same as discrimination based solely on
			<lb />
			religion. Yet neither provision exists by itself. Rather than
			<lb />
			disturb the Constitution, this Court struck a compromise and
			<lb />
			diluted each provision in order to uphold both. Reading Articles
			<lb />
			30(1) and 29(2) harmoniously, Kerala Education Bill provided
			<lb />
			that once minority institutions receive aid, a sprinkling of
			<lb />
			outsiders must be admitted.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			261.
			<lb />
			&quot;Sprinkling&quot; ensured that the minority character of the
			<lb />
			institution would not be lost. In regard to the &quot;sprinkled&quot; seats,
			<lb />
			minority institutions cannot discriminate based on religion in
			<lb />
			violation of Article 29(2). At the same time, if the State compelled
			<lb />
			aided minority institutions to take too many non-minority
			<lb />
			students, the institution would be &quot;minority&quot; in name only. But
			<lb />
			what does &quot;too many&quot; mean? Can &quot;sprinkling&quot; be quantified?
			<lb />
			Clearing up the ambiguity, St. Stephen&apos;s held that minority
			<lb />
			institutions must make 50% of their seats available to outsiders
			<lb />
			and that admission for the other 50% (its own community) must
			<lb />
			be done on merit. Pai later rejected the rigidity attached to this
			<lb />
			fixed percentage. Along these lines, Pai returned to a more
			<lb />
			flexible standard, one akin to &quot;sprinkling&quot; in Kerala Education
			<lb />
			Bill: the moment a minority institution takes aid, it has to admit
			<lb />
			non-minority students to a reasonable extent, whereby the
			<lb />
			character of the institution was maintained and yet citizens&apos;
			<lb />
			Article 29(2) rights were not subverted. (Also see: Pai at para
			<lb />
			149).
		</p>
		<lb />
		<p>
			Thus, two admission pools were created for aided minority
			<lb />
			institutions: minority and non-minority.
			<lb />
			In the minority pool,
			<lb />
			merit was to be observed. From the non-minority pool,
			<lb />
			reservations for the weaker sections may be made while the
			<lb />
			remaining seats, if any, would be distributed based on merit to
			<lb />
			non-minority students.
		</p>
		<lb />
		<item>
			&quot;\005 It would be open to the state authorities to insist
			<lb />
			on allocating a certain percentage of seats to those
			<lb />
			belonging to weaker sections of society, from amongst
			<lb />
			the non-minority seats.&quot; [Pai at para 152].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			262.
			<lb />
			With regard to the percentage of reservation, the State
			<lb />
			Governments were to determine the percentage of non-minority
			<lb />
			seats according to the needs of that State. As a compliment to
			<lb />
			reservation, aided minority institutions were also subject to
			<lb />
			regulation of administration and management. Pai declared at
			<lb />
			para 72 as noted above that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Once aid is granted to a private professional
			<lb />
			educational institution, the Government or the state
			<lb />
			agency, as a condition of the grant of aid, can put
			<lb />
			fetters on the freedom in the matter of administration
			<lb />
			and management of the institution. The state, which
			<lb />
			gives aid to an educational institution, can impose
			<lb />
			such conditions as are necessary for the proper
			<lb />
			maintenance of the high standards of education as the
			<lb />
			financial burden is shared by the state. \005&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			263.
			<lb />
			In addition to the general power to impose conditions that
			<lb />
			seek to maintain high standards or &quot;excellence in education,&quot; the
			<lb />
			State could implement the same under a related but different
			<lb />
			rationale. That is, said regulations could be upheld in the name
			<lb />
			of national interest. [Pai at para 107]. Yet the Government could
			<lb />
			not destroy the minority character of an institution. [para 107].
			<lb />
			Nor could it obliterate the establishment or administration of a
			<lb />
			minority institution. [para 107]. A balance was to be struck
			<lb />
			between (a) maintaining academic quality and (b) preserving the
			<lb />
			minority right to establish/administer educational institutions.
			<lb />
			Regulations that embraced these two objectives were considered
			<lb />
			reasonable. [Pai at para 122].
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			264.
			<lb />
			A question of great import is whether Article 30 was
			<lb />
			designed to put minorities on equal or higher footing than non-
			<lb />
			minorities. This question played out in detail in a debate
			<lb />
			between Khare, C.J. and Justice Sinha in Islamic Academy.
			<lb />
			Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Khare takes issue with
			<lb />
			Pai. The Chief Justice says that Pai has wrongly categorized
			<lb />
			minority rights as equal to those of the non-minority. He has a
			<lb />
			point. Minorities can establish and administer institutions for
			<lb />
			their communities per Article 30; non-minorities cannot. His
			<lb />
			Lordship observed: (para 9 page 723)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;\005We do not read these paragraphs to mean that non-
			<lb />
			minority educational institutions would have the same
			<lb />
			rights as those conferred on minority educational
			<lb />
			institutions by Article 30 of the Constitution of India.
			<lb />
			Non-minority educational institutions do not have the
			<lb />
			protection of Article
		</item>

		<p>
			30. Thus, in certain matters they
			<lb />
			cannot and do not stand on a similar footing as
			<lb />
			minority educational institutions. Even though the
			<lb />
			principle behind Article 30 is to ensure that the
			<lb />
			minorities are protected and are given an equal
			<lb />
			treatment yet the special right given under Article 30
			<lb />
			does give them certain advantages\005&quot;
			<lb />
			Relying on St. Xavier&apos;s case (1975) 1 SCR 173, Pai concluded
			<lb />
			that the object of Article 30 was to ensure minorities of equal
			<lb />
			treatment and nothing more.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			265.
			<lb />
			It was observed in St. Xaviers College case, at page 192,
			<lb />
			that &quot;the whole object of conferring the right on minorities under
			<lb />
			Article 30 is to ensure that there will be equality between the
			<lb />
			majority and the minority. If the minorities do not have such
			<lb />
			special protection, they will be denied equality.&quot; The minority
			<lb />
			institutions must be allowed to do what the non-minority
			<lb />
			institutions are permitted to do. [Pai at para 138].
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			266. In contrast to the majority in Islamic, Justice Sinha
			<lb />
			concludes that Article 30(1) raises minorities to an equal
			<lb />
			platform and no higher. Relevant portion is reproduced
			<lb />
			hereinbelow:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The statement of law contained in paras 138
			<lb />
			and 139 is absolutely clear and unambiguous and no
			<lb />
			exception can be taken thereto. The doubt, if any, that
			<lb />
			the minorities have a higher right in terms of Article
			<lb />
			30(1) of the Constitution of India may be dispelled in
			<lb />
			clearest terms inasmuch as the right of the minorities
			<lb />
			and non-minorities is equal. Only certain additional
			<lb />
			protection has been conferred under Article 30(1) of
			<lb />
			the &apos;Constitution of India to bring the minorities on
			<lb />
			the same platform as that of non-minorities as regards
			<lb />
			the right to establish and administer an educational
			<lb />
			institution for the purpose of imparting education to
			<lb />
			members of their own community whether based on
			<lb />
			religion or language. [see: Islamic Academy at para
			<lb />
			105].&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			267.
			<lb />
			Justice Sinha considers it constitutionally immoral to
			<lb />
			discriminate against non-minorities in the guise of protecting the
			<lb />
			constitutional rights of minorities. [See: Islamic Academy at
			<lb />
			para 118]. Even in the face of Articles that provide preferential
			<lb />
			treatment to minority or weaker sections, e.g., 30(1), 15(4) and
			<lb />
			16(4), the right to equality must mean something.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			268.
			<lb />
			Justice Khare, as he then was, concludes that original
			<lb />
			Framers conferred Article 30(1) on minorities in order to instill in
			<lb />
			them a sense of confidence and security. [Pai at page 615 at
			<lb />
			para 229]. Their right to establish and administer educational
			<lb />
			institutions could not be usurped by mere legislation. Khare, J.
			<lb />
			stated at para 229 p.615:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Thus, while maintaining the rule of non-
			<lb />
			discrimination envisaged by Article
			<lb />
			29(2), the
			<lb />
			minorities should have also right to give preference to
			<lb />
			the students of their own community in the matter of
			<lb />
			admission in their own institution. Otherwise, there
			<lb />
			would be no meaningful purpose of Article 30(1) in the
			<lb />
			Constitution. True, the receipt of State aid makes it
			<lb />
			obligatory on the minority educational institution to
			<lb />
			keep the institution open to non-minority students
			<lb />
			without discrimination on the specified grounds. But,
			<lb />
			to hold that the receipt of State aid completely
			<lb />
			disentitles the management of minority educational
			<lb />
			institutions from admitting students of their
			<lb />
			community to any extent will be to denude the essence
			<lb />
			of Article 30 of the Constitution. It is, therefore,
			<lb />
			necessary that the minority be given preferential rights
			<lb />
			to admit students of their own community in their own
			<lb />
			institutions in a reasonable measure otherwise there
			<lb />
			would be no meaningful purpose of Article 30 in the
			<lb />
			Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			269.
			<lb />
			Minorities possess one right or privilege that non-minorities
			<lb />
			do not: establishing and administering institutions for their
			<lb />
			community. The right to admit your own students in aided
			<lb />
			minority institutions was subject to admitting a reasonable
			<lb />
			number of outsiders. In the instant case, aided minority
			<lb />
			institutions stand to benefit from the Reservation Act: instead of
			<lb />
			having to admit a reasonable number of outsiders they would be
			<lb />
			exempted from reservation. However, their non-minority
			<lb />
			counterparts would not. Does this elevate their status? While it
			<lb />
			does to a certain extent, however, we must also keep our
			<lb />
			constitutional goal and philosophy in mind. Given the ultimate
			<lb />
			goal of furthering a classless/casteless society, there is no need
			<lb />
			to go out on a limb and rewrite them into the Amendment. Such
			<lb />
			a ruling would subject even more institutions to caste-based
			<lb />
			reservation. This would be a step back for the Nation, furthering
			<lb />
			the caste divide. I refuse to go in that direction.

			&quot;Society progresses only by exchange of thoughts and

			ideas. Imagine what a sorry state the world would
			<lb />
			have been in had not thoughts and ideas spread to all

			corners of the globe. Throughout history,
			<lb />
			philosophers, reformers, thinkers, and scholars have

			recorded their thoughts, regardless of whether they
			<lb />
			were accepted or not in their times, and thus
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Is the impugned legislation invalid as it fails to
			<lb />
			set a time-limit for caste-based reservation?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			272.
			<lb />
			It is not invalid because it fails to set a time-limit. Given the
			<lb />
			Parliament&apos;s history of extending time-limits on other reservation
			<lb />
			schemes, there is much force to the argument that the
			<lb />
			Parliament will forever continue to extend reservations. As noted
			<lb />
			above, it is consistent with our constitutional goal of achieving a
			<lb />
			classless/casteless society that a time-limit be set. But I am
			<lb />
			bound by Sawhney I and believe that only a larger bench could
			<lb />
			make such a ruling. A larger bench could certainly hold that
			<lb />
			only economic criteria could be used to identify SEBCs and that
			<lb />
			it should be done by a certain date.

			10) At what point is a student no longer
			<lb />
			Educationally Backward and thus no longer

			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			273.
			<lb />
			Once a candidate graduates from a university, he must be
			<lb />
			considered educationally forward. Senior counsel for petitioners,
			<lb />
			Mr. P.P. Rao, contended that those who have completed Plus 2
			<lb />
			should be considered educationally forward. In other words,
			<lb />
			they would no longer be eligible for reservation in university or
			<lb />
			post-graduate studies. There is some force in this argument
			<lb />
			where only 18% in the relevant age-group have completed Plus 2.
			<lb />
			From this vantage point, this means that they are educationally
			<lb />
			elite. But the answer to most questions in law is not so simple.
			<lb />
			The answer often depends on the circumstances surrounding the
			<lb />
			issue. In the marketplace, a candidate who has completed
			<lb />
			higher secondary education cannot be considered &quot;forward&quot;. The
			<lb />
			real value of the higher secondary degree is that it is a
			<lb />
			prerequisite for college admissions. The general quality of
			<lb />
			education imparted upto Plus 2 is of extremely indifferent quality
			<lb />
			and apart from that, today some entry-level Government
			<lb />
			positions only accept college graduates. One is educationally
			<lb />
			backward until the candidate has graduated from a university.
			<lb />
			Once he has, he shall no longer enjoy the benefits of reservation.
			<lb />
			He is then deemed educationally forward. For admission into
			<lb />
			Master&apos;s programmes, such as, Master of Engineering, Master of
			<lb />
			Laws, Master of Arts etc., none will be a fortiori eligible for
			<lb />
			special benefits for admission into post graduation or any further
			<lb />
			studies thereafter.

		<p>
			274.
			<lb />
			Balaji (supra) concluded that reservation must be
			<lb />
			reasonable. The Oversight Committee has made a
			<lb />
			recommendation that will ensure the same. At page 34 of
			<lb />
			Volume I of its Report, the Oversight Committee recommended
			<lb />
			that institutions of excellence set their own cut off marks such
			<lb />
			that quality is not completely compromised.
			<lb />
			Cut offs or
			<lb />
			admission thresholds as suggested by the Oversight Committee
			<lb />
			are reproduced:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;4.4.2 The Committee recognizes that those
			<lb />
			institutions of higher learning which have established
			<lb />
			a global reputation (e.g. IITs, IIMs, IISc, AIIMS and
			<lb />
			other such exceptional quality institutions), can only
			<lb />
			maintain that if the highest quality in both faculty and
			<lb />
			students is ensured. Therefore, the committee
			<lb />
			recommends that the threshold for admission should
			<lb />
			be determined by the respective institutions alone, as
			<lb />
			is done today, so that the level of its excellence is not
			<lb />
			compromised at all.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			4.4.3
			<lb />
			As regards &apos;cut-offs&apos; in institutions
			<lb />
			other than those mentioned in para 7, these may be
			<lb />
			placed somewhere midway between those for SC/ST
			<lb />
			and the unreserved category, carefully, calibrated so
			<lb />
			that the principles of both equity and excellence can
			<lb />
			be maintained.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			4.4.4
			<lb />
			The Committee strongly feels that the
			<lb />
			students who currently tend to get excluded must be
			<lb />
			given every single opportunity to raise their own levels
			<lb />
			of attainment, so that they can reach their true
			<lb />
			potential. The Government should invest heavily in
			<lb />
			creating powerful, well designed and executed
			<lb />
			remedial preparatory measures to achieve this
			<lb />
			objective fully.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			275.
			<lb />
			Standards of excellence however should not be limited to
			<lb />
			the best aided institutions. The Nation requires that its
			<lb />
			citizens have access to quality education. Society as a whole
			<lb />
			stands to benefit from a rational reservation scheme.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>

			<lb />
			Finding 68% reservation in educational institutions
			<lb />
			excessive, Balaji at pages 470-471 (supra) admonished States
			<lb />
			that reservation must be reasonable and balanced against
			<lb />
			other societal interests. States have &quot;\005 to take reasonable
			<lb />
			and even generous steps to help the advancement of weaker
			<lb />
			elements; the extent of the problem must be weighted, the
			<lb />
			requirements of the community at large must be borne in
			<lb />
			mind and a formula must be evolved which would strike a
			<lb />
			reasonable balance between the several relevant
			<lb />
			considerations.&quot; To strike such a balance, Balaji slashed the
			<lb />
			impugned reservation from 68 to less than 50%.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			277.
			<lb />
			Balaji thus serves as an example in which this Court
			<lb />
			sought to ensure that reservation would remain reasonable.
			<lb />
			We heed this example. There should be no case in which the
			<lb />
			gap of cut off marks between OBC and general category
			<lb />
			students is too large. To preclude such a situation, cut off
			<lb />
			marks for OBCs should be set no lower than 10 marks below
			<lb />
			the general category.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			278.
			<lb />
			To this end, the Government shall set up a committee to
			<lb />
			look into the question of setting the OBC cut off at nor more
			<lb />
			than 10 marks below that of the general category. Under such
			<lb />
			a scheme, whenever the non-creamy layer OBCs fail to fill the
			<lb />
			27% reservation, the remaining seats would revert to general
			<lb />
			category students.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
			<lb />
			1A. Whether the creamy layer be excluded from the
			<lb />
			93rd Amendment (Reservation Act)?
			<lb />
			Yes, it must. The 93rd amendment would be ultra vires and

			1B. What are the parameters for creamy layer
			<lb />
			exclusion?
			<lb />
			For a valid method of creamy layer exclusion, the
			<lb />
			Government may use its post-Sawhney I criteria as a template.

			<lb />
			(See: Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993, para 2(c)/Column 3).

			I urge the Government to periodically revise the O.M. so that
			<lb />
			changing circumstances can be taken into consideration while
			<lb />
			keeping our constitutional goal in view.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			I further urge the Government to exclude the children of
			<lb />
			former and present Members of the Parliament and Members of
			<lb />
			Legislative Assemblies and the said O.M. be amended
			<lb />
			accordingly.

		<item>
			1C. Is creamy layer exclusion applicable to SC/ST?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			In Indra Sawhney-I, creamy layer exclusion was only in
			<lb />
			regard to OBC. Justice Reddy speaking for the majority at para
			<lb />
			792 stated that &quot;this discussion is confined to Other Backward
			<lb />
			Classes only and has no relevance in the case of Scheduled
			<lb />
			Tribes and Scheduled Castes&quot;. Similarly, in the instant case, the
			<lb />
			entire discussion was confined only to Other Backward Classes.
			<lb />
			Therefore, I express no opinion with regard to the applicability of
			<lb />
			exclusion of creamy layer to the Scheduled Castes and
			<lb />
			Scheduled Tribes.
			<lb />
			See para 34.

			<lb />
			Can the Fundamental Right under Article 21A be
			<lb />
			accomplished without great emphasis on
			<lb />
			primary education?
			<lb />
			No, it cannot.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			An inversion in priorities between higher and
			<lb />
			primary/secondary education would make compliance with
			<lb />
			Article 21A extremely difficult. It is not suggested that higher
			<lb />
			education needs no encouragement or that higher education
			<lb />
			should not receive more funds, but there has to be much greater
			<lb />
			emphasis on primary education. Our priorities have to be
			<lb />
			changed. Nothing is really more important than to ensure total
			<lb />
			compliance of Article 21A. Total compliance means good quality
			<lb />
			education is imparted and all children aged six to fourteen
			<lb />
			regularly attend schools. I urge the Government to implement
			<lb />
			the following:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The current patchwork of laws on compulsory education is
			<lb />
			insufficient. Monetary fines do not go far enough to ensure that
			<lb />
			Article 21A is implemented. The Central Government should
			<lb />
			enact legislation that:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a)
			<lb />
			provides low-income parents/guardians with
			<lb />
			financial incentives such that they may afford to
			<lb />
			send their children to schools;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b)
			<lb />
			criminally penalizes those who receive financial
			<lb />
			incentives and despite such payment send their
			<lb />
			children to work;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c)
			<lb />
			penalizes employers who preclude children
			<lb />
			from attending schools;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d)
			<lb />
			the penalty should include imprisonment; the
			<lb />
			aforementioned Bill would serve as an example.
			<lb />
			The State is obligated under Article 21A to
			<lb />
			implement free and compulsory education in toto.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(e)
			<lb />
			until we have accomplished for children from
			<lb />
			six to fourteen years the object of free and
			<lb />
			compulsory education, the Government should
			<lb />
			continue to increase the education budget and
			<lb />
			make earnest efforts to ensure that children go to
			<lb />
			schools and receive quality education;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(f)
			<lb />
			The Parliament should fix a deadline by which
			<lb />
			time free and compulsory education will have
			<lb />
			reached every child. This must be done within
			<lb />
			six months, as the right to free and compulsory
			<lb />
			education is perhaps the most important of all
			<lb />
			the fundamental rights. For without education,
			<lb />
			it becomes extremely difficult to exercise other
			<lb />
			fundamental rights.

			<lb />
			Does the 93rd Amendment violate the Basic
			<lb />
			Structure of the Constitution by imposing
			<lb />
			reservation on unaided institutions?
			<lb />
			Yes, it does. Imposing reservation on unaided institutions
			<lb />
			violates the Basic Structure by stripping citizens of their
			<lb />
			fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) to carry on an
			<lb />
			occupation. T.M.A. Pai and Inamdar affirmed that the
			<lb />
			establishment and running of an educational institution falls
			<lb />
			under the right to an occupation. The right to select students on
			<lb />
			the basis of merit is an essential feature of the right to establish
			<lb />
			and run an unaided institution. Reservation is an unreasonable
			<lb />
			restriction that infringes this right by destroying the autonomy
			<lb />
			and essence of an unaided institution. The effect of the 93rd
			<lb />
			Amendment is such that Article 19 is abrogated, leaving the
			<lb />
			Basic Structure altered. To restore the Basic Structure, I sever
			<lb />
			the 93rd Amendment&apos;s reference to &quot;unaided&quot; institutions.

			<lb />
			Whether the use of caste to identify SEBCs runs
			<lb />
			afoul of the casteless/classless society, in
			<lb />
			violation of Secularism.
			<lb />
			Sawhney I compels me to conclude that use of caste is
			<lb />
			valid. It is said that if reservation in education is to stay, it
			<lb />
			should adhere to a basic tenet of Secularism: it should not take
			<lb />
			caste into account. As long as caste is a criterion, we will never
			<lb />
			achieve a casteless society. Exclusively economic criteria should
			<lb />
			be used. I urge the Government that for a period of ten years
			<lb />
			caste and other factors such as occupation/income/property
			<lb />
			holdings or similar measures of economic power may be taken
			<lb />
			into consideration and thereafter only economic criteria should
			<lb />
			prevail; otherwise we would not be able to achieve our
			<lb />
			constitutional goal of casteless and classless India.
			<lb />
			See paras 194, 195, 231, 248, 251.

			5.
			<lb />
			Are Articles 15(4) and 15(5) mutually
			<lb />
			contradictory, such that 15(5) is
			<lb />
			unconstitutional?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			I am able to read them harmoniously.
			<lb />
			See paras 252-256.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			6.
			<lb />
			Does Article 15(5)&apos;s exemption of minority
			<lb />
			institutions from the purview of reservation
			<lb />
			violate Article 14 of the Constitution?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Given the inherent tension between Articles 29(2) and 30(1),
			<lb />
			I find that the overriding constitutional goal of realizing a
			<lb />
			casteless/classless society should serve as a tie-breaker.
			<lb />
			We
			<lb />
			will take a step in the wrong direction if minority institutions
			<lb />
			(even those that are aided) are subject to reservation.
			<lb />
			See paras 268-269.

			7) Are the standards of review laid down by the U.S.
			<lb />
			Supreme Court applicable to our review of
			<lb />
			affirmative action under Art 15(5) and similar
			<lb />
			provisions?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The principles enunciated by the American Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			such as, &quot;Suspect Legislation&quot; &quot;Narrow Tailoring&quot; &quot;Strict
			<lb />
			Scrutiny&quot; and &quot;Compelling State necessity&quot; are not strictly
			<lb />
			applicable for challenging the impugned legislation.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Cases decided by other countries are not binding but do
			<lb />
			have great persuasive value. Let the path to our constitutional
			<lb />
			goals be enlightened by experience, learning, knowledge and

			thoughts come to us from every side.

			8)
			<lb />
			With respect to OBC identification, was the
			<lb />
			Reservation Act&apos;s delegation of power to the
			<lb />
			Union Government excessive?
			<lb />
			It is not an excessive delegation. With respect to this issue,
			<lb />
			I agree with the reasoning of the Chief Justice in his judgment.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			9)
			<lb />
			Is the impugned legislation invalid as it fails to
			<lb />
			set a time-limit for caste-based reservation?
			<lb />
			It is not invalid because it fails to set a time-limit.
			<lb />
			See para 272.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			10) At what point is a student no longer
			<lb />
			Educationally Backward and thus no longer
			<lb />
			eligible for special provisions under 15(5)?
			<lb />
			Once a candidate graduates from a university, the said candidate
			<lb />
			is educationally forward and is ineligible for special benefits
			<lb />
			under Article 15(5) of the Constitution for post graduate and any
			<lb />
			further studies thereafter.

			<lb />
			Would it be reasonable to balance OBC
			<lb />
			reservation with societal interests by instituting
			<lb />
			OBC cut-off marks that are slightly lower than
			<lb />
			that of the general category?
			<lb />
			It is reasonable to balance reservation with other societal
			<lb />
			interests. To maintain standards of excellence, cut off marks for
			<lb />
			OBCs should be set not more than 10 marks out of 100 below
			<lb />
			that of the general category.
