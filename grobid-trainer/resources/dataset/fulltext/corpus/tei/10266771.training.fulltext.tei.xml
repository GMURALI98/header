			<head>CONTENTIONS RAISED BY LEARNED ADVOCATES<lb/> APPEARING FOR THE PETITIONERS:<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> The learned Senior Advocates along with<lb/> other Advocates appearing for petitioners have made<lb/> elaborate submissions on the constitutional validity<lb/> of the KLGP Act-2011. The sum and substance of<lb/> the arguments canvassed by them can be condensed<lb/> as under:<lb/></p>

			<p>4.1 It is contended that the offence created<lb/> under the Act namely, Section 3 declares land<lb/> grabbing or any activity connected with or arising out<lb/> of land grabbing unlawful; Section 4(1) prohibits land<lb/> grabbing; section 4(2) holds a person who &quot;on or after<lb/> the commencement of this Act continues to be in<lb/> occupation of the grabbed land&quot;; and Section 5<lb/> criminalises offences in connection with land<lb/> grabbing. It is contended that land grabbing as<lb/> defined under section 2(f) consists of several activities<lb/> and it is committed once for all and therefore, it is<lb/> not a continuing offence. It is further contended that<lb/> the activities relating to land grabbing are illegally<lb/> taking possession, entering into and creating<lb/> tenancies,<lb/> leases,<lb/> licences,<lb/> constructing<lb/> unauthorised structures for sale or hire, giving<lb/> grabbed land to any person for rent, lease, licence,<lb/> for construction, use, occupation of unauthorised<lb/> structures. It is contended that land grabber is one<lb/> who commits or committed the offence land grabbing<lb/> prior to Act and Section 9(1) and Section 2(e) makes<lb/> the offence under Section 4(1) retrospective operation<lb/> and Article 21 of the Constitution of India prohibits<lb/> any person to be convicted of any offence if the same<lb/> is not in violation of a law which was not in force at<lb/> the time of commission of the offence. Hence, it is<lb/> contended that Sections 2(e), 3, 4(1) and 9(1) operate<lb/> retrospectively and not being continuing offences, it<lb/> is in clear violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of<lb/> India. It is also contended that Section 5 ought to be<lb/> construed as operating prospectively, whereas,<lb/> Section 9(1) empowers the Special Court to take<lb/> cognizance of all offences under the Act whether or<lb/> before the commencement of the Act, thereby making<lb/> Section 5 retrospective in operation which violates<lb/> Article 21 of the Constitution of India.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.2 It is also contended that the Hon&apos;ble Apex<lb/> Court in SHREYA SINGHAL vs UNION OF INDIA<lb/> reported in (2015)5 SCC 1 has held that a section<lb/> which creates an offence and which is vague must be<lb/> struck down as arbitrary and unreasonable.<lb/> Applying the said principle, petitioners are<lb/> contending that Section 3 does not define or indicate<lb/> the activities connected with or arising out of land<lb/> grabbing and Section 3 being in precise, for sheer<lb/> vagueness, it is to be struck down.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.3 It is also contended that the Special<lb/> procedure contemplated under the Act lays down<lb/> substantially different procedure for trial of offences<lb/> than that is laid down in general law namely, Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure (for short &apos;Cr.P.C.&apos;) and on<lb/> account of said departure, Section 9 is liable to be<lb/> struck down as it violates Article 14. It is contended<lb/> that right of revision provide under Section 397<lb/> Cr.P.C. and right of appeal provide under Section 374<lb/> Cr.P.C. is taken away by virtue of Section 9(3) as the<lb/> orders of the Special Court are final. Hence, it is<lb/> contended that right of appeal in a criminal case<lb/> being a fundamental right, same cannot be taken<lb/> away.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.4 Further contention with regard to<lb/> procedure as prescribed under Section 9 of KLGP<lb/> Act-2011 is attacked on the ground that same<lb/> provides for summary trial and under Section 262 of<lb/> Cr.P.C., no sentence of imprisonment exceeding three<lb/> months shall be passed in case of conviction under<lb/> Chapter XX of Cr.P.C. Whereas, Section 10 of the<lb/> KLGP Act-2011 prescribes that Cr.P.C. will apply to<lb/> act so long as it is not inconsistent with the Act.<lb/> Hence, it is contended that on account of KLGP Act-<lb/>2011 provides for only summary trial, the Act<lb/> prevails over the Code. It is contended that for<lb/> offences under the KLGP Act, it ought to be tried as<lb/> warrant case as otherwise, the accused would be<lb/> deprived of procedure for discharge; liberty to<lb/> summon witnesses in support of defence is curtailed;<lb/> and compensation for accusation without a<lb/> reasonable cause as prescribed under Section 250<lb/> Cr.P.C. would be lost.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.5 It is also contended that the procedure<lb/> prescribed under the KLGP Act-2011 is manifestly<lb/> arbitrary as Section 9(5)(b) of the Act provides that<lb/> offences would be tried summarily and procedure for<lb/> criminal trial is not set out. It is also contended that<lb/> complex question of title cannot be tried summarily<lb/> and therefore, Act is manifestly arbitrary.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.6 By referring to Section 9(4) it is contended<lb/> that civil and criminal proceedings in respect of same<lb/> facts and between same person will be heard in the<lb/> same forum and Special Court having unguided<lb/> discretion to determine the order in which civil and<lb/> criminal liability will be decided and as such, it is<lb/> liable to be struck down.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.7 It is further contended that Section 9(1) of<lb/> the KLGP Act-2011 empowers the Special Court to<lb/> take cognizance even when a private person initiates<lb/> the same and this unguided discretion is manifestly<lb/> arbitrary. It is contended that innocent persons<lb/> would be roped in and definition prescribed under<lb/> Section 2(e) criminalises actions of successors in<lb/> interest of grabbed land and such innocent persons<lb/> lacking requisite mens rea and they can only be held<lb/> responsible for civil consequences flowing from such<lb/> acts and they cannot be held criminally liable.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.8 Learned Advocates have drawn the<lb/> attention of the Court to Section 11 of the Act to<lb/> contend that reverse onus clause has been passed<lb/> namely, evidentiary burden on the accused to<lb/> establish that he/she is not guilty of the offence of<lb/> land grabbing. It is contended that reverse onus<lb/> clause as it stands applies only to class of offenders<lb/> under the Act, inasmuch as, Section 11 only<lb/> prescribes its application to land owned by the<lb/> Government by excluding the land belonging to other<lb/> authorities as prescribed under Section 2(d)(i). It is<lb/> also contended that reverse onus clause under the<lb/> Act violates the right of the accused who is presumed<lb/> to be innocent. It is contended that the reverse onus<lb/> clause as formulated in SHAIKH ZAHID MUKHTAR vs<lb/> STATE AND OTHERS reported in (2017)2 ABR 40<lb/> prescribes four fold tests to determine the<lb/> constitutional validity of a reverse onus clause and<lb/> the Act does not satisfy the said four fold tests and as<lb/> such, it is to be struck down as violative of Article 14<lb/> and 21 of the Constitution of India.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.9 Further submission relates to wrongful<lb/> exclusion of mens rea. It is contended that a crime is<lb/> said to be committed only when criminalized actus<lb/> reus is accompanied by mens rea. Contending that<lb/> members of the general public are not directly<lb/> affected by the offence of land grabbing and as such,<lb/> it cannot be construed as having deleterious<lb/> consequences on public welfare. Hence, contending<lb/> that exclusion of mens rea affects liberty of the<lb/> accused guaranteed under Article 21 of the<lb/> Constitution of India.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.10 It is also contended that Section 16<lb/> violates the doctrine of separation of powers, by<lb/> usurping judicial function and the well settled law<lb/> that legislation can be invalidated on the ground that<lb/> it violates the basic structure of the constitution.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.11 It is further contended that land grabbing<lb/> does not fall under Article 323B(2) of the Constitution<lb/> of India and as such, for lack of legislative<lb/> competence to constitute Special Court, the KLGP<lb/> Act-2011 is liable to be struck down. It is also<lb/> contended that there is no classification found and<lb/> nexus between object of the Act to be achieved and<lb/> there is no intelligible differentia. It is contended that<lb/> impugned Act makes certain class of persons a<lb/> distinct class and affords them with inordinate<lb/> protection, whilst cleaning out protection to private<lb/> person and therefore there is unjust classification<lb/> making ordinary private title suits amenable to the<lb/> jurisdiction of civil courts.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.12 Referring to Section 9 as being manifestly<lb/> error and contending that State has abdicated its<lb/> power to make an application to Special Court being<lb/> delegated to any person or suo motu without any<lb/> limitations is liable to be struck down.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.13 It is also contended that there is no<lb/> statutory responsibility to pass a reasoned prima-<lb/>facie order before taking cognizance which affects the<lb/> right of a party and Section 20 also does not deal<lb/> with order of transfer requiring reasoned order.<lb/> Elaborating on the sequencing of procedure as<lb/> arbitrary and discriminatory, it is contended that<lb/> Section 9(4) allows for sequencing at the whims and<lb/> fancies of the Chairman of the Special Court and as<lb/> such, said provision is liable to be struck down.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.14 It is argued that Section 7(10) provides a<lb/> blanket protection even if there is defect in the<lb/> constitution of the Special Court and Section 7(9)<lb/> does not compulsorily state that a quorum to be<lb/> valid, there should be presence of one Judicial<lb/> member and one Revenue member and therefore,<lb/> between Section 7(8) and 7(9) there is inherent<lb/> contradiction.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.15 Right to fair trial being an important<lb/> facet of Article 21 and resting their oars on this<lb/> Article, it is contended that Section 8 of the<lb/> impugned Act authorises an officer to initiate legal<lb/> action without defining legal action and therefore, on<lb/> the basis of purely subjective opinion of the officer,<lb/> Special Court may take cognizance without regard to<lb/> due process being followed by the officer. Expressing<lb/> that there may be unconscious bias on the part of the<lb/> Chairman on account of discretion granted to him<lb/> under Section 9(4), 9(5) and 8(c) and (d), petitioners<lb/> are seeking for said provisions being struck down as<lb/> violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.16 It is also contended that Section 9 of the<lb/> Act by virtue of Doctrine of Reference has virtually<lb/> incorporated the offence envisaged under Section<lb/> 192-A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 (for<lb/> short KLR Act) and Section 9 cannot have overriding<lb/> effect vis-a-vis Section 192-A.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.17 It is the submission of petitioners that<lb/> Section 9(4) of the Act is inconsistent with Sections<lb/> 40 and 43 of the Indian Evidence Act and same has<lb/> been engrafted in total violation of standard of proofs<lb/> required in a civil and criminal trial.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.18 It is also contended by the learned<lb/> Advocates appearing for the petitioners in some of the<lb/> writ petitions are in possession of the lands as<lb/> morefully described in the petition from long number<lb/> of years and have filed applications under the KLR<lb/> Act, Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest<lb/> Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006<lb/> seeking regularization and during the pendency of<lb/> the said applications they cannot be prosecuted for<lb/> the offence prescribed under the KLGP Act-2011. It<lb/> is also contended that in some of the cases<lb/> petitioners<lb/> have<lb/> been<lb/> in<lb/> continuous<lb/> and<lb/> uninterrupted possession of government land beyond<lb/> 30 years and being in possession of the land would<lb/> not amount to land grabbing, particularly when the<lb/> revenue authorities have themselves recognized the<lb/> possession of petitioners over such lands, it cannot<lb/> be construed that it is an act of land grabbing.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.19<lb/> It is also contended that in respect of<lb/> the grants made in favour of the petitioners or their<lb/> predecessor in title, are being reopened after long<lb/> number of years when the applicants seek for<lb/> mutating the revenue records in the changed<lb/> circumstances like seeking entry on the death of the<lb/> grantee, holder or owner of the land and in such<lb/> circumstances the revenue entries which have been<lb/> in existence from time immemorial is sought to be<lb/> doubted and under that pretext the proceedings<lb/> under the KLGP Act-2011 is being initiated by<lb/> terming the applicants as land grabbers. Hence, the<lb/> settled issues cannot be unsettled after long number<lb/> of years and on the ground of impugned Act being<lb/> onerous, it is liable to be struck down.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.20 It is also contended that the provisions<lb/> of the KLGP Act-2011 are inconsistent with the<lb/> provisions of Limitation Act, 1963 and as such the<lb/> Act as whole is liable to be struck down as<lb/> unconstitutional.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.21 It is contended that the provisions of<lb/> KLGP Act-2011/2014 is inconsistent with existing<lb/> laws like Karnataka Land Revenue Act or Karnataka<lb/> Land Reforms Act or Transfer of Property Act, since<lb/> Section 2(d) of the impugned enactment is pre-fixed<lb/> with<lb/> the<lb/> name<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> title<lb/> holder<lb/> Government/Wakf/Hindu religious and religious<lb/> institutions and charitable endowments, local<lb/> authorities or other statutory or non-statutory bodies<lb/> owned or controlled or managed by the Government.<lb/> Hence, it is contended that prior to commencement of<lb/> proceedings under the impugned Act, two conditions<lb/> ought to have been included under the impugned<lb/> enactment namely, a court or tribunal or authority of<lb/> competent jurisdiction should have determined that<lb/> the subject land is owned by such authority and in<lb/> other words, there should be no determination by a<lb/> court or tribunal or other authority that subject land<lb/> is in the ownership of a private party. It is also<lb/> contended that under Section 4(2) of the impugned<lb/> Act, the proceedings can be commenced before the<lb/> Special Court overlooking the limitation and contrary<lb/> to Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963, where the<lb/> right to a property gets extinguished if a suit for<lb/> possession is not instituted within the time<lb/> stipulated. The attention of the Court is drawn to<lb/> Article 64, 65 and 111 of the Schedule to the<lb/> Limitation Act, 1963 which provide for the period of<lb/> limitation by which, a suit has to be filed.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.22 It is further contended that even in case<lb/> where a final determination either under Section 67<lb/> of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act or Section 48-A<lb/> of Karnataka Land Reforms Act or there being a<lb/> judgment/decree determining title pursuant to<lb/> proceedings initiated before competent jurisdiction,<lb/> even then, by virtue of Section 16 of the impugned<lb/> Act, same can be ignored and this amounts to<lb/> usurpation of the judicial power.<lb/> In support of their submissions, they have<lb/> relied upon the following judgments:<lb/> 1.

			<p>99.AIR 2017 SC 5500 : NIKESH<lb/> TARACHAND SHAH Vs. UNION OF<lb/> INDIA AND ANR.<lb/> CONTENTIONS RAISED BY LEARNED ADVOCATE<lb/> GENERAL:<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> By reiterating what has been urged in the<lb/> statement of objections, the learned Advocate General<lb/> has contended that there is a presumption in favour<lb/> of constitutionality of a statute and judicial review of<lb/> legislation being struck down as ultra-vires of<lb/> constitution can be under three (3) circumstances<lb/> namely, (1) if the legislation is ultra-vires on account<lb/> of legislative competence; (2) if the impugned<lb/> legistation is ultra-vires on account of violation of any<lb/> of the fundamental rights specified in Part-III of the<lb/> Constitution; and (3) if there is manifest<lb/> arbitrariness.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.1 He would contend that impugned Act<lb/> provides for measures to curb organized attempts to<lb/> grab lands, whether belonging to the Government,<lb/> Wakf or the Hindu Religious Institutions and<lb/> Charitable Endowments, local authorities or other<lb/> statutory and non statutory bodies owned or<lb/> controlled or managed by the Government.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.2 He would contend that several persons,<lb/> group of person are indulging in large scale,<lb/> unprecedented and fraudulent sale of lands which<lb/> had been grabbed resulting in large accumulation of<lb/> unaccounted wealth and quick money to land<lb/> grabbers and thereby adversely affecting public order.<lb/> Hence, the appropriate Government found that it was<lb/> necessary and expedient to curb such unlawful<lb/> activity of land grabbing immediately and the<lb/> impugned Act came into being after a joint legislature<lb/> committee submitted its report identifying large and<lb/> vast tracts of government land having been usurped<lb/> by unscrupulous persons. It is also contended that<lb/> said enactment has been duly passed by the<lb/> legislature interalia under Entry 18 and 64 of List II<lb/> of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India<lb/> and for implementation and enforcement of the<lb/> impugned Act the Special Courts have been<lb/> constituted, which has resulted in recovery of 952.32<lb/> acres as on date.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.3 Elaborating his submission he would<lb/> contend that during the pendency of the present writ<lb/> petitions, the State felt the need of amendment to be<lb/> brought in to allay the apprehensions expressed by<lb/> the petitioners and in view of the said amendment<lb/> having been brought by Act 30 of 2020, issue relating<lb/> to trial of cases as warrant cases if felt necessary<lb/> would clearly indicate that apprehensions are ill-<lb/>founded. He would contend that amended Act 30 of<lb/> 2020 has provided sufficient safeguard for dismissal<lb/> of complaint at preliminary stage and if deemed fit<lb/> the Special Court can try a complaint as warrant<lb/> cases instead of summons cases. He would contend<lb/> that once the chapter of summons case is accepted,<lb/> the gravity of the case does not matter. It is not a<lb/> matter of summary trial and the provisions of Cr.P.C.<lb/> would be applicable.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.4 He<lb/> would<lb/> further<lb/> elaborate<lb/> his<lb/> contentions by contending that initial burden is upon<lb/> the Government to prove that lands belongs to the<lb/> Government and then the Special Court presumes<lb/> that person who is alleged is a land grabber. He<lb/> would contend that in modern trend of legislations,<lb/> the burden of proof would be on the accused and the<lb/> impugned legislation having been enacted to protect<lb/> the public properties, the reverse onus cast on the<lb/> accused cannot be held as unconstitutional.<lb/> He<lb/> would draw the attention of the Court to the<lb/> expression &quot;prima-facie&quot; found in Section 11 of the<lb/> impugned Act to contend that initial burden is upon<lb/> the State and only on discharge of the said burden, it<lb/> shifts on the accused.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.5 He would contend that contention of the<lb/> petitioners that provisions under Section 4(2), 9(1)<lb/> and Section 20 of the KLGP Act-2011 being<lb/> retrospective<lb/> in<lb/> nature,<lb/> renders<lb/> them<lb/> unconstitutional is erroneous as offences sought to<lb/> be punished under the impugned Act is continuous<lb/> in nature or in other words, a continuing offence and<lb/> as such, contention of the petitioners are untenable.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.6 He would submit that insofar as the issue<lb/> of limitation raised, would not be a substantive right<lb/> and there is no limitation to be followed and draws<lb/> the attention of the Court to Section 10 of the<lb/> Limitation Act, 1963 to contend that the issue of<lb/> limitation cannot be raised in respect of property<lb/> having been vested in a Trust comprising of religious<lb/> or charitable endowment.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.7 Insofar as contention regarding unbridled<lb/> power being vested with the Special Court under<lb/> Section 9(1), he would contend that the said<lb/> provision is not unregulated and a procedure has<lb/> been prescribed under Regulation 29 of the<lb/> Karnataka<lb/> Land<lb/> Grabbing Prohibition (Special Court) Regulations,<lb/> 2017, whereunder, procedure has been prescribed for<lb/> taking suo motu cognizance. Hence, he contends<lb/> that it cannot be canvassed that the power vested<lb/> under Section 9(1) of the Act is without any<lb/> procedure. He would further submit that Special<lb/> Court is headed for the present by a retired Judge of<lb/> this Hon&apos;ble Court and as such, it cannot be said<lb/> that power of taking suo motu cognizance would not<lb/> be exercised cautiously.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.8 He would contend that in order to<lb/> remedy/curb the grabbing of the Government lands<lb/> and the general public may be sceptical and hesitant<lb/> to lodge complaints being fearful of any repercussions<lb/> against them by a powerful land grabbers, if there<lb/> were publicly seen as whistle blowers or informants,<lb/> the suo motu cognizance power has been given to the<lb/> Special Court. He would also contend that lands<lb/> involved being public lands, it was deemed fit to<lb/> introduce the provision regarding taking suo motu<lb/> cognizance in view of the &quot;public wrong&quot; against an<lb/> indeterminate number of people. He would submit<lb/> that the Act in question being a penal legislation, the<lb/> kind of provisions mentioned therein are very much<lb/> necessary for effective implementation of the Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.9 He would also contend that contention of<lb/> wrongful exclusion of mens rea under the KLGP Act-<lb/>2011 is not a valid contention and draws the<lb/> attention of this Court to NDPS Act, whereunder<lb/> possessing of contraband articles is to be read as<lb/> &quot;possession&quot; with culpable state of mind, in view of<lb/> the object and intent of the said Act. Drawing<lb/> analogy from the said Act, he would contend that the<lb/> intent of the present Act is to reclaim and recover<lb/> public lands and the occupation/act of grabbing by<lb/> the alleged land grabber is to be read as &quot;conscious<lb/> possession&quot; of the act of land grabbing.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.10 He would also submit that the legislation<lb/> in question being a penal legislation, Section 16 has<lb/> been incorporated as individual hardship caused due<lb/> to the enactment of the statute has to give way to the<lb/> larger public interest which is intended to be<lb/> protected by this legislation. Hence, he has prayed for<lb/> dismissal of the writ petitions.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.11 He would also hasten to add that in the<lb/> event of this Court were to arrive at the conclusion<lb/> that any of the provisions are unworkable or loosely<lb/> worded, this court is empowered to read down such<lb/> of the provisions by ironing out the creases, if any, in<lb/> the legislation and it would not warrant striking<lb/> down the legislation.<lb/> In support of his submissions, he has relied<lb/> upon the following judgments:<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> Smt.

She would contend that by the<lb/> impugned legislation, the public property or the<lb/> property belonging to the Government which has<lb/> been usurped or grabbed is sought to be remedied<lb/> not only by prosecuting such persons who have<lb/> indulged in such acts but also reclaim or recover<lb/> such properties.<lb/> She would contend that<lb/> unscrupulous persons who have knocked off the<lb/> property of the State cannot pick loopholes in the<lb/> procedural law and she has contended that<lb/> impugned legislation does not suffer from any vice of<lb/> being discriminatory or arbitrary for being struck<lb/> down. Hence, she has prayed for dismissal of the<lb/> writ petitions. In support of her submissions, she<lb/> has relied upon the following judgments:<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> Having heard the learned Advocates<lb/> appearing for parties, on perusal of pleadings and on<lb/> bestowing our careful and anxious consideration to<lb/> the rival contentions raised at the bar, we are of the<lb/> considered view that following point would arise for<lb/> our consideration:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;Whether the Karnataka Land<lb/> Grabbing<lb/> Prohibition<lb/> Act,<lb/> 2011 (Karnataka Act 38 of<lb/> 2014) and Amendment Act 30<lb/> of 2020 or any of its<lb/> provision requires to be<lb/> struck down on the ground of<lb/> same being violative of the<lb/> Constitution of India?&quot;<lb/> DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS:<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> The Karnataka Legislature constituted a<lb/> joint Legislative Committee during 17.06.2006 to<lb/> examine the issue relating to encroachment of<lb/> Government land in and around Bengaluru and to<lb/> submit a report. Said Committee was headed by then<lb/> member of Legislative Assembly Sri.A.T.Ramaswamy<lb/> as Chairman, which submitted an interim report on<lb/> 01.02.2007 depicting large scale of encroachment of<lb/> Government lands. Another report also came to be<lb/> submitted by the Joint Legislature Committee during<lb/> July, 2007.<lb/> In July, 2009 the Government<lb/> constituted a Task Force for recovery and protection<lb/> of public lands with the object of identifying the<lb/> encroached<lb/> lands<lb/> and<lb/> removal<lb/> of<lb/> such<lb/> encroachment. The said Task Force was headed by<lb/> Sri.V.Balasubramanyam, IAS (Retd), who submitted a<lb/> report stating that thousands of acres of Government<lb/> land had been encroached across the State by<lb/> unscrupulous elements.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.1 Above said two reports had highlighted<lb/> the urgent need for a comprehensive legislation to<lb/> tackle the wide spread encroachment of Government<lb/> lands, perforced the Government of Karnataka to<lb/> bring in the legislation of KLGP Act-2011, to prevent<lb/> illegal and unlawful encroachment of Government<lb/> lands and to proceed against such persons who had<lb/> encroached Government lands, by initiating civil and<lb/> criminal proceedings.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.2 The statement of reasons and the object of<lb/> said enactment would indicate that large scale of land<lb/> grabbing have been going on in and around<lb/> Bangalore and also in the State of Karnataka and<lb/> thousands of acres of Government lands were being<lb/> encroached and usurped by unscrupulous persons<lb/> and there was an urgent need to bring in a<lb/> legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.3 The said enactment has been passed by<lb/> the Legislature under Entry 18 and 64 of List II of the<lb/> VII Schedule of the Constitution of India and had<lb/> received the assent of the President on 09.10.2014<lb/> and as already observed herein above, it has been<lb/> brought into effect from 20.10.2014.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.4 The object sought to be achieved by the<lb/> said enactment and reasons for said enactment being<lb/> brought into force have been elaborated in the<lb/> Statement of Objects and Reasons. It reads:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;It has come to the notice of the<lb/> Government that there are organised<lb/> attempts on the part of certain<lb/> lawless<lb/> persons<lb/> operating<lb/> individually and in groups to grab<lb/> either by force or by deceit or<lb/> otherwise lands belonging to the<lb/> Government, a local authority, a<lb/> religious or charitable institution or<lb/> endowment, including a wakf. The<lb/> land grabbers are forming bogus co-<lb/>operative housing societies or setting<lb/> up fictitious claims and indulging in<lb/> large scale and unprecedented and<lb/> fradulent sales of land through<lb/> unscrupulous real estate dealers or<lb/> otherwise in favour of certain<lb/> sections of people, resulting in large<lb/> scale<lb/> accumulation<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> unaccounted wealth. As public order<lb/> is adversely affected by such lawful<lb/> activities of land grabbers in the<lb/> State, particularly in respect of urban<lb/> and urbanisable lands, the State<lb/> Government has felt that it is<lb/> necessary to curb such unlawful<lb/> activities immediately by enacting a<lb/> special law in this regard.<lb/> Hence, the State Government<lb/> of Karnataka with a view to prohibit<lb/> the activities of land grabbing and to<lb/> provide<lb/> for<lb/> matters<lb/> connected<lb/> therewith has proposed to bring the<lb/> Karnataka<lb/> Land<lb/> Grabbing<lb/> (Prohibition) Act into force. Apart<lb/> from declaring land grabbing as<lb/> unlawful, the State Government<lb/> desires to prohibit land grabbing.<lb/> Therefore, it is proposed to provide<lb/> for penalty for offences in connection<lb/> with land grabbing to effectively<lb/> implement this Act and for the<lb/> purpose of providing speedy enquiry<lb/> into an alleged act of land grabbing<lb/> and trial of cases in respect of the<lb/> ownership and title to, or lawful<lb/> possession of the land grabbed by<lb/> Notification constitute a Special<lb/> Court. It is felt that the State<lb/> Government will be able to curb the<lb/> illegal land grabbing by enforcing the<lb/> proposed legislation.<lb/> Accordingly, the Karnataka<lb/> Bhu Kabalike (Nishedha) Vidheyaka,<lb/> 2007 as passed by both the houses<lb/> the Stat Legislature was sent to<lb/> Government of India to obtain the<lb/> assent of the President.<lb/></item>

			<item>The Government of India in its<lb/> letter No.17/20/2007-Judl and PP<lb/> dated<lb/> 16/20.8.2007,<lb/> on<lb/> the<lb/> suggestion made by the Ministry of<lb/> Corporate Affairs had suggested<lb/> modification to the Karnataka Bhu<lb/> kabalike (Nisheda) Vidyeyaka 2007.<lb/> Accordingly clause 6 of the Bill has<lb/> been modified by incorporating<lb/> Explanation for the word Company<lb/> and Director.<lb/></item>

			<item>The Government of India vide<lb/> letter No. 17/20/2007-Judl &amp; PP<lb/> dated:18-06-2010, had suggested<lb/> modifications to sub-clause (2) of<lb/> clause 2 of the Bill on th suggestions<lb/> made by the Ministry of Minority<lb/> Affairs and also to the sub-clause (2)<lb/> of clause 1 of the Bill on th<lb/> suggestion made by the Department<lb/> of Legal Affairs. Accordingly the State<lb/> Government vide its letter No.DPAL<lb/> 22 SHASHANA 2007, dated 7.9.2020<lb/> Communicated its acceptance to<lb/> make the said modification by<lb/> amending the Bill, by extending the<lb/> provisions to the lands belonging to<lb/> the<lb/> Wakfs,<lb/> Hindu<lb/> Religious<lb/> Institutions<lb/> and<lb/> Charitable<lb/> Endowments and requested the<lb/> Government of India to obtain the<lb/> assent of the President to the said<lb/> Bill and also to obtain previous<lb/> instructions to the modifications to<lb/> be issued in the form of an<lb/> Ordinance.<lb/></item>

			<item>The Government of India vide<lb/> its letter No.17/20/2007-Judl &amp; PP<lb/> dated:03-03-2010/2011 has directed<lb/> the State Government to consider<lb/> withdrawing the present Bill (LA Bill<lb/> No.27 of 2007) and submit a modified<lb/> Bill<lb/> instead<lb/> of<lb/> concurrent<lb/> promulgation of any amendment<lb/> Ordinance.<lb/></item>

			<item>Hence the Bill.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>RE: CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A STATUTE -<lb/>ANALYSIS<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> The courts strongly lean against the<lb/> construction, which reduces the statute to a futility.<lb/> A statute or a provision in the statute would be read<lb/> to make it effective and operative on the principle<lb/> expressed in the maxim ut res magis valeat quam<lb/> pereat viz. &apos;that the thing may avail rather than<lb/> perish&apos;; &apos;that the transaction may be valid rather<lb/> than invalid&apos;. While pronouncing upon the<lb/> constitutionality of a statute the courts would start<lb/> with a presumption in favour of constitutionality and<lb/> prefer the construction which keep the statute within<lb/> the competence of legislature.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. A statute is designed to be workable, and<lb/> the interpretation thereof by a court should be to<lb/> secure that object, unless crucial omission or clear<lb/> direction makes that end unattainable. In the matter<lb/> of FAWCETT PROPERTIES LTD. vs. BUCKINGHAM<lb/> COUNTY COUNCIL reported in (1960) 3 ALL ER<lb/> 503, Lord Denning approving Farewell J stated the<lb/> principle thus:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;But when a statute has some<lb/> meaning even though it obscure, or<lb/> several meanings, even though it is<lb/> little to choose between them, the<lb/> courts have to say what meaning the<lb/> statute is to bear, rather than reject<lb/> it as a nullity.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>11. The Courts would therefore reject that<lb/> construction which will defeat the plain intention of<lb/> the legislature even though there may be some<lb/> inexactitude in the language used.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. The doctrine of purposive interpretation<lb/> may be taken recourse for the purpose of giving full<lb/> effect to the statutory provisions, and the courts<lb/> would state what meaning the statute should bear<lb/> rather than rendering the statute a nullity.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. When the words of a statute are clear,<lb/> plain or unambiguous i.e., they are reasonably<lb/> susceptible to only one meaning, the courts would<lb/> give effect to that meaning irrespective of<lb/> consequences.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in the case of<lb/> STATE OF UTTAR PARDESH vs. VIJAY ANAND<lb/> MAHARAJ reported in AIR 1963 SC 946 has held,<lb/> when a language is plain and unambiguous and<lb/> admits of only one meaning, no question of<lb/> construction of statute arises, for the act speaks for<lb/> itself.<lb/> In KANAI LAL SUR vs.<lb/> PARAMNIDHI<lb/> SADHUKHAN reported in AIR 1957 SC 907 Apex<lb/> Court has held that &quot;if the words used or capable of<lb/> one construction only then it would not be open to the<lb/> courts to adopt any other hypothetical construction on<lb/> the ground that such construction is more consistent<lb/> with the alleged object and policy of the act&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. If one interpretation leads to conflict and<lb/> another leads for harmonious construction, latter<lb/> should prevail as held by the Apex Court in the case<lb/> P.S SATHAPPAN (DEAD) BY LRs vs. ANDHRA<lb/> BANK LIMITED reported in AIR 2004 SC 5152.<lb/></p>

			<p>16. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the case of<lb/> STATE OF BIHAR &amp; OTHERS vs. BIHAR<lb/> DISTILLERY LTD. &amp; OTHERS reported in (1997) 2<lb/> SCC 453 has held that courts should strike down an<lb/> enactment only when it is not possible to sustain it<lb/> and courts would not approach in examining the<lb/> enactment with a view to pick holes or to search for<lb/> defects of drafting and any defects of drafting should<lb/> be ironed out as part of the attempt to sustain the<lb/> validity of the enactment. It has been further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;17. Now coming to the<lb/> reasoning in the impugned judgment,<lb/> we must say with all respect that we<lb/> have not been able to appreciate it.<lb/> The approach of the Court, while<lb/> examining the challenge to the<lb/> constitutionality of an enactment, is<lb/> to start with the presumption of<lb/> constitutionality. The Court should<lb/> try to sustain its validity to the extent<lb/> possible. It should strike down the<lb/> enactment only when it is not<lb/> possible to sustain it. The Court<lb/> should not approach the enactment<lb/> with a view to pick holes or to search<lb/> for defects of drafting, much less<lb/> inexactitude of language employed.<lb/> Indeed, any such defects of drafting<lb/> should be ironed out as part of the<lb/> attempt<lb/> to<lb/> sustain<lb/> the<lb/> validity/constitutionality<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> enactment. After all, an Act made by<lb/> the Legislature represents the will of<lb/> the people and that cannot be lightly<lb/> interfered<lb/> with.<lb/> The<lb/> unconstitutionality must be plainly<lb/> and clearly established before an<lb/> enactment is declared as void. The<lb/> same approach holds good while<lb/> ascertaining the intent and purpose<lb/> of an enactment or its scope and<lb/> application. Now, the result of the<lb/> impugned<lb/> judgment<lb/> is<lb/> that<lb/> the Amending Act has become an<lb/> exercise in futility -a purposeless<lb/> piece of Legislation. And this result<lb/> has been arrived at by pointing out<lb/> some drafting errors and some<lb/> imperfection<lb/> in<lb/> the<lb/> language<lb/> employed. If only the High Court had<lb/> looked into the minutes of the<lb/> meeting dated 15-12-1989 and the<lb/> two letters of the Commissioner<lb/> aforementioned,<lb/> it<lb/> would<lb/> have<lb/> become clear that the Amending<lb/> Act was<lb/> doing<lb/> no<lb/> more<lb/> than<lb/> repeating contents of the said letters<lb/> and<lb/> placing<lb/> the<lb/> legislative<lb/> imprimatur<lb/> on<lb/> them.<lb/> As<lb/> the<lb/> impugned judgment itself suggests,<lb/> part of the imperfection of language<lb/> is perhaps attributable to translation<lb/> from Hindi to English. Indeed, it is<lb/> surprising that the Court has not<lb/> even referred to the long preamble to<lb/> the Act which clearly sets out the<lb/> context and purpose of the said<lb/> enactment. It was put in at such<lb/> length only with a view to aid the<lb/> interpretation of its provisions. It was<lb/> not done without a purpose. To call<lb/> the entire exercise a mere waste is, to<lb/> say the least, most unwarranted<lb/> besides being uncharitable. The<lb/> Court<lb/> must<lb/> recognize<lb/> the<lb/> fundamental nature and importance<lb/> of legislative process and accord due<lb/> regard and deference to it, just as the<lb/> Legislature and the Executive are<lb/> expected to show due regard and<lb/> deference to the judiciary. It cannot<lb/> also<lb/> be<lb/> forgotten<lb/> that<lb/> our<lb/> Constitution recognizes and gives<lb/> effect to the concept of equality<lb/> between the three wings of the State<lb/> and the concept of `checks and<lb/> balances&apos; inherent in such scheme.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>17. It is a trite law that while deciding the<lb/> validity of a statute, the endeavour of the court is to<lb/> find out the intention of the legislature, upon<lb/> considering the various reasons, which gave rise to<lb/> its birth and the mischief which the enactment is<lb/> sought to remedy. Apex Court in the matter of<lb/> BHANUMATI AND OTHERS vs. STATE OF UTTAR<lb/> PRADESH, THROUGH ITS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY<lb/> AND OTHERS reported in (2010) 12 SCC 1 has held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;82. In STATE OF BIHAR vs. BIHAR<lb/> DISTILLERY LTD. this Court in SCC para<lb/> 17 at p. 466: JT para 18 at pp. 865-66<lb/> of the Report laid down certain<lb/> principles on how to judge the<lb/> constitutionality of an enactment. This<lb/> Court held that in this exercise the<lb/> Court should:<lb/></item>

			<item>(a)<lb/> try to sustain validity of the<lb/> impugned law to the extent possible. It<lb/> can strike down the enactment only<lb/> when it is impossible to sustain it;<lb/></item>

			<item>(b) the Court should not approach the<lb/> enactment with a view to pick holes or<lb/> to search for defects of drafting or for<lb/> the language employed;<lb/></item>

			<item>(c) the Court should consider that<lb/> the Act made by the legislature<lb/> represents the will of the people and<lb/> that cannot be lightly interfered with;<lb/></item>

			<item>(d) the Court should strike down the<lb/> Act only when the unconstitutionality is<lb/> plainly and clearly established;<lb/></item>

			<item>(e) the Court must recognize the<lb/> fundamental nature and importance of<lb/> legislative process and accord due<lb/> regard and deference to it.<lb/></item>

			<item>This Court abstracted those principles<lb/> from various judgments of this Court.<lb/></item>

			<item>83. In State of Bihar, this Court also<lb/> considered the observations of Lord<lb/> Denning in Seaford Court Estates Ltd.<lb/> vs. Asher and highlighted that the job of<lb/> a judge in construing a statute must<lb/> proceed on the constructive task of<lb/> finding the intention of Parliament and<lb/> this must be done (a) not only from the<lb/> language of the statute but also (b) upon<lb/> consideration of the social conditions<lb/> which gave rise to it (c) and also of the<lb/> mischief to remedy which the statute<lb/> was passed and if necessary (d) the<lb/> judge must supplement the written word<lb/> so as to give &quot;force and life&quot; to the<lb/> intention of the legislature. According to<lb/> Lord Denning these are the principles<lb/> laid down in Heydon case and is<lb/> considered one of the safest guides<lb/> today. This Court also accepted those<lb/> principles. (See Bihar Distillery Ltd. case,<lb/> SCC para 20 at p. 468: JT para 21 at p.<lb/> 867 of the Report.)<lb/></item>

			<item>84. Reliance was also placed on another<lb/> decision of this Court in Dharam Dutt vs.<lb/> Union of India. This judgment is relevant<lb/> in order to deal with the argument of the<lb/> learned counsel for the appellants that<lb/> in reducing the period for bringing the<lb/> no-confidence motion from &quot;two years&quot;<lb/> to &quot;one year&quot; and then in reducing the<lb/> required majority from 2/3rd to simple<lb/> majority, the legislature was guided by<lb/> the sinister motive of some influential<lb/> Ministers to get rid of a local leader who,<lb/> as a Pradhan of Panchayat, may have<lb/> become very powerful and competitor of<lb/> the Minister in the State.<lb/></item>

			<item>85. In Dharam Dutt this Court held that<lb/> if the legislature is competent to pass a<lb/> particular law, the motives which<lb/> impelled it to act are really irrelevant. If<lb/> the legislature has competence, the<lb/> question of motive does not arise at all<lb/> and any inquiry into the motive which<lb/> persuaded Parliament into passing the<lb/> Act would be of no use at all. (See SCC<lb/> p.730, para 16 of the Report).<lb/></item>

			<item>86. Reliance was also placed on the<lb/> Constitution Bench judgment of this<lb/> Court in State of Gujarat vs. Mirzapur<lb/> Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat. Lahoti, C.J.<lb/> speaking for the Bench laid down in SC<lb/> p. 562, para 39 of the Report that the<lb/> legislature is in the best position to<lb/> understand and appreciate the needs of<lb/> the<lb/> people<lb/> as<lb/> enjoined<lb/> in<lb/> the<lb/> Constitution. The Court will interfere in<lb/> legislative process only when the statute<lb/> is clearly violative of the right conferred<lb/> on a citizen under Part III or when the<lb/> Act is beyond the legislative competence<lb/> of the legislature. Of course the Court<lb/> must always recognize the presumption<lb/> in favour of the constitutionality of the<lb/> statutes and the onus to prove its<lb/> invalidity lies heavily on the party which<lb/> assails it.<lb/></item>

			<item>87. Lahoti, C.J. also laid down several<lb/> parameters<lb/> in<lb/> considering<lb/> the<lb/> constitutional validity of a statute at pp.<lb/> 562-563 of the Report. One of the<lb/> parameters which is relevant in this<lb/> case is, however important the right of<lb/> citizen or an individual may be, it has to<lb/> yield to the larger interests of the<lb/> country or the community.<lb/></item>

			<item>88. Considering all these aspects, this<lb/> Court sees no reason to take a view<lb/> different from the one taken by the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble High Court.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>18. Any law made by legislature can be struck<lb/> down on two grounds namely, (a) lack of legislative<lb/> competence; and (b) violation of any of the<lb/> fundamental<lb/> rights<lb/> guaranteed<lb/> under<lb/> the<lb/> constitution or any other constitutional provision.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the case of<lb/> SHREYA SINGHAL vs. UNION OF INDIA reported in<lb/> (2015) 2 SCC (Crl.) 449 has held that a statutory<lb/> provision can also be invalidated on the ground of<lb/> vagueness, too, which is once again traceable to<lb/> arbitrariness resulting in violation of Article 14 or<lb/> Article 20 of the Constitution. It has been further<lb/> held:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;55. The U.S. Supreme Court has<lb/> repeatedly held in a series of<lb/> judgments that where no reasonable<lb/> standards are laid down to define guilt<lb/> in a Section which creates an offence,<lb/> and where no clear guidance is given<lb/> to either law abiding citizens or to<lb/> authorities and courts, a Section<lb/> which creates an offence and which is<lb/> vague must be struck down as being<lb/> arbitrary and unreasonable. Thus, in<lb/> Musser v. Utah a Utah statute which<lb/> outlawed conspiracy to commit acts<lb/> injurious to public morals was struck<lb/> down.<lb/></p>

			<p>56. In Winters v. New York, a New<lb/> York Penal Law read as follows: (L Ed<lb/> p. 846)<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;1141.<lb/> Obscene<lb/> prints<lb/> and<lb/> articles.<lb/> -(1) A person......who,<lb/></item>

			<item>(2) Prints, utters, publishes, sells,<lb/> lends, gives away, distributes or<lb/> shows, or has in his possession<lb/> with intent to sell, lend, give<lb/> away, distribute or show, or<lb/> otherwise offers for sale, loan, gift<lb/> or<lb/> distribution,<lb/> any<lb/> book,<lb/> pamphlet, magazine, newspaper<lb/> or other printed paper devoted to<lb/> the publication, and principally<lb/> made up of criminal news, police<lb/> reports, or accounts of criminal<lb/> deeds, or pictures, or stories of<lb/> deeds of bloodshed, lust or crime;<lb/></item>

			<item>Is guilty of a misdemeanor,<lb/> .....&apos;&quot;<lb/> The court in striking down the said<lb/> statute held: (L Ed. pp. 851-52)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;The impossibility of defining the<lb/> precise line between permissible<lb/> uncertainty in statutes caused by<lb/> describing crimes by words well<lb/> understood through long use in the<lb/> criminal<lb/> law<lb/> -<lb/>obscene,<lb/> lewd,<lb/> lascivious,<lb/> filthy,<lb/> indecent<lb/> or<lb/> disgusting-and the unconstitutional<lb/> vagueness that leaves a person<lb/> uncertain as to the kind of prohibited<lb/> conduct-massing stories to incite<lb/> crime-has resulted in three arguments<lb/> of this case in this Court. The<lb/> legislative bodies in draftsmanship<lb/> obviously have the same difficulty as<lb/> do the judicial in interpretation.<lb/> Nevertheless despite the difficulties,<lb/> courts must do their best to determine<lb/> whether or not the vagueness is of<lb/> such a character &apos;that men of common<lb/> intelligence must necessarily guess at<lb/> its meaning.&apos; Connally v. General<lb/> Construction Co., U.S. p.391; S.Ct.<lb/> p.127. The entire text of the statute or<lb/> the subjects dealt with may furnish an<lb/> adequate standard. The present case<lb/> as to a vague statute abridging free<lb/> speech involves the circulation of only<lb/> vulgar magazines. The next may call<lb/> for decision as to free expression of<lb/> political views in the light of a statute<lb/> intended<lb/> to<lb/> punish<lb/> subversive<lb/> activities.<lb/></item>

			<item>The sub-section of the New York<lb/> Penal Law, as now interpreted by the<lb/> Court of Appeals prohibits distribution<lb/> of a magazine principally made up of<lb/> criminal news or stories of deeds of<lb/> bloodshed, or lust, so massed as to<lb/> become vehicles for inciting violent<lb/> and depraved crimes against the<lb/> person. But even considering the gloss<lb/> put upon the literal meaning by the<lb/> Court of Appeals&apos; restriction of the<lb/> statute to collections of stories &apos;so<lb/> massed as to become vehicles for<lb/> inciting violent and depraved crimes<lb/> against the person … … not<lb/> necessarily ……. sexual passion&apos;, we<lb/> find the specification of publications,<lb/> prohibited from distribution, too<lb/> uncertain and indefinite to justify the<lb/> conviction of this petitioner. Even<lb/> though all detective tales and treatises<lb/> on criminology are not forbidden, and<lb/> though publications made up of<lb/> criminal deeds not characterized by<lb/> bloodshed or lust are omitted from the<lb/> interpretation of the Court of Appeals,<lb/> we think fair use of collections of<lb/> pictures and stories<lb/> would be<lb/> interdicted because of the utter<lb/> impossibility of the actor or the trier to<lb/> know where this new standard of guilt<lb/> would draw the line between the<lb/> allowable<lb/> and<lb/> the<lb/> forbidden<lb/> publications. No intent or purpose is<lb/> required-no indecency or obscenity in<lb/> any sense heretofore known to the law.<lb/></item>

			<item>&apos;So massed as to incite to crime&apos; can<lb/> become meaningful only by concrete<lb/> instances. This one example is not<lb/> enough. The clause proposes to<lb/> punish the printing and circulation of<lb/> publications that courts or juries may<lb/> think influence generally persons to<lb/> commit crime of violence against the<lb/> person. No conspiracy to commit a<lb/> crime is required. See Musser v. State<lb/> of Utah, this Term. It is not an effective<lb/> notice of new crime. The clause has no<lb/> technical or common law meaning.<lb/> Nor can light as to the meaning be<lb/> gained from the section as a whole or<lb/> the Article of the Penal Law under<lb/> which it appears. As said in the Cohen<lb/> Grocery Co. case, (US at p. 89: S.Ct at<lb/> p. 300): (L.Ed p.520)<lb/></item>

			<item>&apos;….. It leaves open, therefore, the<lb/> widest conceivable inquiry, the scope<lb/> of which no one can foresee and the<lb/> result of which no one can foreshadow<lb/> or adequately guard against.&apos;<lb/> The statute as construed by the<lb/> Court of Appeals does not limit<lb/> punishment to the indecent and<lb/> obscene, as formerly understood.<lb/> When stories of deeds of bloodshed,<lb/> such as many in the accused<lb/> magazines, are massed so as to incite<lb/> to violent crimes, the statute is<lb/> violated. It does not seem to us that an<lb/> honest distributor of publications<lb/> could know when he might be held to<lb/> have ignored such a prohibition.<lb/> Collections of tales of war horrors,<lb/> otherwise unexceptionable, might well<lb/> be found to be &apos;massed&apos; so as to<lb/> become &apos;vehicles for inciting violent<lb/> and depraved crimes&apos;. Where a statute<lb/> is so vague as to make criminal an<lb/> innocent act, a conviction under it<lb/> cannot be sustained. Herndon v.<lb/> Lowry, US p. 259: S Ct p.739.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>57.<lb/> In<lb/> Burstyn<lb/> v.<lb/> Wilson,<lb/> sacrilegious writings and utterances<lb/> were outlawed. Here again, the US<lb/> Supreme Court stepped in to strike<lb/> down the offending Section stating:(L<lb/> Ed p.1121)<lb/> &quot;…. It is not a sufficient answer to say<lb/> that &apos;sacrilegious&apos; is definite, because<lb/> all subjects that in any way might be<lb/> interpreted as offending the religious<lb/> beliefs of any one of the 300 sects of<lb/> the United States are banned in New<lb/> York.<lb/> To<lb/> allow<lb/> such<lb/> vague,<lb/> undefinable powers of censorship to be<lb/> exercised is bound to have stultifying<lb/> consequences on the creative process<lb/> of literature and art-for the films are<lb/> derived largely from literature. History<lb/> does not encourage reliance on the<lb/> wisdom and moderation of the censor<lb/> as a safeguard in the exercise of such<lb/> drastic power over the minds of men.<lb/> We not only do not know but cannot<lb/> know what is condemnable by<lb/> &apos;sacrilegious.&apos; And if we cannot tell,<lb/> how are those to be governed by the<lb/> statute to tell?&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>58. In of Chicago v. Morales, a<lb/> Chicago Gang Congregation Ordinance<lb/> prohibited<lb/> criminal<lb/> street<lb/> gang<lb/> members from loitering with one<lb/> another or with other persons in any<lb/> public place for no apparent purpose.<lb/> The Court referred to an earlier<lb/> judgment in United States v. Reese, US<lb/> at p. 221 in which it was stated that<lb/> the Constitution does not permit a<lb/> legislature to set a net large enough to<lb/> catch all possible offenders and leave it<lb/> to the Court to step in and say who<lb/> could be rightfully detained and who<lb/> should be set at liberty. It was held<lb/> that the broad sweep of the Ordinance<lb/> violated the requirement that a<lb/> legislature needs to meet: to establish<lb/> minimum guidelines to govern law<lb/> enforcement.<lb/> As<lb/> the<lb/> impugned<lb/> Ordinance did not have any such<lb/> guidelines, a substantial amount of<lb/> innocent conduct would also be<lb/> brought within its net, leading to its<lb/> unconstitutionality.<lb/></item>

			<item>59. It was further held that a penal<lb/> law is void for vagueness if it fails to<lb/> define the criminal offence with<lb/> sufficient<lb/> definiteness.<lb/> Ordinary<lb/> people should be able to understand<lb/> what conduct is prohibited and what<lb/> is<lb/> permitted.<lb/> Also,<lb/> those<lb/> who<lb/> administer the law must know what<lb/> offence has been committed so that<lb/> arbitrary<lb/> and<lb/> discriminatory<lb/> enforcement of the law does not take<lb/> place.<lb/></item>

			<p>60. Similarly, in Grayned v.<lb/> Rockford, the State of Illinois provided<lb/> in an anti-noise Ordinance as follows:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;&apos;[N]o person, while on public or<lb/> private grounds adjacent to any<lb/> building in which a school or any class<lb/> thereof is in session, shall willfully<lb/> make or assist in the making of any<lb/> noise or diversion which disturbs or<lb/> tends to disturb the peace or good<lb/> order of such school session or class<lb/> thereof. . . .&apos; Code of Ordinances, c 28,<lb/></item>

			<item>19.2(a).&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>The law on the subject of vagueness<lb/> was clearly stated thus: (Grained case,<lb/> L Ed pp.227 -28)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;It is a basic principle of due<lb/> process that an enactment is void<lb/> for vagueness if its prohibitions<lb/> are not clearly defined. Vague<lb/> laws offend several important<lb/> values. First, because we assume<lb/> that man is free to steer between<lb/> lawful and unlawful conduct, we<lb/> insist that laws give the person of<lb/> ordinary intelligence a reasonable<lb/> opportunity to know what is<lb/> prohibited, so that he may act<lb/> accordingly. Vague laws may trap<lb/> the innocent by not providing fair<lb/> warning. Second, if arbitrary and<lb/> discriminatory enforcement is to<lb/> be prevented, laws must provide<lb/> explicit standards for those who<lb/> apply<lb/> them.<lb/> A<lb/> vague<lb/> law<lb/> impermissibly delegates basic<lb/> policy matters to policemen,<lb/> judges, and juries for resolution<lb/> on an ad hoc and subjective<lb/> basis, with the attendant dangers<lb/> of arbitrary and discriminatory<lb/> application. Third, but related,<lb/> where a vague statute &apos;abut(s)<lb/> upon sensitive areas of basic First<lb/> Amendment<lb/> freedoms,&apos;<lb/> it<lb/> &apos;operates to inhibit the exercise of<lb/> (those)<lb/> freedoms&apos;.<lb/> Uncertain<lb/> meanings inevitably lead citizens<lb/> to &apos;&quot;steer far wider of the unlawful<lb/> zone&quot; .... than if the boundaries of<lb/> the forbidden areas were clearly<lb/> marked.&apos;&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>61. The anti-noise ordinance was<lb/> upheld on facts in that case because it<lb/> fixed the time at which noise disrupts<lb/> school activity -while the school is in<lb/> session -and at a fixed place -<lb/>&quot;adjacent&quot; to the school.<lb/></item>

			<item>62. Secondly, there had to be<lb/> demonstrated a causality between<lb/> disturbance that occurs and the noise<lb/> or diversion. Thirdly, acts have to be<lb/> wilfully done. It is important to notice<lb/> that the Supreme Court specifically<lb/> held that &quot;undesirables&quot; or their<lb/> &quot;annoying conduct&quot; may not be<lb/> punished. It is only on these limited<lb/> grounds that the said Ordinance was<lb/> considered not to be impermissibly<lb/> vague.<lb/></item>

			<item>63. In Reno, v. American Civil<lb/> Liberties Union, two provisions of the<lb/> Communications Decency Act, 1996<lb/> which sought to protect minors from<lb/> harmful material on the internet were<lb/> adjudged<lb/> unconstitutional.<lb/> This<lb/> judgment is a little important for two<lb/> basic reasons -that it deals with a<lb/> penal offence created for persons who<lb/> use the internet as also for the reason<lb/> that the statute which was adjudged<lb/> unconstitutional uses the expression<lb/> &quot;patently offensive&quot; which comes<lb/> extremely close to the expression<lb/> &quot;grossly offensive&quot; used by the<lb/> impugned Section<lb/> 66-A. Section<lb/> 223(d),<lb/> which<lb/> was<lb/> adjudged<lb/> unconstitutional,<lb/> is<lb/> set<lb/> out<lb/> hereinbelow: (US p.860)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;223 (d) Whoever-<lb/>&quot;(1) in interstate or foreign<lb/> communications knowingly-<lb/>(A) uses an interactive computer<lb/> service to send to a specific<lb/> person or persons under 18 years<lb/> of age, or<lb/> (B) uses any interactive computer<lb/> service to display in a manner<lb/> available to a person under 18<lb/> years of age, &apos;any comment,<lb/> request, suggestion, proposal,<lb/> image, or other communication<lb/> that, in context, depicts or<lb/> describes, in terms patently<lb/> offensive<lb/> as<lb/> measured<lb/> by<lb/> contemporary<lb/> community<lb/> standards, sexual or excretory<lb/> activities or organs, regardless of<lb/> whether the user of such service<lb/> placed the call or initiated the<lb/> communication; or (2) knowingly<lb/> permits any telecommunications<lb/> facility under such person&apos;s<lb/> control to be used for an activity<lb/> prohibited by paragraph (1) with<lb/> the intent that it be used for such<lb/> activity,<lb/> shall be fined under Title 18, or<lb/> imprisoned not more than two years,<lb/> or both.&quot;<lb/> Interestingly, the District Court Judge<lb/> writing of the internet said:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;[I]t is no exaggeration to conclude<lb/> that the Internet has achieved,<lb/> and continues to achieve, the<lb/> most participatory marketplace of<lb/> mass speech that this country -<lb/>and indeed the world -as yet<lb/> seen. The plaintiffs in these<lb/> actions correctly describe the<lb/> &apos;democratizing&apos; effects of Internet<lb/> communication:<lb/> individual<lb/> citizens of limited means can<lb/> speak to a worldwide audience on<lb/> issues of concern to them.<lb/> Federalists and Anti-federalists<lb/> may debate the structure of their<lb/> government nightly, but these<lb/> debates occur in newsgroups or<lb/> chat rooms rather than in<lb/> pamphlets. Modern-day Luthers<lb/> still post their theses, but to<lb/> electronic bulletins boards rather<lb/> than the door of the Wittenberg<lb/> Schlosskirche. More mundane<lb/> (but<lb/> from<lb/> a<lb/> constitutional<lb/> perspective, equally important)<lb/> dialogue occurs between aspiring<lb/> artists, or French cooks, or dog<lb/> lovers, or fly fishermen.&quot; American<lb/> Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, F<lb/> Supp at p.881. (at p.425).<lb/></item>

			<item>64. The Supreme Court held that<lb/> the impugned statute lacked the<lb/> precision that the first amendment<lb/> required when a statute regulates the<lb/> content of speech. In order to deny<lb/> minors access to potentially harmful<lb/> speech, the impugned Act effectively<lb/> suppresses a large amount of speech<lb/> that adults have a constitutional right<lb/> to receive and to address to one<lb/> another.<lb/></item>

			<item>65. Such a burden on adult speech<lb/> is unacceptable if less restrictive<lb/> alternatives would be as effective in<lb/> achieving the legitimate purpose that<lb/> the statute was enacted to serve. It<lb/> was held that the general undefined<lb/> term &quot;patently offensive&quot; covers large<lb/> amounts of non-pornographic material<lb/> with serious educational or other value<lb/> and was both vague and over broad.<lb/> It was, thus, held that the impugned<lb/> statute was not narrowly tailored and<lb/> would fall foul of the first amendment.<lb/></item>

			<item>66. In Federal Communications<lb/> Commission v. Fox Television Stations<lb/> Inc., it was held: (S Ct p.2317)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;A fundamental principle in our<lb/> legal system is that laws which<lb/> regulate persons or entities must give<lb/> fair notice of conduct that is forbidden<lb/> or required. See Connally v. General<lb/> Construction Co., US 391 (&quot;[A] statute<lb/> which either forbids or requires the<lb/> doing of an act in terms so vague that<lb/> men of common intelligence must<lb/> necessarily guess at its meaning and<lb/> differ as to its application, violates the<lb/> first essential of due process of law&quot;);<lb/> Papachristou v. Jacksonville, US. 162<lb/> (&quot;Living under a rule of law entails<lb/> various suppositions, one of which is<lb/> that &apos;[all persons] are entitled to be<lb/> informed as to what the State<lb/> commands<lb/> or<lb/> forbids&apos;&quot;<lb/> (quoting<lb/> Lanzetta<lb/> v.<lb/> New<lb/> Jersey,<lb/> US<lb/></item>

			<item>453 (alteration in original))). This<lb/> requirement of clarity in regulation is<lb/> essential to the protections provided<lb/> by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth<lb/> Amendment. See United States v.<lb/> Williams, US 304.<lb/> It requires the<lb/> invalidation<lb/> of<lb/> laws<lb/> that<lb/> are<lb/> impermissibly vague. A conviction or<lb/> punishment fails to comply with due<lb/> process if the statute or regulation<lb/> under which it is obtained &quot;fails to<lb/> provide<lb/> a<lb/> person<lb/> of<lb/> ordinary<lb/> intelligence fair notice of what is<lb/> prohibited, or is so standardless that it<lb/> authorizes or encourages seriously<lb/> discriminatory enforcement.&quot; Ibid. As<lb/> this Court has explained, a regulation<lb/> is not vague because it may at times<lb/> be difficult to prove an incriminating<lb/> fact but rather because it is unclear as<lb/> to what fact must be proved. See id.,<lb/> at 306.<lb/></item>

			<item>Even when speech is not at issue,<lb/> the void for vagueness doctrine<lb/> addresses at least two connected but<lb/> discrete due process concerns: first,<lb/> that regulated parties should know<lb/> what is required of them so they may<lb/> act accordingly; second, precision and<lb/> guidance are necessary so that those<lb/> enforcing the law do not act in an<lb/> arbitrary or discriminatory way. See<lb/> Grayned v. Rockford, US 108-109.<lb/> When speech is involved, rigorous<lb/> adherence to those requirements is<lb/> necessary to ensure that ambiguity<lb/> does not chill protected speech.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>67. Coming to this Court&apos;s<lb/> judgments, in State of M.P. v. Baldeo<lb/> Prasad, an inclusive definition of the<lb/> word &quot;goonda&quot; was held to be vague<lb/> and the offence created by Section 4-A<lb/> of the Goondas Act was, therefore,<lb/> violative of Article 19(1)(d) and (e) of<lb/> the Constitution. It was stated: (SCR<lb/> pp. 979-80 : AIR pp. 297-98, paras 9-<lb/>10)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;Incidentally it would also be<lb/> relevant to point out that the definition<lb/> of the word &quot;goonda&quot; affords no<lb/> assistance in deciding which citizen<lb/> can be put under that category. It is<lb/> an inclusive definition and it does not<lb/> indicate which tests have to be applied<lb/> in deciding whether a person falls in<lb/> the first part of the definition.<lb/> Recourse to the dictionary meaning of<lb/> the word would hardly be of any<lb/> assistance in this matter. After all it<lb/> must be borne in mind that the Act<lb/> authorises the District Magistrate to<lb/> deprive a citizen of his fundamental<lb/> right under Articles 19(1)(d) and (e),<lb/> and though the object of the Act and<lb/> its purpose would undoubtedly attract<lb/> the provisions of Article 19(5) care<lb/> must always be taken in passing such<lb/> Acts that they provide sufficient<lb/> safeguards against casual, capricious<lb/> or even malicious exercise of the<lb/> powers conferred by them. It is well<lb/> known that the relevant provisions of<lb/> the Act are initially put in motion<lb/> against a person at a lower level than<lb/> the District magistrate, and so it is<lb/> always<lb/> necessary that<lb/> sufficient<lb/> safeguards should be provided by the<lb/> Act to protect the fundamental rights<lb/> of innocent citizens and to save them<lb/> from unnecessary harassment. That is<lb/> why we think the definition of the<lb/> word &apos;goonda&apos; should have given<lb/> necessary assistance to the District<lb/> Magistrate in deciding whether a<lb/> particular citizen falls under the<lb/> category of goonda or not; that is<lb/> another infirmity in the Act. As we<lb/> have already pointed out s. 4-A suffers<lb/> from the same infirmities as s. 4.<lb/></item>

			<item>Having regard to the two infirmities<lb/> in Sections 4, 4-A respectively we do<lb/> not think it would be possible to<lb/> accede to the argument of the Learned<lb/> Advocate-General that the operative<lb/> portion of the Act can fall under Article<lb/> 19(5) of the Constitution. The person<lb/> against whom action can be taken<lb/> under the Act is not entitled to know<lb/> the source of the information received<lb/> by the District Magistrate; he is only<lb/> told about his prejudicial activities on<lb/> which the satisfaction of the District<lb/> Magistrate is based that action should<lb/> be taken against him under s.4 or s.<lb/> 4-A. In such a case it is absolutely<lb/> essential that the Act must clearly<lb/> indicate by a proper definition or<lb/> otherwise when and under what<lb/> circumstances a person can be called<lb/> a goonda, and it must impose an<lb/> obligation on the District Magistrate to<lb/> apply his mind to the question as to<lb/> whether the person against whom<lb/> complaints are received is such a<lb/> goonda or not. It has been urged<lb/> before us that such an obligation is<lb/> implicit in Sections 4 and 4-A. We are,<lb/> however, not impressed by this<lb/> argument. Where a statute empowers<lb/> the specified authorities to take<lb/> preventive action against the citizens it<lb/> is essential that it should expressly<lb/> make it a part of the duty of the said<lb/> authorities to satisfy themselves about<lb/> the existence of what the statute<lb/> regards as conditions precedent to the<lb/> exercise of the said authority. If the<lb/> statute is silent in respect of one of<lb/> such<lb/> conditions<lb/> precedent<lb/> it<lb/> undoubtedly constitutes a serious<lb/> infirmity which would inevitably take<lb/> it out of the provisions of Article<lb/> 19(5). The result of this infirmity is<lb/> that it has left to the unguided and<lb/> unfettered discretion of the authority<lb/> concerned to treat any citizen as a<lb/> goonda.<lb/> In<lb/> other<lb/> words,<lb/> the<lb/> restrictions which it allows to be<lb/> imposed on the exercise of the<lb/> fundamental right of a citizen<lb/> guaranteed<lb/> by Article<lb/> 19(1)(d) and (e) must<lb/> in<lb/> the<lb/> circumstances<lb/> be<lb/> held<lb/> to<lb/> be<lb/> unreasonable. That is the view taken<lb/> by the High court and we see no<lb/> reason to differ from it.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>68. At one time this Court seemed<lb/> to suggest that the doctrine of<lb/> vagueness was no part of the<lb/> Constitutional Law of India. That was<lb/> dispelled in no uncertain terms in K.A.<lb/> Abbas v. Union of India: (SCC pp.798-<lb/>99 paras 44-46: SCR pp. 469-71)<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;44. This brings us to the manner<lb/> of the exercise of control and<lb/> restriction by the directions. Here<lb/> the argument is that most of the<lb/> regulations are vague and further<lb/> that they leave no scope for the<lb/> exercise of creative genius in the<lb/> field of art. This poses the first<lb/> question before us whether the<lb/> &apos;void for vagueness&apos; doctrine is<lb/> applicable.<lb/> Reliance<lb/> in<lb/> this<lb/> connection is placed on Municipal<lb/> Committee, Amritsar v. State of<lb/> Punjab. In that case a Division<lb/> Bench of this Court lays down<lb/> that an Indian Act cannot be<lb/> declared invalid on the ground<lb/> that it violates the due process<lb/> clause or that it is vague......&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;These observations which<lb/> are clearly obiter are apt to be too<lb/> generally applied and need to be<lb/> explained. While it is true that the<lb/> principles evolved by the Supreme<lb/> Court of the United States of<lb/> America in the application of the<lb/> Fourteenth<lb/> Amendment<lb/> were<lb/> eschewed in our Constitution and<lb/> instead the limits of restrictions<lb/> on each fundamental right were<lb/> indicated in the clauses that<lb/> follow the first clause of the<lb/> nineteenth article, it cannot be<lb/> said as an absolute principle that<lb/> no law will be considered bad for<lb/> sheer vagueness. There is ample<lb/> authority for the proposition that<lb/> a law affecting fundamental rights<lb/> may be so considered. A very<lb/> pertinent example is to be found<lb/> in State of M.P. v. Baldeo Prasad,<lb/> where the Central Provinces and<lb/> Berar Goondas Act, 1946 was<lb/> declared void for uncertainty. The<lb/> condition for the application of<lb/> Sections 4 and 4-A was that the<lb/> person sought to be proceeded<lb/> against must be a goonda but the<lb/> definition of goonda in the Act<lb/> indicated no tests for deciding<lb/> which person fell within the<lb/> definition. The provisions were<lb/> therefore held to be uncertain and<lb/> vague.<lb/></item>

			<item>The real rule is that if a law<lb/> is vague or appears to be so, the<lb/> court must try to construe it, as<lb/> far as may be, and language<lb/> permitting,<lb/> the<lb/> construction<lb/> sought to be placed on it, must be<lb/> in accordance with the intention<lb/> of the legislature. Thus if the law<lb/> is open to diverse construction,<lb/> that construction which accords<lb/> best with the intention of the<lb/> legislature and advances the<lb/> purpose of legislation, is to be<lb/> preferred. Where however the law<lb/> admits of no such construction and<lb/> the persons applying it are in a<lb/> boundless sea of uncertainty and<lb/> the law prima facie takes away a<lb/> guaranteed freedom, the law must<lb/> be held to offend the Constitution<lb/> as was done in the case of the<lb/> Goonda Act. This is not application<lb/> of the doctrine of due process. The<lb/> invalidity<lb/> arises<lb/> from<lb/> the<lb/> probability of the misuse of the<lb/> law to the detriment of the<lb/> individual. If possible, the Court<lb/> instead of striking down the law<lb/> may itself draw the line of<lb/> demarcation where possible but<lb/> this effort should be sparingly<lb/> made and only in the clearest of<lb/> cases.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>20.<lb/> Essentially, in all these petitions, as<lb/> already noted herein above, the constitutional validity<lb/> of KLGP Act-2011 has been challenged. During the<lb/> pendency of these writ petitions, the State amended<lb/> the Act by Act 30 of 2020 whereunder, certain<lb/> provisions of the KLGP Act-2011 came to be<lb/> amended.<lb/> An interlocutory application for<lb/> amendment of the pleadings and additional prayer<lb/> seeking the amended provisions also being struck<lb/> down has been raised in W.P.No.11975/2018.<lb/></p>

			<p>21. It would be necessary to have a look at<lb/> the provisions of KLGP Act-2011/2014 in order to<lb/> appreciate and adjudicate upon the points canvassed<lb/> by the learned Advocates appearing for parties<lb/> whereunder they have sought for striking down the<lb/> Act both on the ground of same being violative of<lb/> Articles 14, 21 of the Constitution of India and<lb/> arbitrariness being writ large in the said enactment.<lb/></p>

			<p>23. The main thrust of the argument of the<lb/> learned Advocates appearing for the parties as<lb/> noticed herein above, can be sub-divided under the<lb/> following heads namely, the impugned legislation is<lb/> bad, since:<lb/></p>

			<item>(1)<lb/> it is made applicable retrospectively;<lb/></item>

			<item>(2)<lb/> arbitrariness is writ large;<lb/></item>

			<item>(3)<lb/> right of appeal and revision not being<lb/> available, takes away the right of an<lb/> aggrieved person;<lb/></item>

			<item>(4)<lb/> reverse onus clause or burden of proof is<lb/> erroneous and opposed to cannons of<lb/> criminal jurisprudence;<lb/></item>

			<item>(5)<lb/> KLGP ACT-2011 provides for criminal trial<lb/> before the Special Court to be summary<lb/> trial, whereas punishment to be imposed<lb/> under Section 4 of the Act being not less<lb/> than one year and which may extend to<lb/> three years would be contrary to Section<lb/> 262 of Cr.P.C.<lb/></item>

			<item>(6)<lb/> Section 9 of KLGP Act-2011 is hit by<lb/> Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of<lb/> India<lb/> as<lb/> procedure<lb/> prescribed<lb/> is<lb/> unworkable.<lb/></item>

			<item>(7)<lb/> vicarious liability is fixed on a Director of<lb/> company;<lb/></item>

			<item>(8)<lb/> absence of mens rea;<lb/></item>

			<item>(9)<lb/> transfer of cases from Civil Court to<lb/> Special Court under Section 20 takes<lb/> away jurisdiction of Civil Court;<lb/></item>

			<item>(10) though Section 7 mandates constitution<lb/> of Additional Benches across the State,<lb/> same have not been constituted;<lb/></item>

			<p>(11) amendment Act provided for abatement of<lb/> proceedings only in respect of two<lb/> enactments and it is discriminatory.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. Before embarking upon the journey of<lb/> discussion on the above points, it would be necessary<lb/> to analyse the provisions of the Act 38 of 2014 and<lb/> Act 30 of 2020. The definition of certain expression<lb/> as found in KLGP Act-2011 would be relevant for the<lb/> purposes of our discussion and to record finding on<lb/> the aforesaid points, it would be necessary to take<lb/> note of the provisions of the KLGP Act-2011 which<lb/> has bearing on our discussion.

			<p>25. In the light of amendment having been<lb/> brought about to the KLGP Act-2011 by KLGP Act<lb/> 38/2014, as noticed hereinabove, it would be useful<lb/> to have a comparative statement of these two<lb/> enactments insofar as the provisions which came to<lb/> be amended and it reads:<lb/> SL.<lb/> NO.<lb/> ACT 38/2014<lb/> ACT NO.30/2020<lb/></p>

			<head>ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS OF KLGP ACT-<lb/>2011/2020:<lb/></head>

			<p>26. Section 2 of KLGP Act-2011 has 13<lb/> definitions. The words &quot;Land&quot;, &quot;Land grabber&quot;, &quot;Land<lb/> grabbing&quot;, &quot;Local authority&quot;, &quot;Special Court&quot; etc.,<lb/> have been defined under Section 2. Definition of<lb/> &quot;Land&quot; as found in Section 2(d) of the Act is an<lb/> inclusive definition.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. A plain reading of Section 2(d) would<lb/> clearly indicate that such of the &apos;land&apos; belonging to<lb/> the Government, WAKF or Hindu Religious<lb/> Institutions and Charitable Endowments, local<lb/> authority, statutory or non statutory body owned,<lb/> controlled or managed by the Government has been<lb/> included within the definition of the &apos;land&apos;. It also<lb/> includes rights in and over such land, benefits<lb/> arising out of such land, and buildings, structures<lb/> and other things attached to the earth or<lb/> permanently fastened to anything attached to the<lb/> earth would also include within the definition of the<lb/> expression &quot;land&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.1 A &apos;land grabber&apos; as defined under Section<lb/> 2(e) would include a person, group of persons or a<lb/> Society, who commits or has committed the land<lb/> grabbing and includes any person who gives financial<lb/> aid to such person for taking illegal possession of<lb/> lands or for construction of unauthorised structures<lb/> thereon, or who collects or attempts to collect from<lb/> any occupiers of such lands rent, compensation and<lb/> other charges by criminal intimidation, or who abets<lb/> the doing of any of these acts and it would also<lb/> include the successors in interest.<lb/> Section 2(f)<lb/> defines &quot; land grabbing&quot; as Every activity of grabbing<lb/> of any land without any lawful entitlement and with a<lb/> view to illegally take possession of such land or enter<lb/> into or create illegal tenancies or lease and licence<lb/> agreements, would fall within the mischief of land<lb/> grabbing.<lb/> Allowing construction of unauthorised<lb/> structures on such land as defined under Section<lb/> 2(d) or allow use and occupation of such land or<lb/> permit unauthorised structures would also fall within<lb/> the definition of the term &apos;to grab land&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.2 Sections 2(e) and 2(f) are similar to<lb/> Sections 2(d) and 2(e) as defined under Andhra<lb/> Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 (Act<lb/> 12 of 1982). Said provisions of Andhra Pradesh Act,<lb/> 1982 had come up for consideration before Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Apex Court in the matter of KONDA LAKSHMANA<lb/> BAPUJI vs GOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH<lb/> &amp; OTHERS reported in (2002)3 SCC 258 and same<lb/> has been interpreted as:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;30. A perusal of clause (d) shows<lb/> that the expression &quot;land grabber&quot;<lb/> takes in its fold : (1) a person or a<lb/> group of persons who commits<lb/> land grabbing; (2) a person who<lb/> gives financial aid to any person<lb/> for (a) taking illegal possession of<lb/> the lands, or (b) construction of<lb/> unauthorised structures thereon;<lb/></item>

			<item>(3) a person who collects or<lb/> attempts to collect from any<lb/> occupiers of such lands rent,<lb/> compensation and other charges<lb/> by criminal intimidation; (4) a<lb/> person who abets the doing of any<lb/> of the above mentioned acts; and<lb/></item>

			<item>(5) the successors-in-interest of<lb/> such a person. Among these five<lb/> categories, the first category is<lb/> relevant for the present discussion<lb/> --a person or a group of persons<lb/> who commits land grabbing.<lb/></item>

			<item>31. Clause (e) of Section 2,<lb/> quoted<lb/> above,<lb/> defines<lb/> the<lb/> expression &quot;land grabbing&quot; to mean<lb/> : (1) every activity of grabbing of<lb/> any land (whether belonging to the<lb/> Government, a local authority, a<lb/> religious or charitable institution<lb/> or endowment, including a wakf, or<lb/> any other private person) by a<lb/> person or group of persons; (2)<lb/> such grabbing must be : (i) without<lb/> any lawful entitlement and (ii) with<lb/> a view to : (a) illegally taking<lb/> possession of such lands; or (b) to<lb/> enter<lb/> into<lb/> or<lb/> create<lb/> illegal<lb/> tenancies, lease and licences<lb/> agreements or any other illegal<lb/> agreements in respect of such<lb/> lands;<lb/> or<lb/></item>

			<item>(c)<lb/> to<lb/> construct<lb/> unauthorised structures thereon<lb/> for sale or hire; or (d) to give such<lb/> lands to any person on (i) rental or<lb/> (ii) lease and licence basis for<lb/> construction, or (iii) use and<lb/> occupation<lb/> of<lb/> unauthorised<lb/> structures.<lb/></item>

			<item>32. Inasmuch<lb/> as<lb/> the<lb/> aforementioned expressions are<lb/> defined<lb/> employing<lb/> the<lb/> term<lb/> &quot;grabbing&quot;, it is necessary to<lb/> ascertain the import of that term.<lb/> It is not defined in the Act. It is not<lb/> a technical term or a term of art so<lb/> it has to be understood in its<lb/> ordinary common meaning.<lb/></item>

			<p>33. The meaning of the term<lb/> &quot;grab&quot; in the New International<lb/> Webster&apos;s<lb/> Comprehensive<lb/> Dictionary<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> English<lb/> Language, is given as follows :<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;To grasp or seize forcibly or<lb/> suddenly; to take possession of<lb/> violently or dishonestly; to make a<lb/> sudden grasp. See synonyms<lb/> under grasp -(i) The act of<lb/> grabbing, or that which is grabbed.<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) A dishonest or unlawful taking<lb/> possession or acquisition (iii) An<lb/> apparatus for grappling.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>34. In Words and Phrases,<lb/> permanent edition, Vol.18, the<lb/> meaning of &quot;grab&quot; is noted as<lb/> under :<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;The word &quot;grab&quot; means an<lb/> act or practice of appropriating<lb/> unscrupulously, as in politics.<lb/> Smith v. Pure Oil Co., 128 S.W.2d<lb/> 931, 933, 278 Ky.430.<lb/> The word &quot;grab&quot; means a<lb/> seizure or acquisition by violent or<lb/> unscrupulous means. Smith v.<lb/> Pure Oil Co., 128 S.W.2d 931, 933,<lb/> 278 Ky.430.<lb/> The word &quot;grab&quot; means to<lb/> seize, grasp, or snatch forcibly or<lb/> suddenly with the hand, hence to<lb/> take possession of suddenly,<lb/> violently, or dishonestly. Smith v.<lb/> Pure Oil Co., 128 S.W.2d 931, 933,<lb/> 278 Ky.430.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>35. Corpus Juris Secundum,<lb/> Volume 38, records the meaning of<lb/> the term &quot;grab&quot; thus :<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;As a verb, to seize, grasp or<lb/> snatch forcibly or suddenly with<lb/> the hand, hence to take possession<lb/> of<lb/> suddenly,<lb/> violently,<lb/> or<lb/> dishonestly.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>36. In<lb/> Concise<lb/> Oxford<lb/> Dictionary, the following meanings<lb/> of the word &quot;grab&quot; are noted :<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;A seize suddenly; capture,<lb/> arrest; take greedily or unfairly;<lb/> attract the attention of, impress;<lb/> make a sudden snatch at; intr. (of<lb/> the brakes of a motor vehicle) act<lb/> harshly or jerkily. -n. (i) a sudden<lb/> clutch or attempt to seize; (ii)a<lb/> mechanical device for clutching.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>38. A combined reading of<lb/> clauses (d) and (e) would suggest<lb/> that to bring a person within the<lb/> meaning of the expression &quot;land<lb/> grabber&quot; it must be shown that :<lb/></p>

			<item>(i)<lb/></item>

			<item>(a)<lb/> he<lb/> has<lb/> taken<lb/> unauthorisedly,<lb/> unfairly,<lb/> greedily,<lb/> snatched<lb/> forcibly,<lb/> violently or unscrupulously any<lb/> land belonging to government or<lb/> a local authority, a religious or<lb/> charitable<lb/> institution<lb/> or<lb/> endowment, including a wakf, or<lb/> any other private person; (b)<lb/> without any lawful entitlement;<lb/> and (c) with a view to illegally<lb/> taking possession of such lands,<lb/> or enter or create illegal tenancies<lb/> or lease and licences agreements<lb/> or any other illegal agreements in<lb/> respect of such lands or to<lb/> construct<lb/> unauthorised<lb/> structures thereon for sale or<lb/> hire, or give such lands to any<lb/> person on rental or lease and<lb/> licence basis for construction, or<lb/> use<lb/> and<lb/> occupation<lb/> of<lb/> unauthorised structures; or (ii)<lb/> he has given financial aid to any<lb/> person<lb/> for<lb/> taking<lb/> illegal<lb/> possession of lands or for<lb/> construction of unauthorised<lb/> structures thereon; or (iii) he is<lb/> collecting or attempting to collect<lb/> from any occupiers of such lands<lb/> rent, compensation and other<lb/> charges by criminal intimation;<lb/> or (iv) he is abetting the doing of<lb/> any of the above-mentioned acts;<lb/> or (v) that he is the successor-in-<lb/>interest of any such persons.<lb/></item>

			<item>39. It must be borne in mind<lb/> that for purposes of taking<lb/> cognizance of a case under the<lb/> Act existence of an allegation of<lb/> any act of land grabbing is the<lb/> sine qua non and not the truth or<lb/> otherwise of such an allegation.<lb/> But to hold that a person is a<lb/> land grabber it is necessary to<lb/> find<lb/> that<lb/> the<lb/> allegations<lb/> satisfying the requirements of<lb/> land grabbing are proved.<lb/></item>

			<item>40. To make out a case in a<lb/> civil case that the appellant is a<lb/> land grabber the first respondent<lb/> must aver and prove both the<lb/> ingredients --the factum as well<lb/> as the intention --that the<lb/> appellant falls in the categories of<lb/> the persons, mentioned above<lb/> (clause (d) of Section 2 of the Act),<lb/> has occupied the land in dispute,<lb/> which belonged to the first<lb/> respondent, without any lawful<lb/> entitlement and with a view to or<lb/> with the intention of illegally<lb/> taking possession of such land or<lb/> entering into the land for any of<lb/> the purposes mentioned in clause<lb/> (e) of Section 2 of the Act,<lb/> summarised above.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>27.3 Section 3 of KLGP Act-2011 states that<lb/> &apos;land grabbing&apos; in any form is prohibited and is<lb/> declared unlawful and any activity connected with or<lb/> arising out of land grabbing to be an offence, which<lb/> would be punishable under the Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.4 Section 4 of KLGP Act-2011 states that<lb/> land grabbing by any person would be unlawful and<lb/> sub-section (2) of Section 4 would also take within its<lb/> sweep that a person who after commencement of the<lb/> Act, continue to be in occupation of such grabbed<lb/> land otherwise than a lawful tenant to fall within the<lb/> definition of &quot;prohibition of land grabbing&quot;. Sub-<lb/>section (3) of Section 4 provides for punishment with<lb/> imprisonment for a term of not less than one (1) year<lb/> and which may extend upto 3 years and with fine<lb/> upto Rs.25,000/-for contravention of sub-section (1)<lb/> or sub-section (2) of Section 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.5 Section 5 of the KLGP Act-2011<lb/> specifically contemplates for levy of penalty for other<lb/> offences in connection with land grabbing and<lb/> clauses (a) to (e) would indicate that on conviction of<lb/> such person for contravention of the provisions of the<lb/> Act or in connection with any such land grabbing,<lb/> same would be punishable with imprisonment for a<lb/> term which shall not be less than one year but which<lb/> may extend to three years and with fine which may<lb/> extend to Rs.25,000/-.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.6 Section 6 speaks about offences by the<lb/> Companies. Sub-section (1) would indicate that<lb/> where an offence under the Act or Rule made<lb/> thereunder have been committed by the Company,<lb/> every such person who at the time of the offence was<lb/> committed, was incharge of and was responsible to<lb/> the company for the conduct of business of the<lb/> company, as well as the company, would be deemed<lb/> to be guilty of the offence and can be proceeded<lb/> accordingly. However, if such person proves that<lb/> offence was committed without his knowledge or that<lb/> he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the<lb/> commission of such offence, sub-section (1) would<lb/> not be attracted in such circumstances. Sub-section<lb/> (2) would indicate that where any such offence has<lb/> been committed by a company and it has been<lb/> proved that the offence has been committed with<lb/> consent or connivance of or is attributable to any<lb/> neglect on the part of any Director, Manager,<lb/> Secretary or other officer of the company, then such<lb/> person would be deemed to be guilty of that offence<lb/> and shall be proceeded accordingly.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.7 Section 7 of the KLGP Act-2011 is an<lb/> exhaustive section which speaks about the<lb/> constitution of Special Courts not only to enquire<lb/> into alleged act of land grabbing and speedy enquiry<lb/> into any alleged act of land grabbing, trial of cases in<lb/> respect of the ownership and title to or lawful<lb/> possession of the land grabbed but also about<lb/> offences specified in Chapter XIV-A of the Karnataka<lb/> Land Revenue Act, 1964.<lb/> It also enables the<lb/> Government to constitute a Special Court and sub-<lb/>section (2) indicates that it would consist of a<lb/> Chairman and four other members to be appointed<lb/> by the Government. The Chairman shall be a person<lb/> who is or was a Judge of the High Court and out of<lb/> four other members, two persons would be District<lb/> Judges either sitting or retired to act as &quot;Judicial<lb/> Members&quot;; the other two members would be not<lb/> below the rank of Deputy Commissioner of a District.<lb/> A holistic reading of Section 7 would indicate the<lb/> manner in which the Special Courts are to be<lb/> constituted including the additional Benches of the<lb/> Special Court and the composition of Benches, the<lb/> powers of the Chairman, quorum for constitution of<lb/> any Bench and the like matters.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.8 Section 9 speaks about procedure and<lb/> power of the Special Courts. It has eight (8) sub-<lb/>sections. A plain reading of sub-section (1) of Section<lb/> 9 would indicate that Special Court either suo motu<lb/> or on an application can take cognizance of and try<lb/> every case arising out of an alleged act of land<lb/> grabbing or with respect to the ownership and title to,<lb/> or lawful possession of the land grabbed or offences<lb/> specified in Chapter XIV -A of the Karnataka Land<lb/> Grabbing<lb/> Act<lb/> either<lb/> before<lb/> or<lb/> after<lb/> the<lb/> commencement of the Act and pass such orders as it<lb/> deems fit. Sub-section (2) has vested the Special<lb/> Court to take note of the location or the value of the<lb/> land alleged to have been grabbed or the substantial<lb/> nature of the evil involved for the purposes of taking<lb/> cognizance. Pre-amendment sub-section (3) states<lb/> that only the Special Court constituted for the area in<lb/> which the land grabbed situated alone is competent<lb/> to take cognizance in respect of the offence of land<lb/> grabbing or determination of questions of title and<lb/> ownership or lawful possession of any land grabbed<lb/> under this Act and offences specified in Chapter XIV-<lb/>A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964. It<lb/> further mandates that the decision of Special Court<lb/> shall be final. The Special Court also has power to<lb/> reject any case instituted before it, if, in the opinion<lb/> of the Special Court, any application filed before it is<lb/> primafacie frivolous or vexatious.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.9 Sub-section (4) of Section 9 empowers the<lb/> Special Court to determine the order in which the<lb/> civil and criminal liability is to be tried. It also<lb/> enables the said court whether or not to deliver its<lb/> decision or order until both the proceedings are<lb/> completed. It further states the manner in which the<lb/> evidence in either of the proceedings can be admitted<lb/> or rejected. It further provides that a person accused<lb/> of land grabbing or abetment thereof to be a<lb/> competent witness for the defence to disprove the<lb/> charges made against him or any person charged<lb/> with him of the offence of land grabbing in criminal<lb/> proceedings. Proviso thereto enables such person<lb/> alleged of land grabbing not to be called as a witness<lb/> except on his own request in writing and failure to<lb/> give evidence should not be made the subject of any<lb/> comment by any of the parties and it would not give<lb/> rise to any presumptions against himself or any<lb/> person charged together with him at the same<lb/> proceedings.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.10 Sub-section (5)(a) to (c) of Section 9<lb/> mandates that Special Court while deciding the civil<lb/> liability of a person shall follow its own procedure<lb/> which is not inconsistent with the provisions of Code<lb/> of Civil Procedure; to try the offence summarily if<lb/> necessary; and to take possession of such grabbed<lb/> land. Sub-section (6) stipulates the time limit of six<lb/> months within which the case initiated before it<lb/> under sub-section (1) of Section 9 is to be disposed<lb/> of. Plain reading of sub-section (7) of Section 9 would<lb/> indicate that finding recorded by the Special Court<lb/> shall be conclusive proof of the fact of land grabbing<lb/> and the persons who had committed the same and<lb/> the binding effect of said judgment with regard to the<lb/> determination of title and ownership to, or lawful<lb/> possession of any land grabbed shall be binding on<lb/> all persons having interest in such land. The three<lb/> provisos thereto provides for the manner in which<lb/> possession of the land grabbed being taken.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.11 Sub-section (8) of Section 9 enables the<lb/> Special Court to award compensation in terms of<lb/> money for wrongful possession of land grabbed and<lb/> said compensation should not be less than the<lb/> amount equivalent to the market value of the land<lb/> grabbed as on the date of the order along with profits<lb/> accrued from the land payable by the land grabber to<lb/> the owner of the grabbed land and it can direct re-<lb/>delivery of possession to its rightful owner. The<lb/> amount of compensation and profits so awarded and<lb/> costs of re-delivery could be recovered as arrears of<lb/> land revenue in case the Government is the owner.<lb/> Of course, the Special Court has to give an<lb/> opportunity to the land grabber of being heard and to<lb/> make his representation or to adduce evidence if any,<lb/> in this regard and such representation will have to be<lb/> considered before passing an order under sub-section<lb/> (8).<lb/></p>

			<p>27.12 Section 10 states that the Special Court<lb/> has the powers of Civil Court and Court of Sessions<lb/> as it deals with determination of title to the land<lb/> grabbed and also the offence with regard to land<lb/> grabbing. Therefore, the Special Court is deemed to<lb/> be a Civil Court insofar as it relates to determination<lb/> of title and Court of Sessions insofar as it relates to<lb/> offence of land grabbing. The person conducting a<lb/> prosecution before the Special Court is deemed to be<lb/> a Public Prosecutor.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.13 Section 11 speaks about burden of proof.<lb/> If in any proceedings under this Act, prima-facie, it is<lb/> proved to be the land owned by the Government, the<lb/> Special Court would presume that the person who is<lb/> alleged to have grabbed the land is a land grabber<lb/> and the burden of proving that land has not been<lb/> grabbed by him would be on such person.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.14 Section 16 of the KLGP Act-2011 would<lb/> indicate the provisions of the said Act would have<lb/> overriding<lb/> effect,<lb/> not<lb/> withstanding<lb/> anything<lb/> inconsistent contained in any other law which is in<lb/> force or custom, usage or agreement or decree or<lb/> order of a court or any other tribunal or authority.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.15<lb/> Section 17 of the Act enables the<lb/> Special Court to review its judgment or order passed<lb/> under Section 9 to prevent miscarriage of justice.<lb/> However, such review power is not required to be<lb/> exercised or prayer sought for should be entertained,<lb/> except where such order which is sought to be<lb/> reviewed had been passed under mistake of fact,<lb/> ignorance of any material fact or error apparent on<lb/> the face of the record. First proviso thereto enables<lb/> the Special Court to admit or reject review petition by<lb/> circulation even without hearing the petitioner.<lb/> However, where review is to be made, then,<lb/> necessarily the parties affected are required to be<lb/> heard to meet the principles of natural justice.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.16<lb/> Section 20 of the KLGP Act-2011<lb/> speaks that where any proceeding before any court or<lb/> authority, immediately before the constitution of a<lb/> Special Court is pending, same is to be transferred to<lb/> the Special Court and the deeming provision of cause<lb/> of action on which such suit or proceeding is based is<lb/> deemed to have been arisen as if the cause of action<lb/> had arisen before the Special Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>28. When these writ petitions were pending<lb/> before this court for consideration and the arguments<lb/> were being advanced, State brought about<lb/> amendment to the KLGP Act-2011 (Karnataka Act<lb/> 38/2014) by Karnataka Act 30/2020, whereunder<lb/> amendment to Sections 2 and 9 was brought about.<lb/> Sections 10-A, 10-B, 17-A and 22 were inserted.<lb/> Hence, it would be necessary and appropriate to<lb/> analyse these amended provisions also.<lb/></p>

			<p>29. After clause (d) of Section 2, a proviso has<lb/> been inserted whereunder, claims relating to the land<lb/> made by persons which are pending before said<lb/> authorities on the date of commencement of the Act,<lb/> would be excluded from the purview of the Act,<lb/> namely, where applications have been filed under<lb/> Section 94A, 94B, 94C and 94CC of the Karnataka<lb/> Land Revenue Act, 1964 as well as the applications<lb/> filed under Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional<lb/> Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act,<lb/> 2006 are pending, proceedings if already initiated<lb/> before the Special Court, such proceedings stands<lb/> abated.<lb/></p>

			<p>30. Sub-section (3) of Section 9 has been<lb/> substituted by Act 30/2020. A plain reading of the<lb/> amended provision, would indicate that all alleged<lb/> acts of land grabbing should be tried by the Special<lb/> Court constituted for the area in which the land is<lb/> situated or where there are more than one Special<lb/> Courts than one for such area, by such one of them<lb/> as may be specified in that behalf. Proviso which was<lb/> existing prior to Act 30 of 2014 has been deleted.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. Under the Principal Act i.e, KLGP Act-<lb/>2011, the offence punishable under the Act was<lb/> required to be tried summarily. However, under the<lb/> amended Act namely, clause (b) of sub-section (5) of<lb/> Section 9 having been substituted, it has now<lb/> empowered the Special Court to try an offence under<lb/> the Act in a summary manner only if it thinks fit.<lb/> First proviso thereunder would indicate that offence<lb/> under the Act can also be tried as a warrant case if in<lb/> the opinion of the Special Court it requires to be tried<lb/> as a warrant case.<lb/> Two provisos have been<lb/> incorporated to clause (b) by Act 30 of 2020 and<lb/> same would clearly indicate that the Special Court is<lb/> empowered to dismiss the complaint or drop further<lb/> proceedings by recording the reasons in brief, in the<lb/> event Special Court forming an opinion that there are<lb/> no sufficient grounds to proceed further. Whereas,<lb/> second proviso would indicate that Special Court is<lb/> empowered to adopt the procedure adopted for a trial<lb/> of a warrant case for the offence under the Act and<lb/> the Special Court is empowered to recall any witness<lb/> who have been examined.<lb/></p>

			<p>32. A perusal of Sections 10-A and 10-B<lb/> which have been incorporated would indicate that<lb/> jurisdiction of civil court is barred to try a suit or<lb/> other legal proceedings relating to any Government<lb/> land and which is required to be determined by the<lb/> Special Court under the KLGP Act, 2011.<lb/> Section<lb/> 10-B mandates the proceedings initiated under the<lb/> Act is to be completed within six months and give its<lb/> decision in writing to each of the parties to the<lb/> dispute.<lb/></p>

			<p>33. Section 17-A(1) which has been newly<lb/> incorporated would provide for an appeal to be filed<lb/> against any order passed by the Special Court<lb/> determining the civil liability of the parties and the<lb/> High Court would be empowered to entertain such<lb/> appeal on being satisfied that the case involves the<lb/> substantial question of law. The proviso thereto<lb/> stipulates the time limit for filing an appeal as well as<lb/> power to condone the delay by the appellate court for<lb/> sufficient cause, where the appeal is filed beyond the<lb/> period of 30 days. Sub-section (2) of Section 17-A<lb/> enables the aggrieved person to file an appeal against<lb/> an order of acquittal or conviction as the case may<lb/> be. It also provides for the powers to be exercised by<lb/> the High Court would be the powers conferred by<lb/> Chapter XXIX and XXX of Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1903.<lb/></p>

			<p>34. By amendment Act 30/2020, Section 22-A<lb/> has been incorporated, by which applications filed<lb/> under Sections 94A, 94B, 94C and 94CC of the<lb/> Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 are pending on<lb/> the date of the commencement of the Act would stand<lb/> abated.<lb/></p>

			<p>35. Though a valiant attempt has been made<lb/> by some of the learned Advocates appearing for the<lb/> petitioners to contend that State lack legislative<lb/> competence to enact the impugned Act, we are of the<lb/> considered view that said contention ought to fail for<lb/> the simple reason that<lb/> State Legislature is<lb/> empowered to enact the impugned legislation in view<lb/> of Entry 18 and 64 of List-II of the VII Schedule of<lb/> Constitution of India, which clearly empowers the<lb/> State to enact laws with respect to any of the matters<lb/> found in the said list. Entry 64 and also Entry 18<lb/> enables the State to bring in legislation relating to<lb/> land. It would be useful to refer to the judgment of<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the matter of STATE OF A.P<lb/> AND OTHERS vs K MOHANLAL AND ANOTHER<lb/> reported in (1998)5 SCC 468 whereunder Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Apex Court has affirmed the judgment of High Court<lb/> of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh reported in (1997)4<lb/> ALT 220 (DB) which had upheld the constitutional<lb/> validity of Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing<lb/> (Prohibition) Act, 1982. It has been held by the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Apex Court as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;7.<lb/> Article<lb/> 323-B<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> Constitution of India provides that the<lb/> appropriate legislature may, by law,<lb/> provide for the adjudication or trial by<lb/> tribunal any dispute, complaint or<lb/> offences in respect to all or any of the<lb/> matters specified in clause(2) with<lb/> respect to which such legislature has a<lb/> power to make the laws. Clause (2)(d)<lb/> refers, interalia to any rights in land or<lb/> the extinguishment or modification of<lb/> any such rights. The Andhra Pradesh<lb/> High Court has, therefore rightly held<lb/> that the Act which sets up a Special<lb/> Court for land grabbing cases, is within<lb/> the legislative competence of the State<lb/> Government.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>Hence, we do not propose to further delve upon<lb/> said issue and the faint attempt made to contend<lb/> that the KLGP Act-2011 is liable to be struck<lb/> down on the ground of legislative competence<lb/> would fail and all contentions raised in that<lb/> regard stands rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>36. In the light of rival contentions raised, we<lb/> deem it proper to deal with the above contentions by<lb/> delving upon the above aspects in seriatim.<lb/></p>

			<p>(1) RE: RETROSPECTIVE OPERATION:<lb/></p>

			<p>37. It has been contended that even if land<lb/> grabbing is deemed to be a continuing offence, and<lb/> on the date of purchase of land by a bonafide<lb/> purchasers, the KLGP Act-2011 being non-existent, it<lb/> is only the relevant law which was in force which<lb/> would be applicable. It is also contended that if the<lb/> Government sits in acquiescence and thereafter post<lb/> KLGP Act-2011 initiates action, such action acquires<lb/> the character of retrospective operation and therefore<lb/> such act cannot be said to be a continuing offence as<lb/> the State had acquiesced to the fact at the time of<lb/> commission of the alleged offence when the impugned<lb/> legislation was not in existence.<lb/></p>

			<p>38. What is prohibited under Article 20 of the<lb/> Constitution of India is conviction of a person or his<lb/> subjection to a penalty under &apos;ex post facto&apos; laws.<lb/> The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in RAO SHIV BAHADUR<lb/> SINGH &amp; ANOTHER vs THE STATE OF VINDHYA<lb/> PRADESH reported in AIR 1953 SC 394 has held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;9. In this context it is<lb/> necessary to notice that what is<lb/> prohibited under Article 20 is only<lb/> conviction or sentence under an ex<lb/> post facto law and not the trial<lb/> thereof. Such trial under a<lb/> procedure different from what<lb/> obtained at the time of the<lb/> commission of the offence or by a<lb/> court different from that which had<lb/> competence at the time cannot ipso<lb/> facto<lb/> be<lb/> held<lb/> to<lb/> be<lb/> unconstitutional. A person accused<lb/> of the commission of an offence has<lb/> no fundamental right to trial by a<lb/> particular court or by a particular<lb/> procedure, except in so far as any<lb/> constitutional objection by way of<lb/> discrimination or the violation of<lb/> any other fundamental right may<lb/> be involved.<lb/></item>

			<item>10. In this connection our<lb/> attention has been drawn to the<lb/> fact that the Vindhya Pradesh<lb/> Ordinance 48 of 1949, though<lb/> enacted on 11th September, 1949<lb/> i.e., after the alleged offences were<lb/> committed, was in terms made<lb/> retrospective by Section 2 of the<lb/> said Ordinance which says that the<lb/> Act &quot; shall be deemed to have been<lb/> in force in Vindhya Pradesh from<lb/> the 9th day of August, 1948&quot; a date<lb/> long prior to the date of the<lb/> commission of the offences. It was<lb/> accordingly suggested that since<lb/> such a law at the time when it was<lb/> passed was a valid law and since<lb/> this law had the effect of bringing<lb/> this Ordinance into force from 9th<lb/> August, 1949, it cannot be said<lb/> that the convictions are not in<lb/> respect of &quot;a law in force&quot; at the<lb/> time when the offences were<lb/> committed. This, however, would be<lb/> to, import a somewhat technical<lb/> meaning into the phrase &quot;law in<lb/> force&quot; as used in Article 20. &quot; Law<lb/> in force&quot; referred to therein must be<lb/> taken to relate not to a law<lb/> &quot;deemed&quot; to be in force and thus<lb/> brought into force but the law<lb/> factually in operation at the time or<lb/> what may be called the then<lb/> existing law. Otherwise, it is clear<lb/> that the whole purpose of Article<lb/> 20 would be completely defeated in<lb/> its application even to ex post facto<lb/> laws passed after the Constitution.<lb/> Every such ex post facto law can be<lb/> made retrospective, as it must be, if<lb/> it is to regulate acts committed<lb/> before the actual passing of the Act,<lb/> and it can well be urged that by<lb/> such retrospective operation it<lb/> becomes the law in force at the<lb/> time of the commencement of the<lb/> Act. It is obvious that such a<lb/> construction which nullifies Article<lb/> 20 cannot possibly be adopted. It<lb/> cannot therefore be doubted that<lb/> the phrase &quot;law in force&quot; as used<lb/> in Article 20 must be understood in<lb/> its natural sense as being the law<lb/> in fact in existence and in operation<lb/> at the time of the commission of the<lb/> offence as distinct from the law<lb/> &quot;deemed&quot; to have become operative<lb/> by virtue of the power of legislature<lb/> to pass retrospective laws. It follows<lb/> that if the appellants are able to<lb/> substantiate their contention that<lb/> the acts charged as offences in this<lb/> case have become such only by<lb/> virtue of Ordinance No. 48 of 1949<lb/> which has admittedly been passed<lb/> subsequent to the commission<lb/> thereof, then they would be entitled<lb/> to the benefit of Article 20 of the<lb/> Constitution and to have their<lb/> convictions set aside. This leads to<lb/> an examination of the relevant pre-<lb/>existing law.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>39. A new offence cannot be created with<lb/> retrospective effect. It has been held by Hon&apos;ble Apex<lb/> Court<lb/> in<lb/> G.P.NAYYAR<lb/> vs<lb/> STATE<lb/> (DELHI<lb/> ADMINISTRATION) reported in AIR 1979 SC 602 to<lb/> the following effect:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;7.<lb/> Mr. R. K. Garg the learned<lb/> counsel submitted that the provisions<lb/> of Act 16 of 1967 by virtue of which<lb/> the rule of evidence enacted in section<lb/> 5(3) is deemed to have always been in<lb/> existence is violative of Art. 20(1) of<lb/> the Constitution. Article 20(1) of the<lb/> Constitution is as follows:-<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;No<lb/> person<lb/> shall<lb/> be<lb/> convicted of any offence<lb/> except for violation of a law<lb/> in force at the time of the<lb/> commission of the act<lb/> charged as an offence, nor<lb/> be subjected to a penalty<lb/> greater than that which<lb/> might have been inflicted<lb/> under the law in force at<lb/> the time of the commission<lb/> of the offence.&quot;<lb/> Article 20(1) deals with ex post facto<lb/> laws though that expression has not<lb/> been used in the Article. Usually, a<lb/> law prescribes a rule of conduct by<lb/> which persons ought to be governed<lb/> in respect of their civil rights. Certain<lb/> penalties are also imposed under the<lb/> criminal law for breach of any law.<lb/></item>

			<item>Though a sovereign legislature has<lb/> power to legislate retrospectively<lb/> creation of an offence for an act which<lb/> at the time of its commission was not<lb/> an offence or imposition of a penalty<lb/> greater than that which was under the<lb/> law provided violates Art. 20(1). In the<lb/> well known case of Phillips v. Eyre<lb/> (1870) 6 QBD 1 at pp.23 and 25 and<lb/> also in the American case of Calder v.<lb/> Bull (1780 to 1806) 3. Dall 386:1 L ed<lb/> 648 at p.649 the principle underlying<lb/> the<lb/> provision<lb/> has<lb/> been<lb/> fully<lb/> discussed. All that Art. 20(1) prohibits<lb/> is ex post facto laws and is designed<lb/> to prevent a person being punished<lb/> for an act or omission which was<lb/> considered innocent when done. It<lb/> only prohibits the conviction of a<lb/> person or his being subjected to a<lb/> penalty under ex post facto laws. In<lb/> Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh &amp; Anr. v. The<lb/> State of Vindhya Pradesh, 1953 SCR<lb/> 1188: (AIR 1953 SC 394) the Court<lb/> pointed out that &quot;what is prohibited<lb/> under Art. 20(1) is only conviction or<lb/> sentence under an ex post facto law<lb/> and not the trial thereof. Such trial<lb/> under a procedure different from what<lb/> obtained<lb/> at<lb/> the<lb/> time<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> commission of the offence or by a<lb/> Court different from that which had<lb/> competence at the time cannot ipso<lb/> facto be held to be unconstitutional. A<lb/> person accused of the commission of<lb/> an offence has no fundamental right<lb/> to trial by a particular Court or by a<lb/> particular procedure, except in so far<lb/> as any constitutional objection by way<lb/> of discrimination or the violation of<lb/> any other fundamental right may be<lb/> involved.&quot; Thus the appellant cannot<lb/> object to a procedure different from<lb/> what obtained at the time of the<lb/> commission of the offence. The offence<lb/> that was committed was when section<lb/> 5(3) was in force and by Act 16 of<lb/> 1967 the procedure is revived. It is<lb/> not as if the procedure is brought into<lb/> force for the first time. &quot;Where an Act<lb/> is<lb/> repealed<lb/> and<lb/> the<lb/> repealing<lb/> enactment is then repealed by<lb/> another, which manifests no intention<lb/> that the original Act shall continue<lb/> repealed, the common law rule was<lb/> that the repeal of the second Act<lb/> revived the first ab initio.&quot; (Maxwell on<lb/> the Interpretation of Statutes, 12th<lb/> Ed., p.19). There can be no objection<lb/> in law to the revival of the procedure<lb/> which was in force at the time when<lb/> the offence was committed. The effect<lb/> of the amendment is that sub-section<lb/> (3) of section 5 as it stood before the<lb/> commencement of 1964 Act shall<lb/> apply and shall be deemed to have<lb/> always applied in relation to trial of<lb/> offences. It may be if by this deeming<lb/> provision a new offence was created<lb/> then the prohibition under Article<lb/> 20(1) may come into operation. But in<lb/> this case, as already pointed out,<lb/> what is done is no more than<lb/> reiterating the effect of section 6(1) of<lb/> the General Clauses Act. Mr. Garg,<lb/> the learned counsel, submitted that<lb/> by amending procedure drastically<lb/> and giving it retrospective effect a new<lb/> offence may be created retrospectively.<lb/> It was contended that by shifting the<lb/> burden of proof as provided for<lb/> in section 5(3) of the Prevention of<lb/> Corruption Act, 1947, a new offence is<lb/> created. It is unnecessary for us to<lb/> consider the larger question as to<lb/> whether in certain circumstances<lb/> giving retrospective effect to the<lb/> procedure may amount to creation of<lb/> an offence retrospectively. In the<lb/> present case the old procedure is<lb/> revived and no new procedure is given<lb/> retrospective effect. The procedure<lb/> given effect to is not of such a nature<lb/> as to result in creation of a new<lb/> offence.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>40. In this background, it would be<lb/> appropriate to notice the definition of a &quot;land<lb/> grabber&quot; as defined under Section 2(e).<lb/> A land<lb/> grabber would be a person or group of persons or a<lb/> society, who commits or has committed land<lb/> grabbing and includes any person who gives financial<lb/> aid to any person for taking illegal possession of<lb/> lands or for construction of unauthorised structures<lb/> thereon, or who collects or who attempts to collect<lb/> from any occupier of such lands rent, compensation<lb/> and other charges by criminal intimidation, or who<lb/> abets the doing of any of the above mentioned acts<lb/> and also includes successors in interest. Section 4(1)<lb/> prohibits person from committing or cause to be<lb/> committed land grabbing by himself or through any<lb/> other person and sub-section (2) would indicate who<lb/> on or after the commencement of this Act continued<lb/> to be in occupation, otherwise than as a lawful<lb/> tenant, of a grabbed land belonging to the<lb/> Government and other authorities as specified<lb/> thereunder would be guilty of the offence under the<lb/> Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>41. It requires to be noticed that for Section 3,<lb/> 4 and 5 being attracted, there should be the act of<lb/> &quot;land grabbing&quot; by a &quot;land grabber.&quot; To fall within<lb/> the definition of Section 2(e) -&quot;land grabber&quot; as<lb/> already noticed hereinabove the person/s defined<lb/> thereunder ought to have committed the land<lb/> grabbing<lb/> and<lb/> any<lb/> person<lb/> who<lb/> after<lb/> the<lb/> commencement of the Act continues to be in<lb/> occupation of the grabbed land, would be liable to be<lb/> punished. In other words, if a person is able to<lb/> demonstrate or establish that the land in his<lb/> occupation is not a land belonging to the<lb/> Government, WAKF or Hindu Religious and<lb/> Charitable Endowments, a local authority, a<lb/> statutory or non-statutory body owned, controlled or<lb/> managed by the Government, such person would be<lb/> outside the purview of the Act. The definition clause<lb/> of &apos;land grabber&apos; also takes within its fold the<lb/> successors in interest. Thus, when an offence of land<lb/> grabbing has continued as on the date of the<lb/> commencement of the KLGP Act-2011, it would<lb/> clearly part-take the character of a continuing<lb/> offence.<lb/></p>

			<p>42. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the cae of<lb/> STATE OF BIHAR vs. DEOKARAN NENSHI reported<lb/> in (1972) 2 SCC 890 has held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;5.<lb/> A continuing offence is one<lb/> which is susceptible of continuance<lb/> and is distinguishable from the one<lb/> which is committed once and for<lb/> all. It is one of those offences which<lb/> arises out of a failure to obey or<lb/> comply with a rule or its<lb/> requirement and which involves a<lb/> penalty, the liability for which<lb/> continues until the rule or its<lb/> requirement is obeyed or complied<lb/> with. On every occasion that such<lb/> disobedience or non-compliance,<lb/> occurs and recurs, there is the<lb/> offence committed. The distinction<lb/> between the two kinds of offences<lb/> is between an act or omission<lb/> which constitutes an offence once<lb/> and for all and an act or omission<lb/> which continues and therefore<lb/> constitutes a fresh offence every<lb/> time or occasion on which it<lb/> continues. In the case of a<lb/> continuing offence, there is thus<lb/> the ingredient of continuance of<lb/> the offence which is absent in the<lb/> case of an offence which takes<lb/> place when an act or omission is<lb/> committed once and for all.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>43. In the matter of MOHANLAL vs STATE<lb/> OF RAJASTHAN reported in (2015)6 SCC 222<lb/> contention came to be raised by the accused who was<lb/> tried for the offence punishable under Narcotic Drugs<lb/> and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 contending<lb/> that as per the case of the prosecution the incident of<lb/> theft had occurred between 12.11.1985/13.11.1985<lb/> and an FIR came to be lodged for an offence under<lb/> Section 457 IPC and during preparation of an<lb/> inventory, it was found that 10 kg 420 grams of<lb/> Opium and some other articles which had been<lb/> stolen from the court premises was stored in several<lb/> packets. The appellant (Mohan Lal) was charge<lb/> sheeted for the offence under Section 18 of NDPS Act<lb/> and Section 457 and 380 IPC after investigation,<lb/> since he had lead to the recovery of stolen Opium<lb/> from the court premises. A plea was raised that<lb/> NDPS Act came into force on 14.11.1985 and the<lb/> offence was punishable under the Opium Act, 1878<lb/> and the alleged recovery was made on 16.11.1985<lb/> while the appellant was in custody. Hence, it was<lb/> contended that on the date of the incident i.e.,<lb/> 12.11.1985/13.11.1985 the NDPS Act was not in<lb/> force and it had come into force only on 14.11.1985.<lb/> Repelling or rejecting the said contention, it came to<lb/> be held that the appellant had the requisite degree of<lb/> control of the prohibited narcotic substance. It also<lb/> came to be held that appellant-accused was in<lb/> possession of the prohibited or contraband<lb/> substance, which was an offence when NDPS Act<lb/> came into force. It has been further held that Article<lb/> 20(1) of the Constitution of India would have no<lb/> application and the actus of possession is not<lb/> punishable with retrospective effect. It is further<lb/> held that no offence was created under Section 18 of<lb/> the NDPS Act with retrospective effect. What is<lb/> punishable is possession of the prohibited article on<lb/> or after a particular date when the statute was<lb/> enacted, creating the offence or enhancing the<lb/> punishment. It has been further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;22.<lb/> In the case at hand, the<lb/> appellant, we hold, had the requisite<lb/> degree of control when, even if the<lb/> said narcotic substance was not<lb/> within his physical control at that<lb/> moment. To give an example, a person<lb/> can conceal prohibited<lb/> narcotic<lb/> substance in a property and move out<lb/> thereafter. The said person because of<lb/> necessary animus would be in<lb/> possession of the said substance even<lb/> if he is not, at the moment, in<lb/> physical control. The situation cannot<lb/> be viewed differently when a person<lb/> conceals and hides the prohibited<lb/> narcotic substance in a public space.<lb/> In the second category of cases, the<lb/> person would be in possession<lb/> because he has the necessary animus<lb/> and the intention to retain control and<lb/> dominion. As the factual matrix would<lb/> exposit, the accused-appellant was in<lb/> possession of the prohibited or<lb/> contraband substance which was an<lb/> offence when the NDPS Act came into<lb/> force.<lb/> Hence,<lb/> he<lb/> remained<lb/> in<lb/> possession<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> prohibited<lb/> substance and as such offence<lb/> under Section 18 of the NDPS Act is<lb/> made out. The possessory right would<lb/> continue unless there is something to<lb/> show that he had been divested of it.<lb/> On the contrary, as we find, he led to<lb/> discovery of the substance which was<lb/> within his special knowledge, and,<lb/> therefore, there can be no scintilla of<lb/> doubt that he was in possession of the<lb/> contraband article when the NDPS<lb/> Act came into force. To clarify the<lb/> situation, we may give an example. A<lb/> person had stored 100 bags of opium<lb/> prior to the NDPS Act coming into<lb/> force and after coming into force, the<lb/> recovery of the possessed article takes<lb/> place. Certainly, on the date of<lb/> recovery, he is in possession of the<lb/> contraband article and possession<lb/> itself is an offence. In such a<lb/> situation,<lb/> the<lb/> accused-appellant<lb/> cannot take the plea that he had<lb/> committed an offence under Section<lb/> 9 of the Opium Act and not<lb/> under Section 18 of the NDPS Act.<lb/></item>

			<item>23. After dealing with the concept of<lb/> possession, we think it apt to address<lb/> the issue raised by the learned<lb/> counsel for the appellant that he<lb/> could have convicted and sentenced<lb/> under the Opium Act, as that was the<lb/> law in force at the time of commission<lb/> of an offence and if he is convicted<lb/> under Section 18 of the NDPS Act, it<lb/> would tantamount to retrospective<lb/> operation of law imposing penalty<lb/> which is prohibited under Article<lb/> 20(1) of<lb/> the<lb/> Constitution<lb/> of<lb/> India. Article 20(1) gets attracted only<lb/> when any penal law penalises with<lb/> retrospective effect i.e. when an act<lb/> was not an offence when it was<lb/> committed<lb/> and<lb/> additionally<lb/> the<lb/> persons cannot be subjected to<lb/> penalty greater than that which might<lb/> have been inflicted under the law in<lb/> force at the time of commission of the<lb/> offence.<lb/> The<lb/> Article<lb/> prohibits<lb/> application of ex post facto law. In Rao<lb/> Shiv Bahadur Singh and Anr. v. State<lb/> of Vindhya Pradesh[23], while dealing<lb/> with the import under Article 20(1) of<lb/> the Constitution of India, the Court<lb/> stated what has been prohibited<lb/> under the said Article is the<lb/> conviction and sentence in a criminal<lb/> proceeding under ex post facto law<lb/> and not the trial thereof. The<lb/> Constitution Bench has held that:<lb/> (AIR p.398, para 9)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;9.<lb/> ....what<lb/> is<lb/> prohibited<lb/> under Article<lb/> 20 is<lb/> only<lb/> conviction or sentence under an<lb/> &apos;ex post facto&apos; law and not the<lb/> trial thereof. Such trial under a<lb/> procedure different from what<lb/> obtained at the time of the<lb/> commission of the offence or by<lb/> a Court different from that<lb/> which had competence at the<lb/> time cannot &apos;ipso facto&apos; be held<lb/> to be unconstitutional. A person<lb/> accused of the commission of a<lb/> particular Court or by a<lb/> particular procedure, except in<lb/> so far as any constitutional<lb/> objection<lb/> by<lb/> way<lb/> of<lb/> discrimination or the violation of<lb/> any other fundamental right<lb/> may be involved.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>24.<lb/> In the instant case, Article<lb/> 20(1) would have no application. The<lb/> actus of possession is not punishable<lb/> with retrospective affect. No offence is<lb/> created under Section 18 of the NDPS<lb/> Act with retrospective effect. What is<lb/> punishable is possession of the<lb/> prohibited article on or after a<lb/> particular date when the statute was<lb/> enacted, creating the offence or<lb/> enhancing the punishment. Therefore,<lb/> if a person is in possession of the<lb/> banned substance on the date when<lb/> the NDPS Act was enforced, he would<lb/> commit the offence, for on the said<lb/> date he would have both the &apos;corpus&apos;<lb/> and &apos;animus&apos; necessary in law.<lb/></p>

			<p>25. We would be failing in our duty, if<lb/> we do not analyse the decision in<lb/> Harjit Singh (supra). In the said case<lb/> the Court was dealing with the<lb/> Notification dated 18.11.2009 that<lb/> has replaced the part of the<lb/> Notification dated 19.10.2001. Dealing<lb/> with the said aspect, the Court held:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;13. Notification dated 18-11-2009<lb/> has replaced the part of the<lb/> Notification dated 19-10-2001 and<lb/> reads as under:<lb/> &apos;In the Table at the end<lb/> after Note 3, the following Note<lb/> shall be inserted, namely:<lb/></item>

			<item>(4) The quantities shown<lb/> in Column 5 and Column 6 of<lb/> the Table relating to the<lb/> respective drugs shown in<lb/> Column 2 shall apply to the<lb/> entire mixture or any solution or<lb/> any one or more narcotic drugs<lb/> or psychotropic substances of<lb/> that particular drug in dosage<lb/> form or isomers, esters, ethers<lb/> and salts of these drugs,<lb/> including salts of esters, ethers<lb/> and isomers, wherever existence<lb/> of such substance is possible<lb/> and not just its pure drug<lb/> content.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>14. Thus, it is evident that<lb/> under the aforesaid notification,<lb/> the whole quantity of material<lb/> recovered in the form of mixture is<lb/> to be considered for the purpose of<lb/> imposition<lb/> of<lb/> punishment.<lb/> However, the submission is not<lb/> acceptable as it is a settled legal<lb/> proposition that a penal provision<lb/> providing<lb/> for<lb/> enhancing<lb/> the<lb/> sentence<lb/> does<lb/> not<lb/> operate<lb/> retrospectively. This amendment,<lb/> in fact, provides for a procedure<lb/> which may enhance the sentence.<lb/> Thus, its application would be<lb/> violative of restrictions imposed<lb/> by Article 20 of the Constitution of<lb/> India. We are of the view that the<lb/> said Notification dated 18-11-2009<lb/> cannot be applied retrospectively<lb/> and therefore, has no application<lb/> so far as the instant case is<lb/> concerned.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The present fact situation is<lb/> absolutely different and, therefore,<lb/> the said decision has no applicability<lb/> to the case at hand.<lb/></p>

			<p>26. Learned counsel for the State<lb/> has contended that the offence in<lb/> question is a continuing offence, for<lb/> the offence is basically a possession<lb/> of the contraband articles. He has<lb/> commended us to the authority<lb/> in State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi<lb/> &amp; Anr.[24], wherein it has been held<lb/> that:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;5. A continuing offence is<lb/> one which is susceptible of<lb/> continuance<lb/> and<lb/> is<lb/> distinguishable from the one<lb/> which is committed once and<lb/> for all. It is one of those<lb/> offences which arises out of<lb/> a failure to obey or comply<lb/> with<lb/> a<lb/> rule<lb/> or<lb/> its<lb/> requirement<lb/> and<lb/> which<lb/> involves a penalty, the<lb/> liability for which continues<lb/> until<lb/> the<lb/> rule<lb/> or<lb/> its<lb/> requirement is obeyed or<lb/> complied with. On every<lb/> occasion<lb/> that<lb/> such<lb/> disobedience<lb/> or<lb/> non-<lb/>compliance<lb/> occurs<lb/> and<lb/> reoccurs, there is the offence<lb/> committed. The distinction<lb/> between the two kinds of<lb/> offences is between an act or<lb/> omission which constitutes<lb/> an offence once and for all<lb/> and an act or omission<lb/> which<lb/> continues,<lb/> and<lb/> therefore, constitutes a fresh<lb/> offence<lb/> every<lb/> time<lb/> or<lb/> occasion<lb/> on<lb/> which<lb/> it<lb/> continues. In the case of a<lb/> continuing offence, there is<lb/> thus<lb/> the<lb/> ingredient<lb/> of<lb/> continuance of the offence<lb/> which is absent in the case<lb/> of an offence which takes<lb/> place when an act or<lb/> omission is committed once<lb/> and for all.&quot;&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>44. Even in the instant case it can be clearly<lb/> noticed that it is not only the act of &quot;land grabbing&quot;<lb/> by a &quot;land grabber&quot; would be punishable under<lb/> Section 5 but also a person who after the<lb/> commencement of the Act continues to be in<lb/> occupation of a grabbed land belonging to the<lb/> authorities specified under Section 2(d) would be<lb/> punishable under Section 5 inasmuch as, the actus<lb/> of possession of the land grabbed continues on the<lb/> date of commencement of the KLGP Act-2011. That<lb/> apart, the act of land grabbing is punishable under<lb/> the Land Revenue Act and the provisions of the KLGP<lb/> Act-2011<lb/> having<lb/> an<lb/> overriding<lb/> effect,<lb/> notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith<lb/> contained in any other law for the time being in force<lb/> or custom, usage or agreement or decree or order of a<lb/> court or any other tribunal or authority, the<lb/> provisions of KLGP Act-2011 as amended from time-<lb/>to-time would prevail and the offence of land<lb/> grabbing committed would continue. In other words,<lb/> the act of land grabbing has been specified under the<lb/> Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 as an offence.<lb/> Thus, irresistible conclusion which has to be drawn<lb/> is that the offence of land grabbing is an offence<lb/> which is continuous in nature or in other words, a<lb/> continuing offence. In that view of the matter, we are<lb/> not inclined to accept the contention raised by the<lb/> learned Advocates appearing for the petitioners that<lb/> it would be violative of Article 20 of the Constitution<lb/> of India. It cannot be gainsaid by the petitioners that<lb/> even in respect of an offence under Section 4(1) being<lb/> distinct would attract Article 20(1) of the Constitution<lb/> of India or in other words, the offence under KLGP<lb/> Act-2011 is made retrospective in operation. Said<lb/> argument is fallacious, inasmuch as, the language<lb/> employed in sub-section (1) of Section 4 is in<lb/> presenti. In other words, it would indicate that no<lb/> person should commit or cause to be committed land<lb/> grabbing by himself or through any other person and<lb/> having committed, if continues with the possession of<lb/> the grabbed land or if it is sold or possession is<lb/> parted with, the successors in interest would also be<lb/> liable. The language found in sub-section (1) of<lb/> Section 4 is clear and unambiguous namely, if a<lb/> person were to commit the act of land grabbing or<lb/> causes to be committed through any other person,<lb/> which is prohibited would be liable to penal<lb/> consequences specified thereunder. Hence, it cannot<lb/> be contended that Section 4(1) would be retrospective<lb/> in operation.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2) RE: ARBITRARINESS IN THE ENACTMENT:<lb/></p>

			<p>45. The sum and substance of the arguments<lb/> canvassed on behalf of the petitioners is that<lb/> sequencing of procedure under Section 9 is arbitrary<lb/> and discriminatory and as such Section 9 of KLGP<lb/> Act-2011 is to be struck down and consequently<lb/> entire Act is to be struck down as it is violative of<lb/> Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. It is<lb/> submitted that there is abdication of power by the<lb/> State to make an application and that too, without<lb/> any limitation, complaint can be made before the<lb/> Special Court alleging land grabbing and therefore,<lb/> Section 9(1) is liable to be struck down. It is further<lb/> contended that under Section 9(1) r/w Section 9(2)<lb/> and 9(3) there is no statutory responsibility to pass a<lb/> reasoned prima facie order before taking cognizance<lb/> and this affects the right of a party immensely. It is<lb/> also contended that Section 20 dealing with transfer<lb/> does not require any speaking order to be passed and<lb/> as such Section 20 requires to be struck down.<lb/></p>

			<p>46. It is also contended that there is no<lb/> definition of the expression &quot;an arrear of land<lb/> revenue&quot; recoverable under Section 9(8) and thereby<lb/> it implies that recourse has to be taken to the<lb/> definition found under Section 60(b) of the Karnataka<lb/> Land Revenue Act and thereby it implies that the<lb/> person becomes a legal owner of the land and thereby<lb/> by creation of a statute, a person cannot be<lb/> presumed to be the owner of land on the one hand for<lb/> purposes of land revenue and as a criminal or land<lb/> grabber on the other hand.<lb/></p>

			<p>47. It is well settled principle of law there is a<lb/> presumption in favour of constitutionality of a<lb/> statute. While deciding the validity of a statute, it<lb/> would be the endeavour of the court to find out the<lb/> intention of the legislature, which gave rise to the<lb/> birth of enactment under challenge and the purpose<lb/> which is sought to be achieved through the<lb/> enactment or in other words the mischief which is<lb/> sought to be remedied. However, any law made by<lb/> the legislature can be struck down on three (3)<lb/> grounds i.e., (a) lack of legislative competence; (b)<lb/> violation of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed<lb/> under the Constitution or any other constitutional<lb/> provision; and (c) arbitrariness. The Hon&apos;ble Apex<lb/> Court in the case of SHREYA SINGHAL vs. UNION<lb/> OF INDIA supra has held that the statutory provision<lb/> can be invalidated on the ground of vagueness too.<lb/></p>

			<p>48. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the case of<lb/> STATE OF BIHAR vs. BIHAR DISTILLERY LTD.<lb/> supra has held that the courts should strike down an<lb/> enactment only when it is not possible to sustain it.<lb/></p>

			<p>49. Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in SHAYARA BANO<lb/> vs UNION OF INDIA reported in (2017)9 SCC 1 has<lb/> held that doctrine of arbitrariness which follows from<lb/> rule of law contained in Article 14 is of significance<lb/> in its application to State&apos;s action. It has been<lb/> further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;67. We now come to the<lb/> development of the doctrine of<lb/> arbitrariness and its application to<lb/> State action as a distinct doctrine on<lb/> which State action may be struck<lb/> down as being violative of the rule of<lb/> law contained in Article 14. In a<lb/> significant passage, Bhagwati, J.,<lb/> in E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N.,<lb/> (1974) 4 SCC 3 stated (at page 38):<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;85. The last two grounds of<lb/> challenge may be taken up<lb/> together<lb/> for<lb/> consideration.<lb/> Though we have formulated<lb/> the third ground of challenge<lb/> as a distinct and separate<lb/> ground,<lb/> it<lb/> is<lb/> really<lb/> in<lb/> substance and effect merely an<lb/> aspect of the second ground<lb/> based on violation of Articles<lb/> 14<lb/> and<lb/> 16.<lb/> Article<lb/> 16 embodies the fundamental<lb/> guarantee that there shall be<lb/> equality of opportunity for all<lb/> citizens in matters relating to<lb/> employment or appointment to<lb/> any office under the State.<lb/> Though enacted as a distinct<lb/> and independent fundamental<lb/> right because of its great<lb/> importance as a principle<lb/> ensuring<lb/> equality<lb/> of<lb/> opportunity<lb/> in<lb/> public<lb/> employment which is so vital<lb/> to the building up of the new<lb/> classless egalitarian society<lb/> envisaged<lb/> in<lb/> the<lb/> Constitution, Article 16 is only<lb/> an instance of the application<lb/> of the concept of equality<lb/> enshrined<lb/> in Article<lb/></item>

			<item>14. In<lb/> other words, Article 14 is the<lb/> genus while Article 16 is a<lb/> species. Article 16 gives effect<lb/> to the doctrine of equality in all<lb/> matters relating to public<lb/> employment.<lb/> The<lb/> basic<lb/> principle<lb/> which,<lb/> therefore,<lb/> informs both Articles 14 and<lb/> 16 is equality and inhibition<lb/> against discrimination. Now,<lb/> what is the content and reach<lb/> of<lb/> this<lb/> great<lb/> equalising<lb/> principle? It is a founding<lb/> faith, to use the words of Bose.<lb/></item>

			<item>J., &quot;a way of life&quot;, and it must<lb/> not be subjected to a narrow<lb/> pedantic<lb/> or<lb/> lexicographic<lb/> approach.<lb/> We<lb/> cannot<lb/> countenance any attempt to<lb/> truncate<lb/> its<lb/> all-embracing<lb/> scope and meaning, for to do<lb/> so would be to violate its<lb/> activist magnitude. Equality is<lb/> a dynamic concept with many<lb/> aspects and dimensions and it<lb/> cannot be &quot;cribbed, cabined<lb/> and<lb/> confined&quot;<lb/> within<lb/> traditional<lb/> and<lb/> doctrinaire<lb/> limits. From a positivistic point<lb/> of view, equality is antithetic to<lb/> arbitrariness. In fact equality<lb/> and arbitrariness are sworn<lb/> enemies; one belongs to the rule<lb/> of law in a republic while the<lb/> other, to the whim and caprice<lb/> of an absolute monarch. Where<lb/> an act is arbitrary, it is implicit<lb/> in it that it is unequal both<lb/> according to political logic and<lb/> constitutional law and is<lb/> therefore violative of Article 14,<lb/> and if it effects any matter<lb/> relating to public employment,<lb/> it is also violative of Article<lb/> 16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at<lb/> arbitrariness in State action<lb/> and ensure fairness and<lb/> equality of treatment. They<lb/> require that State action must<lb/> be based on valid relevant<lb/> principles applicable alike to<lb/> all similarly situate and it<lb/> must not be guided by any<lb/> extraneous<lb/> or<lb/> irrelevant<lb/> considerations because that<lb/> would be denial of equality.<lb/> Where the operative reason for<lb/> State action, as distinguished<lb/> from motive inducing from the<lb/> antechamber of the mind, is<lb/> not legitimate and relevant but<lb/> is extraneous and outside the<lb/> area<lb/> of<lb/> permissible<lb/> considerations,<lb/> it<lb/> would<lb/> amount to mala fide exercise of<lb/> power and that is hit by<lb/> Articles 14 and 16. Mala fide<lb/> exercise<lb/> of<lb/> power<lb/> and<lb/> arbitrariness<lb/> are<lb/> different<lb/> lethal radiations emanating<lb/> from the same vice: in fact the<lb/> latter comprehends the former.<lb/> Both are inhibited by Articles<lb/> 14 and 16.&quot;<lb/> [Emphasis Supplied]<lb/></item>

			<p>82.<lb/> It is, therefore, clear from a<lb/> reading of even the aforesaid two<lb/> Constitution Bench judgments in<lb/> Mithu case (Mithu v. State of Punjab,<lb/> (1983)2 SCC 277) and Sunil Batra<lb/> (Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration,<lb/> (1978)4 SCC 494) case that Article 14<lb/> has been referred to in the context of<lb/> the<lb/> constitutional<lb/> invalidity<lb/> of<lb/> statutory law to show that such<lb/> statutory law will be struck down if it<lb/> is found to be &quot;arbitrary&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>100. To complete the picture, it is<lb/> important to note that subordinate<lb/> legislation can be struck down on the<lb/> ground that it is arbitrary and,<lb/> therefore, violative of Article 14 of the<lb/> Constitution. In Cellular Operators<lb/> Association of India v. Telecom<lb/> Regulatory Authority of India, (2016) 7<lb/> SCC 703, this Court referred to<lb/> earlier precedents, and held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Violation of fundamental rights<lb/> 42. We have already seen<lb/> that one of the tests for challenging<lb/> the constitutionality of subordinate<lb/> legislation is that subordinate<lb/> legislation<lb/> should<lb/> not<lb/> be<lb/> manifestly arbitrary. Also, it is<lb/> settled<lb/> law<lb/> that<lb/> subordinate<lb/> legislation can be challenged on<lb/> any of the grounds available for<lb/> challenge<lb/> against<lb/> plenary<lb/> legislation. (See Indian Express<lb/> Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v.<lb/> Union of India [(1985) 1 SCC 641:<lb/> 1985 SCC (Tax) 121], SCC at p.<lb/> 689, para 75.)<lb/></item>

			<item>43. The test of &quot;manifest<lb/> arbitrariness&quot; is well explained in<lb/> two judgments of this Court. In<lb/> Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State<lb/> of Karnataka [(1996) 10 SCC 304],<lb/> this Court held: (SCC p. 314, para<lb/> 13)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;13. It is next submitted<lb/> before us that the amended<lb/> Rules<lb/> are<lb/> arbitrary,<lb/> unreasonable and cause<lb/> undue<lb/> hardship<lb/> and,<lb/> therefore,<lb/> violate Article<lb/> 14 of<lb/> the<lb/> Constitution.<lb/> Although<lb/> the<lb/> protection<lb/> of Article 19(1)(g) may not be<lb/> available to the appellants,<lb/> the<lb/> Rules<lb/> must,<lb/> undoubtedly, satisfy the test<lb/> of Article 14, which is a<lb/> guarantee against arbitrary<lb/> action. However, one must<lb/> bear in mind that what is<lb/> being<lb/> challenged<lb/> here<lb/> under Article<lb/> 14 is<lb/> not<lb/> executive<lb/> action<lb/> but<lb/> delegated legislation. The<lb/> tests of arbitrary action<lb/> which apply to executive<lb/> actions do not necessarily<lb/> apply<lb/> to<lb/> delegated<lb/> legislation. In order that<lb/> delegated legislation can be<lb/> struck down, such legislation<lb/> must be manifestly arbitrary;<lb/> a law which could not be<lb/> reasonably<lb/> expected<lb/> to<lb/> emanate from an authority<lb/> delegated with the law-<lb/>making<lb/> power. In<lb/> Indian<lb/> Express<lb/> Newspapers<lb/> (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. Union of<lb/> India [(1985) 1 SCC 641 :<lb/> 1985 SCC (Tax) 121], this<lb/> Court said that a piece of<lb/> subordinate legislation does<lb/> not carry the same degree of<lb/> immunity which is enjoyed<lb/> by a statute passed by a<lb/> competent<lb/> legislature. A<lb/> subordinate legislation may<lb/> be questioned under Article<lb/> 14 on the ground that it is<lb/> unreasonable; &apos;unreasonable<lb/> not in the sense of not being<lb/> reasonable, but in the sense<lb/> that<lb/> it<lb/> is<lb/> manifestly<lb/> arbitrary&apos;.<lb/> Drawing<lb/> a<lb/> comparison between the law<lb/> in England and in India, the<lb/> Court further observed that<lb/> in England the Judges<lb/> would say, &apos;Parliament never<lb/> intended the authority to<lb/> make such Rules; they are<lb/> unreasonable<lb/> and<lb/> ultra<lb/> vires&apos;. In India, arbitrariness<lb/> is not a separate ground<lb/> since it will come within the<lb/> embargo of Article 14 of the<lb/> Constitution. But subordinate<lb/> legislation<lb/> must<lb/> be<lb/> so<lb/> arbitrary that it could not be<lb/> said to be in conformity with<lb/> the statute or that it<lb/> offends Article<lb/> 14 of<lb/> the<lb/> Constitution.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>44. Also, in Sharma Transport v.<lb/> State of A.P. [(2002) 2 SCC 188],<lb/> this Court held: (SCC pp. 203-04,<lb/> para 25)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;25. … The tests of<lb/> arbitrary action applicable<lb/> to executive action do not<lb/> necessarily<lb/> apply<lb/> to<lb/> delegated<lb/> legislation.<lb/> In<lb/> order to strike down a<lb/> delegated<lb/> legislation<lb/> as<lb/> arbitrary it has to be<lb/> established that there is<lb/> manifest arbitrariness. In<lb/> order to be described as<lb/> arbitrary, it must be shown<lb/> that it was not reasonable<lb/> and manifestly arbitrary.<lb/> The expression &quot;arbitrarily&quot;<lb/> means: in an unreasonable<lb/> manner, as fixed or done<lb/> capriciously or at pleasure,<lb/> without<lb/> adequate<lb/> determining principle, not<lb/> founded in the nature of<lb/> things, non-rational, not<lb/> done or acting according to<lb/> reason<lb/> or<lb/> judgment,<lb/> depending<lb/> on<lb/> the<lb/> will<lb/> alone.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>50. A plain reading of sub-section (1) of<lb/> Section 9 would indicate that Special Court<lb/> constituted under the Act is empowered to take<lb/> cognizance either suo motu or on an application.<lb/> This power vested to the Special Court cannot be<lb/> construed either as having vested the said Special<lb/> Court with unbridled power or there being abdication<lb/> of power by the State. The object of such power<lb/> being vested with the Special Court can be traced<lb/> from the statement of objects and reasons assigned<lb/> for bringing in the impugned legislation. There might<lb/> be instances where the officials of the State being<lb/> hand in glove with the perpetrators of crime and<lb/> thereby deprive the State of its valuable property, and<lb/> the fact of either records being suppressed or no<lb/> action being taken against the erring persons, cannot<lb/> be ruled out. There might be varied circumstances<lb/> under which the factum of the land grabbing is being<lb/> brought to limelight. For instance, public spirited<lb/> person may unearth the misdeeds or misgivings of<lb/> the acts of land grabbing or the fourth pillar of the<lb/> democracy namely, the Press (both print and<lb/> electronic media) may highlight the factum of<lb/> Government land having been grabbed or usurped by<lb/> unscrupulous persons for personal gain.<lb/> The<lb/> instances of Government land abutting the private<lb/> land having been usurped either under the garb of<lb/> ignorance or otherwise, also cannot be ruled out.<lb/> The instances of such incidents as indicated in the<lb/> A.T.Ramaswamy&apos;s Report, is also one of the reasons<lb/> for which the impugned enactment having come into<lb/> force. It is for these myriad reasons, the Special<lb/> Court has been vested with the power to take<lb/> cognizance of and try case arising out of any alleged<lb/> act of land grabbing either suo motu or on an<lb/> application. The said power cannot be construed as<lb/> State having abdicated of its power. In fact, it is<lb/> extending its arm of power to the citizens to bring to<lb/> the notice of the Special Court of any act of land<lb/> grabbing in any form whatsoever, which sub-serves<lb/> the larger public interest. It would not be out of<lb/> context to refer to Regulation 29 of the Karnataka<lb/> Land<lb/> Grabbing<lb/> Prohibition<lb/> (Special<lb/> Court)<lb/> Regulation, 2017, which prescribes the procedure for<lb/> taking suo motu cognizance and Regulation 29 reads:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;29. Procedure for suo motu<lb/> action:-Where the Chairman or<lb/> any member of the Special Court<lb/> desires that any case shall be<lb/> taken cognizance of suo motu, he<lb/> may record a statement of facts<lb/> within his knowledge and place it<lb/> before the Special Court.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>51. It will always be presumed that the said<lb/> power of taking suo motu cognizance would be<lb/> exercised cautiously depending upon the facts<lb/> obtained in that particular matter. It would also be<lb/> of benefit to note that object of impugned legislation<lb/> is to remedy or curb the acts of grabbing of<lb/> Government lands and in many a circumstances or<lb/> instances the general public may also be loath or<lb/> hesitant to lodge complaints fearing backlash from<lb/> the mighty and powerful persons who indulge in land<lb/> grabbing, if they were to be seen as complainants. In<lb/> such circumstances, the print and electronic media<lb/> also play a pivotal role in highlighting the instances<lb/> of land grabbing. If the legislature has in its wisdom<lb/> thought fit to cloth the Special Court the power of<lb/> taking &quot;suo motu cognizance&quot;, to prevent the<lb/> &quot;public wrong&quot;, it cannot be gainsaid that it is an<lb/> unbridled power vested to the Special Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>52. It is trite law that cognizance would be<lb/> taken with due application of mind by the Special<lb/> Court as otherwise it would find foul of there being<lb/> no due application of mind and thereby amenable for<lb/> interference either under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. or<lb/> under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of<lb/> India as the case may be.<lb/></p>

			<p>53. It would be of<lb/> benefit to note that<lb/> Sections 190, 200 to 203 found in Chapter XIV and<lb/> XV of the Cr.P.C which deals with the mode of taking<lb/> cognizance, postponement of issue of process to the<lb/> accused, dismissal of the complaint. They are akin to<lb/> sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the impugned Act and<lb/> Regulation 29. Hence, we are of the considered view<lb/> the analysis of the provisions as found in Cr.P.C.<lb/> requires to be noticed.<lb/> A Magistrate taking<lb/> cognizance of an offence on a complaint, is required<lb/> to examine the complainant on oath and witnesses<lb/> present, if any. Section 202 of Cr.P.C. provides that a<lb/> Magistrate taking cognizance of a case upon<lb/> complaint, may, if he thinks fit, postpone the issue of<lb/> process against the accused, and either inquire into<lb/> the case himself or direct an investigation to be made<lb/> by a police officer or by such other person, as he<lb/> thinks fit, for the purposes of deciding, whether or<lb/> not<lb/> there<lb/> is<lb/> sufficient<lb/> ground<lb/> for<lb/> proceeding. Section 203 of Cr.P.C. empowers the<lb/> Magistrate to dismiss the complaint, if, after<lb/> considering the statements on oath (if any) of the<lb/> complainant and of the witnesses and the result of<lb/> enquiry or investigation (if any) under Section 202, if<lb/> he is of the opinion that there is no sufficient ground<lb/> for proceeding. In fact, this provision is akin to<lb/> proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 9 of<lb/> KLGP Act-2011.<lb/></p>

			<p>53.1 Chapter XVI deals with &apos;commencement<lb/> of proceedings before Magistrates&apos; and Section 204 of<lb/> Cr.P.C. enables a Magistrate to issue summons or a<lb/> warrant, as the case may be, to secure the<lb/> attendance of the accused, if in the opinion of the<lb/> Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence there is<lb/> sufficient grounds for proceeding.<lb/></p>

			<p>53.2 Thus, Magistrate on receipt of a<lb/> complaint has several courses open to him. Section<lb/> 190(1)(a)(b) and<lb/> (c)<lb/> of Cr.P.C.<lb/> empowers<lb/> the<lb/> Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence under<lb/> three circumstances. Under Section 190(1)(a) the<lb/> Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance where<lb/> the complaint which satisfies the definition of Section<lb/> 2(d) of Cr.P.C., and containing the allegations which<lb/> are sufficient to constitute such offence under any<lb/> penal law for the time being in force. Under Section<lb/> 190(1)(b) upon a police report of such facts namely, if<lb/> an aggrieved person has directly approached the<lb/> police by filing FIR under Section 154 Cr.P.C. and<lb/> after due investigation, if the police files a report to<lb/> the Court and if the said report contains the<lb/> allegations, which are sufficient to constitute offence,<lb/> even then Magistrate would be empowered to take<lb/> cognizance on the basis of such police report.<lb/> However, the Magistrate would not be bound by the<lb/> opinion of the police but such opinion would be<lb/> formed on the basis of materials furnished by the<lb/> police in the report and if the Magistrate is of the<lb/> opinion that there are sufficient grounds to proceed<lb/> against the accused and said report would disclose<lb/> that it would constitute an offence, then also<lb/> Magistrate can take cognizance and issue summons.<lb/> Lastly, under Section 190(1)(c) of Cr.P.C. upon<lb/> information received from any person other than a<lb/> police officer, or upon his own knowledge, that such<lb/> offence has been committed, he may take cognizance<lb/> of the offence and proceed to record the statements of<lb/> the complainant and witnesses present under section<lb/> 200 Cr.P.C. Thereafter, if in his opinion there is no<lb/> sufficient ground for proceeding, he may dismiss the<lb/> complaint under Section 203 Cr.P.C or if in his<lb/> opinion there is sufficient ground for proceeding, he<lb/> may issue process under Section 204 Cr.P.C.<lb/> However, if he thinks fit, he may postpone the issue<lb/> of process and either enquire into the case himself or<lb/> direct an investigation to be made by a police officer<lb/> or such other person, as he thinks fit for the purpose<lb/> of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground<lb/> for proceeding. He may also issue process, if in his<lb/> opinion there is sufficient ground for proceeding.<lb/></p>

			<p>53.3 At the first instance, on receipt of a<lb/> complaint, Magistrate instead of taking cognizance of<lb/> an offence he may order an investigation<lb/> under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. The police will then<lb/> investigate and submit a report under Section<lb/> 173(1) Cr.P.C. On receiving the police report the<lb/> Magistrate may take cognizance of the offence<lb/> under Section 190(1)(b) Cr.P.C. and straight away<lb/> issue process. This he may do irrespective of the view<lb/> expressed by the police in their report.<lb/></p>

			<p>54. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in GHCL<lb/> EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTION TRUST vs INDIA<lb/> INFOLINE LIMITED &amp; OTHERS reported in (2013)4<lb/> SCC 505 has held that Magistrate who issued<lb/> summons by not recording the satisfaction about<lb/> primafacie case against the respondents was illegal<lb/> and amounted to abuse of process of law as<lb/> summoning of accused in a criminal case is a serious<lb/> matter and as a matter of course, the criminal law<lb/> cannot be set into motion. It has been further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;14. Be that as it may, as held by<lb/> this Court, summoning of accused<lb/> in a criminal case is a serious<lb/> matter. Hence, criminal law cannot<lb/> be set into motion as a matter of<lb/> course. The order of Magistrate<lb/> summoning the accused must<lb/> reflect that he has applied his mind<lb/> to the facts of the case and the law<lb/> applicable thereto. The Magistrate<lb/> has to record his satisfaction with<lb/> regard to the existence of a prima<lb/> facie case on the basis of specific<lb/> allegations made in the complaint<lb/> supported by satisfactory evidence<lb/> and other material on record.<lb/></item>

			<p>15. In the case of Madhavrao Jiwaji<lb/> Rao Scindia and Another Etc. vs.<lb/> Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre<lb/> and Others Etc. AIR 1988 SC 709,<lb/> this Court held as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;7. The legal position is well-<lb/>settled<lb/> that<lb/> when<lb/> a<lb/> prosecution at the initial stage<lb/> is asked to be quashed, the<lb/> test to be applied by the court<lb/> is<lb/> as<lb/> to<lb/> whether<lb/> the<lb/> uncontroverted allegations as<lb/> made prima facie establish the<lb/> offence. It is also for the court<lb/> to take into consideration any<lb/> special features which appear<lb/> in a particular case to consider<lb/> whether it is expedient and in<lb/> the interest of justice to permit<lb/> a prosecution to continue. This<lb/> is so on the basis that the<lb/> court cannot be utilised for<lb/> any oblique purpose and<lb/> where in the opinion of the<lb/> court chances of an ultimate<lb/> conviction<lb/> is<lb/> bleak<lb/> and,<lb/> therefore, no useful purpose is<lb/> likely to be served by allowing<lb/> a criminal prosecution to<lb/> continue, the court may while<lb/> taking into consideration the<lb/> special facts of a case also<lb/> quash the proceeding even<lb/> though it may be at a<lb/> preliminary stage.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>16. In the case of Punjab National<lb/> Bank and Others vs. Surendra Prasad<lb/> Sinha, AIR 1992 SC 1815, a<lb/> complaint<lb/> was<lb/> lodged<lb/> by<lb/> the<lb/> complainant for prosecution under<lb/> Sections 409, 109<lb/> and<lb/> 114,<lb/> IPC against<lb/> the<lb/> Chairman,<lb/> the<lb/> Managing Director of the Bank and a<lb/> host of officers alleging, inter alia, that<lb/> as against the loan granted to one<lb/> Sriman<lb/> Narain<lb/> Dubey<lb/> the<lb/> complainant and his wife stood as<lb/> guarantors and executed Security<lb/> Bond and handed over Fixed Deposit<lb/> Receipt. Since the principal debtor<lb/> defaulted in payment of debt, the<lb/> Branch Manager of the Bank on<lb/> maturity of the said fixed deposit<lb/> adjusted a part of the amount against<lb/> the said loan. The complainant alleged<lb/> that the debt became barred by<lb/> limitation and, therefore, the liability<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> guarantors<lb/> also<lb/> stood<lb/> extinguished. It was, therefore, alleged<lb/> that the officers of the Bank criminally<lb/> embezzled the said amount with<lb/> dishonest<lb/> intention<lb/> to<lb/> save<lb/> themselves from financial obligation.<lb/> The Magistrate without adverting<lb/> whether the allegations in the<lb/> complaint prime facie make out an<lb/> offence charged for, in a mechanical<lb/> manner, issued the process against all<lb/> the accused persons. The High Court<lb/> refused to quash the complaint and<lb/> the matter finally came to this Court.<lb/> Allowing the appeal and quashing the<lb/> complaint, this Court held as under:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;5. It is also salutary to note<lb/> that judicial process should<lb/> not be an instrument of<lb/> oppression<lb/> or<lb/> needless<lb/> harassment. The complaint<lb/> was<lb/> laid<lb/> impleading<lb/> the<lb/> Chairman,<lb/> the<lb/> Managing<lb/> Director of the Bank by name<lb/> and a host of officers. There<lb/> lies responsibility and duty on<lb/> the Magistracy to find whether<lb/> the concerned accused should<lb/> be legally responsible for the<lb/> offence charged for. Only on<lb/> satisfying that the law casts<lb/> liability or creates offence<lb/> against the juristic person or<lb/> the persons impleaded then<lb/> only process would be issued.<lb/> At that stage the court would<lb/> be circumspect and judicious<lb/> in exercising discretion and<lb/> should take all the relevant<lb/> facts and circumstances into<lb/> consideration before issuing<lb/> process lest it would be an<lb/> instrument in the hands of the<lb/> private<lb/> complainant<lb/> as<lb/> vendetta to harass the persons<lb/> needlessly.<lb/> Vindication<lb/> of<lb/> majesty<lb/> of<lb/> justice<lb/> and<lb/> maintenance of law and order<lb/> in the society are the prime<lb/> objects of criminal justice but<lb/> it would not be the means to<lb/> wreak personal vengeance.<lb/> Considered from any angle we<lb/> find that the respondent had<lb/> abused the process and laid<lb/> complaint against all the<lb/> appellants without any prima<lb/> facie case to harass them for<lb/> vendetta.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>17. In the case of Maksud Saiyed vs.<lb/> State of Gujarat and Others (2008) 5<lb/> SCC 668, this Court while discussing<lb/> vicarious liability observed as under :-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;13. Where a jurisdiction is<lb/> exercised on a complaint<lb/> petition<lb/> filed<lb/> in<lb/> terms<lb/> of Section<lb/> 156(3) or Section<lb/> 200 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, the Magistrate is<lb/> required to apply his mind.<lb/> The Penal<lb/> Code does<lb/> not<lb/> contain any provision for<lb/> attaching vicarious liability on<lb/> the part of the Managing<lb/> Director or the Directors of the<lb/> Company when the accused is<lb/> the Company. The learned<lb/> Magistrate failed to pose unto<lb/> himself the correct question<lb/> viz., as to whether the<lb/> complaint petition, even if<lb/> given face value and taken to<lb/> be correct in its entirety, would<lb/> lead to the conclusion that the<lb/> respondents<lb/> herein<lb/> were<lb/> personally<lb/> liable<lb/> for<lb/> any<lb/> offence. The Bank is a body<lb/> corporate. Vicarious liability of<lb/> the Managing Director and<lb/> Director would arise provided<lb/> any provision exists in that<lb/> behalf in the statute. Statutes<lb/> indisputably<lb/> must<lb/> contain<lb/> provision fixing such vicarious<lb/> liabilities. Even for the said<lb/> purpose, it is obligatory on the<lb/> part of the complainant to<lb/> make<lb/> requisite<lb/> allegations<lb/> which<lb/> would<lb/> attract<lb/> the<lb/> provisions<lb/> constituting<lb/> vicarious liability.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>55.<lb/> Thus, from the above analysis, when the<lb/> impugned legislation is examined, it would clearly<lb/> emerge therefrom that Special Court under sub-<lb/>section (1) of Section 9 is empowered to either suo<lb/> motu or on an application made by any person,<lb/> Officer or authority, to take cognizance of and try<lb/> every case arising out of any alleged act of land<lb/> grabbing and if it is relating to civil dispute, it would<lb/> be empowered to adjudicate the ownership and title<lb/> or lawful possession of the land alleged to have been<lb/> grabbed and also try for the offences specified in<lb/> Chapter XIV-A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act,<lb/> 1964.<lb/></p>

			<p>56. As noticed herein above, the Chairman of<lb/> the Special Court would be a person who is or was<lb/> Judge of a High Court and of the other four members,<lb/> two would be of the rank of District Judges and<lb/> remaining two would be not below the rank of a<lb/> Deputy Commissioner. It is presumed that Court<lb/> presided by the respective Judges would take<lb/> cognizance of the offence under the Act only after due<lb/> application of mind. Even assuming for a moment, if<lb/> there were to be instances of any infraction in the<lb/> manner, mode and method of taking cognizance, it<lb/> would always be amenable to judicial scrutiny by the<lb/> higher forum i.e., before the High Court in a petition<lb/> filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India or<lb/> under Section 482 Cr.P.C. as the case may be.<lb/></p>

			<p>57. Thus,<lb/> while<lb/> ordering<lb/> issuance<lb/> of<lb/> summons, the Special Court has to necessarily<lb/> record its satisfaction about the primafacie case<lb/> against accused, which is sine qua non for initiating<lb/> criminal action against an accused. Thus, when sub-<lb/>section (1) is read along with sub-section (2) of<lb/> Section 9, it would clearly indicate that it is not only<lb/> due application of mind with regard to the allegation<lb/> made in the complaint or the material available<lb/> before the Special Court which would be the prime<lb/> factor for taking cognizance of the offence, but also<lb/> the location of the land alleged to have been grabbed,<lb/> or extent or value of the land or the substantial<lb/> nature of evil involved or any other relevant matter in<lb/> the interest of justice i.e., to protect the public<lb/> property, the Special Court will have to arrive at a<lb/> conclusion for taking cognizance by objective<lb/> assessment of all the material and by recording<lb/> subjective satisfaction. In that view of the matter,<lb/> we are of the considered view that contention<lb/> raised by learned Advocates appearing for the<lb/> petitioners that Section 9(1) and Section 9(2) is<lb/> vice of arbitrariness cannot be accepted and it<lb/> stands rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>58. Sub-section (3) of Section 9, pre-<lb/>amendment enabled the Special Court to try the<lb/> offences of land grabbing or the determination of<lb/> question of title and ownership to, or lawful<lb/> possession of any land grabbed under the Act and<lb/> offences specified in Chapter -XIVA of Karnataka<lb/> Land Revenue Act and its decision thereof was held<lb/> to be final. The proviso thereto enabled the Special<lb/> Court to reject an application filed before it, if it was<lb/> of prima facie opinion that it was frivolous and<lb/> vexatious. Sub-section (3) came to be substituted by<lb/> Act 30 of 2020, under which all acts of land grabbing<lb/> is required to be tried only by the Special Court<lb/> constituted for the area in which land is situated, or<lb/> where there are more Special Courts than one for<lb/> such area, by such one of them as may be specified<lb/> in this behalf by the Government. Thus, Special<lb/> Court constituted under Section 7 of the KLGP Act-<lb/>2011 empowers the Special Court to try all acts of<lb/> land grabbing including those offences specified in<lb/> Chapter XIV-A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act,<lb/> 1964. Said provision is neither arbitrary nor lacks<lb/> any clarity. Hence, we are not inclined to accept the<lb/> contention raised by the learned Advocates appearing<lb/> for the petitioners and all contentions raised in that<lb/> regard is rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>59. Section 9(4) confers a discretion on the<lb/> Special Court to determine the order or sequence in<lb/> which civil and criminal liability against a land<lb/> grabber be initiated. It has been contended by the<lb/> petitioners that such unguided discretion on the<lb/> Special Court is arbitrary and unconstitutional. It<lb/> can be noticed with benefit that Chairman of the<lb/> Special Court would be a person who is or was a<lb/> Judge of a High Court and such person who has held<lb/> a high constitutional post, would definitely exercise<lb/> the discretion while exercising the powers under sub-<lb/>section (4) of Section 9 and necessarily after due<lb/> application of mind.<lb/></p>

			<p>60. It has also been contended that procedure<lb/> prescribed under the impugned enactment is harsher<lb/> and therefore arbitrary. The mere availability of two<lb/> (2) procedures would not vitiate one of the procedure<lb/> so prescribed, as held by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in<lb/> MAGANLAL CHHAGANLAL (P) LTD. vs. MUNICIPAL<lb/> CORPORATION OF GREATER BOMBAY AND<lb/> ANOTHER reported in (1974)2 SCC 402. It has<lb/> been held:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;14. To summarise: Where a statute<lb/> providing for a more drastic procedure<lb/> different from the ordinary procedure<lb/> covers the whole field covered by the<lb/> ordinary procedure, as in Anwar Ali<lb/> Sarkar&apos;s case and Suraj Mall Mehta&apos;s<lb/> case without any guidelines as to the<lb/> class of cases in which either<lb/> procedure is to be resorted to, the<lb/> statute will be hit by Article 14. Even<lb/> there, as mentioned in Suraj Mall<lb/> Mehta&apos;s case, a provision for appeal<lb/> may cure the defect. Further, in such<lb/> cases if from the preamble and<lb/> surrounding circumstances, as well as<lb/> the provisions of the statute themselves<lb/> explained and amplified by affidavits,<lb/> necessary guidelines could be inferred<lb/> as in Saurashtra case (supra) and Jyoti<lb/> Pershad&apos;s case (supra) the statute will<lb/> not be hit by Art. 14. Then again where<lb/> tile statute itself covers only a class of<lb/> cases as in Haldar&apos;s case (supra) and<lb/> Bajoria&apos;s case (supra) the statute will<lb/> not be bad. The fact that in such cases<lb/> the executive will choose which cases<lb/> are to be tried under the special<lb/> procedure will not affect the validity of<lb/> the statute. Therefore, the contention<lb/> that the mere availability of two<lb/> procedures will vitiate one of them, that<lb/> is the special procedure, is not<lb/> supported by reason or authority.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. The statute itself in<lb/> the two classes of cases before us<lb/> clearly lays down the purpose<lb/> behind them, that is premises<lb/> belonging to the Corporation and<lb/> the Government should be subject<lb/> to speedy procedure in the matter<lb/> of evicting unauthorized persons<lb/> occupying<lb/></p>

			<item>them.<lb/> This<lb/> is<lb/> a<lb/> sufficient<lb/> guidance<lb/> for<lb/> the<lb/> authorities on whom the power has<lb/> been conferred. With such an<lb/> indication clearly given in the<lb/> statutes one expects the officers<lb/> concerned to avail themselves of<lb/> the procedures prescribed by the<lb/> Acts and not resort to the dilatory<lb/> procedure of the ordinary Civil<lb/> Court. Even normally one cannot<lb/> imagine an officer having the<lb/> choice of two procedures, one<lb/> which<lb/> enables<lb/> him<lb/> to<lb/> get<lb/> possession of the property quickly<lb/> and the other which would be a<lb/> prolonged one, to resort to the<lb/> latter. Administrative officers, no<lb/> less than the courts, do not<lb/> function in a vacuum. It would be<lb/> extremely unreal to hold that an<lb/> administrative officer would in<lb/> taking proceedings for eviction of<lb/> unauthorised<lb/> occupants<lb/> of<lb/> Government property or Municipal<lb/> property resort to the procedure<lb/> prescribed by the two Acts. in one<lb/> case and to the ordinary Civil<lb/> Court in the other. The provisions<lb/> of these two Acts cannot be struck<lb/> down on the fanciful theory that<lb/> power would be exercised in such<lb/> an<lb/> unrealistic<lb/> fashion.<lb/> In<lb/> considering whether the officers<lb/> would be discriminating between<lb/> one set of persons and another,<lb/> one has got to take into account<lb/> normal human behaviour and not<lb/> behaviour which is abnormal. It is<lb/> not every fancied possibility of<lb/> discrimination but the real risk of<lb/> discrimination that we must take<lb/> into account. This is not one of<lb/> those cases where discrimination<lb/> is writ large on the face of the<lb/> statute. Discrimination may be<lb/> possible but is very improbable.<lb/> And if there is discrimination in<lb/> actual practice this Court is not<lb/> powerless. Furthermore, the fact<lb/> that the Legislature considered<lb/> that the ordinary procedure is<lb/> insufficient or ineffective in evicting<lb/> unauthorised<lb/> occupants<lb/> of<lb/> Government<lb/> and<lb/> Corporation<lb/> property and provided a special<lb/> speedy procedure therefore is a<lb/> clear guidance for the authorities<lb/> charged with the duty of evicting<lb/> unauthorised<lb/> occupants.<lb/> We,<lb/> therefore, find ourselves unable to<lb/> agree with the majority in the<lb/> Northern India Caterers&apos; case<lb/> (supra).&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>61. It is well settled law that mere possibility<lb/> of abuse of a provision does not affect its<lb/> constitutionality. Therefore, the mere fact that the<lb/> discretion conferred upon on the court may possibly<lb/> be misused, cannot be a ground to strike down the<lb/> validity of a provision. For this proposition the<lb/> judgment of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in SANJAY<lb/> DUTT vs. STATE THROUGH CBI reported in (1994)<lb/> 5 SCC 410 can be looked up. A Special Court under<lb/> the KLGP Act is headed by a retired Judge and there<lb/> cannot be any doubt or apprehension about a person<lb/> who held a high constitutional post would not<lb/> exercise discretion under Section 9(4) with due<lb/> application of mind.<lb/> It is presumed that the<lb/> provisions of the statute would be applied in fair and<lb/> reasonable manner to achieve the avowed object of<lb/> the Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>62. It has also been contended that Section<lb/> 9(4) of the Act is to be declared as violative of Articles<lb/> 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, as it<lb/> prescribes evidence admitted during criminal<lb/> proceedings may be used while trying civil liability,<lb/> but additional evidence if any adduced, in the civil<lb/> proceedings shall not be considered by the Special<lb/> Court while determining the criminal liability.<lb/></p>

			<p>63. In other words, portion of sub-section (4)<lb/> of Section 9 is called in question before this Court on<lb/> the ground that additional evidence adduced in a civil<lb/> proceeding before the Special Court cannot be<lb/> considered by the Special Court while determining<lb/> the criminal liability of land grabbing. At the cost of<lb/> repetition, sub-section (4) of Section 9 is being<lb/> extracted herein below:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;9(4) The Special Court shall<lb/> determine the order in which the<lb/> civil and criminal liability against a<lb/> land grabber be initiated. It shall be<lb/> within the discretion of the Special<lb/> Court whether or not to deliver its<lb/> decision or order until both civil and<lb/> criminal proceedings are completed.<lb/> The evidence admitted during the<lb/> criminal proceeding may be made<lb/> use of while trying the civil<lb/> liability. But additional evidence, if<lb/> any adduced<lb/> in the civil<lb/> proceedings shall not be considered<lb/> by<lb/> the<lb/> Special<lb/> Court<lb/> while<lb/> determining the criminal liability.<lb/> Any person accused of land grabbing<lb/> or the abetment thereof before the<lb/> Special Court shall be a competent<lb/> witness for the defence and may give<lb/> evidence on oath in disproof of the<lb/> charge made against him or any<lb/> person charged together with him in<lb/> the criminal proceeding:<lb/> Provided that he shall not be called<lb/> as a witness except on his own<lb/> request in writing or his failure to give<lb/> evidence shall be made the subject of<lb/> any comment by any of the parties or<lb/> the Special Court or give rise to any<lb/> presumption against himself or any<lb/> person charged together with him at<lb/> the same proceeding.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>64. A plain reading of the language employed<lb/> in sub-section (4) in general and in particular, two<lb/> sentences on which emphasis has been laid as<lb/> indicated herein above would reveal that evidence<lb/> admitted during the criminal proceedings against the<lb/> land grabber may be made use of while trying the<lb/> civil liability. But the converse would be inapplicable.<lb/> In the sense that additional evidence, if any, adduced<lb/> in the civil proceedings initiated against the land<lb/> grabber before the Special Court, shall not be<lb/> considered by the said court while determining the<lb/> criminal liability.<lb/> If the evidence admitted during<lb/> criminal proceedings can be admitted while trying the<lb/> civil liability before the Special Court, it is highly un-<lb/>understandable as to how additional evidence if any<lb/> adduced in the civil proceedings against the same<lb/> person before the Special Court would become<lb/> inadmissible in determining the criminal liability.<lb/> The expression of these emphasized sentences in<lb/> sub-section (4) does not seem to be happily worded.<lb/> A plain meaning which can be attached to the said<lb/> sentence, would make it clear that main evidence<lb/> recorded in the civil proceedings can be considered<lb/> by the Special Court while determining the criminal<lb/> liability but not additional evidence. This inhibition<lb/> is nothing but an inhibition against rule of best<lb/> evidence.<lb/></p>

			<p>65. There cannot be any dispute to the fact<lb/> that the procedure to be adopted for determination of<lb/> title to the land would be a detailed procedure<lb/> namely, as it is adopted by the regular civil court of<lb/> competent jurisdiction and not a court or tribunal<lb/> dealing with summary jurisdiction. Similarly, the<lb/> Special Court dealing with an offence under the Act,<lb/> will have to apply the procedure contemplated for a<lb/> warrant case. If the witnesses who have deposed<lb/> before the Special Court with regard to civil liability is<lb/> favourable to the accused in the Special Court, the<lb/> same could be used in terms of Section 145 of the<lb/> Evidence Act, 1872. It reads:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;145. Cross examination as to<lb/> previous statements in writing.-<lb/>A witness may be cross examined<lb/> as to previous statements made by<lb/> him in writing or reduced into<lb/> writing, and relevant to matters in<lb/> question, without such writing<lb/> being shown to him, or being<lb/> proved; but, if it is intended to<lb/> contradict him by the writing, his<lb/> attention must, before the writing<lb/> can be proved, be called to those<lb/> parts of it which are to be used for<lb/> the purpose of contradicting him.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>66. On plain reading of aforesaid Section, it<lb/> would indicate, it has two parts namely:<lb/></p>

			<p>(a) A witness may be cross examined as<lb/> to previous statement made by him<lb/> in writing or reduced to writing and<lb/> relevant to the matters in question,<lb/> without such writing being shown to<lb/> him or being proved;<lb/></p>

			<p>(b) To contradict him by the writing, his<lb/> attention must be drawn to the<lb/> relevant parts of it, before proving<lb/> the writing.<lb/> By adopting the method prescribed under Section<lb/> 146(3), it can be held that one of the method of<lb/> impeaching the credit worthiness of the witness is by<lb/> proof of inconsistency of previous statement. Of<lb/> course, other relevant Sections for impeaching the<lb/> credit worthiness of the witnesses can be traced to<lb/> Sections 138, 140, 146 and 154 of the Evidence Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>67. If the evidence admitted during criminal<lb/> proceedings could be admitted while trying the civil<lb/> liability, the converse must also be applicable with<lb/> equal force. Hence, in the light of improper framing of<lb/> particular sentence mentioned above and gravity of<lb/> civil or criminal cases is to be tried by the Special<lb/> Court and the serious consequences flowing for<lb/> violation of the provisions of KLGP Act-2011, the<lb/> inhibition above referred to has to be necessarily held<lb/> as onerous. The discrimination found in sub-section<lb/> (4) about the admissibility of the evidence does not<lb/> appeal to logic<lb/> and it also does not have any<lb/> rationale or nexus to the rule of best evidence.<lb/> Hence, this aspect is being clarified by us as<lb/> indicated herein below.<lb/></p>

			<p>68. If the language in sub-section (4) of<lb/> Section 9 was clear and unambiguous, there could<lb/> not have been any quarrel in that regard namely, if<lb/> the said provision only provided for or it was<lb/> prescribed &quot;that only evidence admitted during<lb/> civil proceedings may be used while trying the<lb/> criminal liability, but not vice versa&quot;, since it<lb/> would have appealed to logic and protected from<lb/> being attacked on the vice of being arbitrary. It would<lb/> also have ensured that criminal proceedings are tried<lb/> independently and no evidence admitted during civil<lb/> proceedings can be used to convict a person. This<lb/> would have been a protective provision to ensure the<lb/> sanctity of the criminal proceedings and insulated<lb/> the accused of being convicted on the basis of<lb/> evidence admitted during the civil proceedings or the<lb/> evidence admitted during civil proceedings being<lb/> used against a person who is charged with criminal<lb/> liability. It is needless to state that the nature of<lb/> evidence adduced in a civil proceedings is different<lb/> from that adduced from criminal proceedings.<lb/></p>

			<p>69. The fundamental tenet of administrative<lb/> law being the evidence and findings used in a<lb/> criminal trial cannot be used as a evidence in civil<lb/> case, on the contrary the evidence and findings in a<lb/> civil trial can be used as a evidence in a criminal<lb/> case. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the case of VISHNU<lb/> DUTT SHARMA vs. DAYA SAPRA reported in (2009)<lb/> 13 SCC 729 has held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;23. It brings us to the question as to<lb/> whether previous judgment of a<lb/> criminal proceeding would be relevant<lb/> in a suit. Section 40 of the Evidence<lb/> Act reads as under:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;40. Previous judgments relevant<lb/> to bar a second suit or trial. -The<lb/> existence of any judgment, order or<lb/> decree which by law prevents any<lb/> Courts from taking Cognizance of a<lb/> suit or holding a trial is a relevant fact<lb/> when the question is whether such<lb/> Court ought to take cognizance of<lb/> such suit or to hold such trial.&quot;<lb/> This principle would, therefore, be<lb/> applicable, inter alia, if the suit is<lb/> found to be barred by the principle of<lb/> res judicata or by reason of the<lb/> provisions of any other statute. It does<lb/> not lay down that a judgment of the<lb/> criminal court would be admissible in<lb/> the civil court for its relevance is<lb/> limited. (See Seth Ramdayal Jat v.<lb/> Laxmi Prasad). The judgment of a<lb/> criminal court in a civil proceeding<lb/> will only have limited application, viz.,<lb/> inter alia, for the purpose as to who<lb/> was the accused and what was the<lb/> result of the criminal proceedings.<lb/> Any finding in a criminal proceeding<lb/> by no stretch of imagination would be<lb/> binding in a civil proceeding.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;28. If judgment of a civil court is not<lb/> binding on a criminal court, it is<lb/> incomprehensible that a judgment of<lb/> a criminal court will be binding on a<lb/> civil<lb/> court.<lb/> We<lb/> have<lb/> noticed<lb/> hereinbefore that Section 43 of the<lb/> Evidence Act categorically states that<lb/> judgments, orders or decrees, other<lb/> than those mentioned in sections<lb/> 40, 41 and 42 are irrelevant, unless<lb/> the existence of such judgment, order<lb/> or decree, is a fact in issue, or is<lb/> relevant in some other provisions of<lb/> the Act, no other provisions of<lb/> the Evidence Act or for that matter<lb/> any other statute had been brought to<lb/> our notice.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>70. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the case of<lb/> SHREYA SINGHAL vs UNION OF INDIA reported in<lb/> (2015)5 SCC 1, it has been held that penal law is<lb/> void for vagueness if it fails to define criminal offence<lb/> with sufficient definiteness, the doctrine of &apos;void for<lb/> vagueness&apos; is discussed by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court<lb/> in K.A.ABBAS vs UNION OF INDIA reported in<lb/> (1970)2 SCC 780 wherein, the judgment in STATE<lb/> OF MADHYA PRADESH AND ANOTHER Vs<lb/> BELDEO PRASAD reported in AIR 1961 SC 293 had<lb/> been referred to under which, the Central Provinces<lb/> and Berar Goondas Act, 1946 was declared void for<lb/> uncertainty on the ground the definition of the word<lb/> &quot;Goonda&quot; occurring in the Act indicating no tests for<lb/> deciding which person fell within the said definition<lb/> and the condition for the application of Section 4 and<lb/> 4A against a person sought to be proceeded must be<lb/> a Goonda, was lacking. It was held in the ultimate<lb/> analysis that vagueness and clarity would be a<lb/> ground for striking down the provision as it would<lb/> offend the personal liberty guaranteed under Article<lb/> 21 of Constitution of India.<lb/></p>

			<p>71. Sub-section (4) of Section 9 provides for<lb/> making use of evidence admitted during criminal<lb/> proceedings while dealing with civil liability. Further,<lb/> it also says that additional if any adduced in the civil<lb/> proceedings shall not be considered by the Special<lb/> Court while determining the criminal liability. When<lb/> a person accused of land grabbing or abatement<lb/> thereof, is before the Special Court, he would be a<lb/> competent witness for the defence to disprove the<lb/> charges made against him or any person charged<lb/> with him in the criminal proceedings. Of course, an<lb/> accused person before Special Court shall not be<lb/> called as a witness except on his own request in<lb/> writing and failure to give evidence on his behalf<lb/> should not be made the subject of any comment by<lb/> any of the parties and it would not give rise to any<lb/> presumption against himself or any person charged<lb/> together with him at the same proceedings. The<lb/> expression that &quot;additional evidence&quot; if any<lb/> adduced in the civil proceedings shall not be<lb/> considered by the Special Court while determining<lb/> the criminal liability does not synchronise with the<lb/> established rule of evidence. It lacks clarity, being<lb/> vague and it is not possible to gather the intention of<lb/> the legislature by which, it seeks to achieve the object<lb/> of the Act, apart from the said expression being<lb/> arbitrary, it does not appeal to logic and is also<lb/> against rule of best evidence. Hence, we are of the<lb/> considered view that the expression found in sub-<lb/>section (4) of Section 9 namely;<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot; But additional evidence, if any<lb/> adduced in the civil<lb/> proceedings<lb/> shall<lb/> not<lb/> be<lb/> considered by the Special Court<lb/> while determining the criminal<lb/> liability&quot;<lb/> cannot be sustained as it would not only violative of<lb/> Article 21 of the Constitution of India but also on the<lb/> ground of same being vague.<lb/></item>

			<p>72. Hence, the above expression/sentence<lb/> found in sub-section (4) of Section 9 is liable to be<lb/> struck down and accordingly, it is struck down for<lb/> being violative of Article 21 and vagueness. However,<lb/> we make it expressly clear that evidence admitted<lb/> during criminal proceedings is being permitted to be<lb/> made use of while trying civil liability and not vice<lb/> versa for determining the criminal liability and we<lb/> are of the considered view that accordingly, Section<lb/></p>

			<p>9(4) requires to be read down and understood as<lb/> observed herein above.<lb/></p>

			<p>73. Where the term has been used in the Act,<lb/> which per se seems to be without jurisdiction but can<lb/> be read down in order to make it constitutionally<lb/> valid by separating and excluding that part which is<lb/> invalid or by interpreting the word/sentence in such<lb/> a fashion in order to make it constitutionally valid<lb/> and is within the jurisdiction of the legislature which<lb/> passed the said enactment by reading down the<lb/> provision/s of the Act is not impermissible.<lb/> In<lb/> interpreting the provisions of the Act, it is not<lb/> permissible where the plain language of the provision<lb/> gives a clear and unambiguous meaning can be<lb/> interpreted by reading down and presuming certain<lb/> expressions in order to save it from constitutional<lb/> invalidity. In this background, if the expression with<lb/> regard to the admissibility of additional evidence<lb/> adduced in the civil proceedings being prohibited<lb/> from being considered by the Special Court while<lb/> determining the criminal liability is examined, it<lb/> would leave no manner of doubt that the said<lb/> provision is not only vague, arbitrary but also<lb/> ambiguous and the object of the Act which the<lb/> legislature intended to achieve by this provision is to<lb/> insulate a person from preventing the evidence<lb/> tendered in civil proceedings being used in criminal<lb/> proceedings against a person charged for the offence<lb/> punishable under the Act. Therefore, we are of the<lb/> view that the said provision is vague, ambiguous<lb/> and without clarity or substance and cannot be<lb/> sustained. However, the expression found in the<lb/> very same sub-section (4) of Section 9 namely, &quot;The<lb/> evidence admitted in criminal proceedings may be<lb/> made use of while trying the civil liability&quot; is to be<lb/> understood and same is to be read as :<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;The evidence admitted in<lb/> criminal proceedings may be<lb/> made use of while trying the<lb/> civil liability and not vice<lb/> versa.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>However, we make it clear that the State would be at<lb/> liberty to bring in appropriate amendment in this<lb/> regard to iron out the creases pointed out by us<lb/> herein above.<lb/></p>

			<p>74. In support of this proposition, we rely<lb/> upon the judgment of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court<lb/> referred to herein below with benefit:<lb/></p>

			<p>DELHI<lb/> TRANSPORT<lb/> CORPORATION vs D.T.C.MAZDOOR<lb/> CONGRESS (AIR 1991 SC 101 =<lb/> 1990 SCR (SUPL)(1) 142):<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;122. I am conscious that clear<lb/> intention as indicated in a legislation<lb/> cannot be permitted to be defeated by<lb/> means of construction. It has been said<lb/> that if the legislature has manifested a<lb/> clear intention to exercise an unlimited<lb/> power, it is impermissible to read down<lb/> the amplitude of that power so as to<lb/> make it limited. I do not agree.<lb/> Our legislatures are limited by the<lb/> constitutional inhibitions and it is time,<lb/> in my opinion, that we should read their<lb/> Acts and enactments with the attribute<lb/> that they know their limits and could<lb/> not have intended to violate the<lb/> Constitution. It is true that where there<lb/> are clear, unambiguous and positive<lb/> terms in a legislation, the Court should<lb/> be loath to read down. It should proceed<lb/> with a straight-forward method of<lb/> striking down such legislations. But<lb/> where the statute is silent or not<lb/> expressive or inarticulate, the Court<lb/> must read down in the silence of the<lb/> statute and in the inarticulation of its<lb/> provisions, the constitutional inhibitions<lb/> and transmute the major inarticulate<lb/> premise into a reality and read down the<lb/> statute accordingly. It is true perhaps,<lb/> as has been said, that in the history of<lb/> constitutional law, statutes are seldom<lb/> read down to mean what they say and<lb/> intend. It is begging the question. If the<lb/> statutes are seldom read down to mean<lb/> what they say and intend. It is begging<lb/> the question. If the statute does not<lb/> specifically say, in such circumstances,<lb/> as to how do we find the intention to<lb/> transgress the constitutional limitations.<lb/> At least, the relevant provisions of the<lb/> relevant statutes and the<lb/> rules,<lb/> mentioned hereinbefore, are, in my<lb/> opinion, on these points, not expressive<lb/> enough to betray an intention (to)<lb/> transgress constitutional limitations. I<lb/> am afraid that reference to Elliott<lb/> Ashton Welsh, II v. United States, 398<lb/> US 333; 26 L.Ed. 2d 308 is inept in the<lb/> background of the principles we are<lb/> confronted with. The plain thrust of<lb/> legislative enactment has to be found<lb/> out in the inarticulate expressions and<lb/> in the silence of the legislation. In doing<lb/> so, to say what the legislature did not<lb/> specifically say, is not distortion to avert<lb/> any constitutional collision, In the<lb/> language of the relevant provisions with<lb/> which we are confronted, I do not find<lb/> that intention of the legislature (was) to<lb/> flout the constitutional limitations.<lb/></item>

			<item>228. It is thus clear that the<lb/> doctrine of reading down or of recasting<lb/> the statute can be applied in limited<lb/> situations. It is essentially used, firstly,<lb/> for saving a statute from being struck<lb/> down<lb/> on<lb/> account<lb/> of<lb/> its<lb/> unconstitutionality. It is an extension of<lb/> the<lb/> principle<lb/> that<lb/> when<lb/> two<lb/> interpretations are possible --one<lb/> rendering it constitutional and the other<lb/> making it constitutional the former<lb/> should<lb/> be<lb/> preferred.<lb/> The<lb/> unconstitutionality may sprint from<lb/> either<lb/> the<lb/> incompetence<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> legislature to enact the statute or from<lb/> its violation of any of the provisions of<lb/> the Constitution. The second situation<lb/> which summons its aid is where the<lb/> provisions of the statute are vague and<lb/> ambiguous and it is possible to gather<lb/> the intention of the legislature from the<lb/> object of the statute, the context in<lb/> which the provision occurs and the<lb/> purpose for which it is made.<lb/> However, when the provision is cast<lb/> in a definite and unambiguous language<lb/> and its intention is clear, it is not<lb/> permissible either to mend or bend it<lb/> even if such recasting is in accord with<lb/> good reason and conscience. In such<lb/> circumstances, it is not possible for the<lb/> Court to remake the statute. Its only<lb/> duty is to strike it down and leave it to<lb/> the legislature if it so desires, to amend<lb/> it. If the remaking of the statute by the<lb/> courts is to lead to its distortion that<lb/> course is to be scrupulously avoided one<lb/> of the situations further where the<lb/> doctrine can never be called into play<lb/> where the statute requires extensive<lb/> additions and deletions. Not only it is no<lb/> part of the court&apos;s duty to undertake<lb/> such exercise but it is beyond the<lb/> jurisdiction to do so.<lb/></item>

			<item>274. I am, therefore, inclined to<lb/> hold that the courts, though, have no<lb/> power to amend the law by process of<lb/> interpretation, but do have power to<lb/> mend it so as to be in conformity with<lb/> the intendment of the legislature.<lb/> Doctrine of reading down is one of the<lb/> principles of interpretation of statute in<lb/> that process. But when the offending<lb/> language used by the legislature is clear,<lb/> precise and unambiguous, violating the<lb/> relevant provisions in the constitution,<lb/> resort cannot be had to the doctrine of<lb/> reading down to blow life into the void<lb/> law to save it from unconstitutionality or<lb/> to confer jurisdiction on the legislature.<lb/> Similarly, it cannot be taken aid of to<lb/> emasculate the precise, explicit, clear<lb/> and unambiguous language to confer<lb/> xxx for the appellants.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>75. Sub-section (7) of Section 9 speaks about<lb/> the binding nature of the finding given by the Special<lb/> Court with regard to the determination of the title.<lb/> Section 41 of the Evidence Act speaks about<lb/> relevancy of certain judgment in probate etc. Section<lb/> 41 reads as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;41. Relevancy of certain judgments<lb/> in probate, etc., jurisdiction.-A final<lb/> judgment, order or decree of a<lb/> competent Court, in the exercise of<lb/> probate, matrimonial admiralty or<lb/> insolvency jurisdiction which confers<lb/> upon or takes away from any person<lb/> any legal character, or which declares<lb/> any person to be entitled to any such<lb/> character, or to be entitled to any<lb/> specific thing, not as against any<lb/> specified person but absolutely, is<lb/> relevant when the existence of any<lb/> such legal character, or the title of any<lb/> such person to any such thing, is<lb/> relevant.<lb/> Such judgment, order or decree<lb/> is conclusive proof-<lb/>that any legal character, which it<lb/> confers accrued at the time when such<lb/> judgment, order or decree came into<lb/> operation;<lb/> that any legal character, to which<lb/> it declares any such person to be<lb/> entitled, accrued to that person at the<lb/> time when such judgment, order or<lb/> decree declares it to have accrued to<lb/> that person;<lb/> that any legal character which it<lb/> takes away from any such person<lb/> ceased at the time from which such<lb/> judgment, order or decree declared that<lb/> it had ceased or should cease;<lb/> and that anything to which it<lb/> declares any person to be so entitled<lb/> was the property of that person at the<lb/> time from which such judgment, order<lb/> or decree declares that it had been or<lb/> should be his property. &quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>76. The judgments, order or decree of any<lb/> competent Court in exercise of probate, matrimonial,<lb/> admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction which confers<lb/> upon or takes away from any person or legal<lb/> character, or which declares, any person to be<lb/> entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to<lb/> any specific thing, not as against any specified<lb/> person but absolutely would be relevant and such<lb/> judgment/order/decree would be conclusive proof.<lb/> Sub-section (7) of Section 9 of the KLGP Act-2011 is<lb/> almost analogous to Section 41 of the Evidence Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>77. The intention of the legislature is to see<lb/> that if the finding given by the Special Court under<lb/> the Act with regard to title of the land would act as a<lb/> bar in respect of any further litigation between any<lb/> persons. Such a finding binds against the whole<lb/> world which means, it would not be judgment in<lb/> personem but a judgment in rem i.e., binding against<lb/> the whole world for all practical purposes. Keeping in<lb/> mind the laudable object of the Act, such a<lb/> presumption found under sub-section (7) of Section 9<lb/> of the Act cannot be called as ultra vires and onerous<lb/> in any manner.<lb/></p>

			<p>78. Section 9(5)(a) enables the Special Court<lb/> to follow its own procedure while deciding the civil<lb/> liability.<lb/> However, such procedure cannot be<lb/> inconsistent with the provisions of the code of Civil<lb/> Procedure, 1908. Clause (b) of sub-section (5) of<lb/> Section 9 has been substituted whereunder the<lb/> Special Court has been empowered to try the criminal<lb/> liability in a summary manner if it thinks fit.<lb/> However, pre-amendment, the Special Court was<lb/> required to try the matter as a summary trial. The<lb/> defect pointed out by the petitioners during the<lb/> course of the arguments have been rectified by the<lb/> legislature by amending the Act which enables the<lb/> Special Court to try offences under the Act as warant<lb/> case in the interest of justice. Provisions of Cr.P.C.<lb/> being applicable, as already noticed hereinabove<lb/> Section 259 Cr.P.C. would come into play and<lb/> thereby the Special Court would be empowered to<lb/> convert a summons case into a warrant case and try<lb/> the case accordingly. As such the contention raised<lb/> by the petitioners that procedure prescribed for<lb/> summary trial is unconstitutional, cannot be<lb/> accepted. That apart, Section 9 will have to be<lb/> necessarily read in conjunction with Section 10 and<lb/> when so read, it leaves no manner of doubt about the<lb/> applicability of the provisions of Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure to a matter being tried by the Special<lb/> Court, would be a Court of Session for the purposes<lb/> of conducting prosecution and the person conducting<lb/> a prosecution is deemed to be a public prosecutor.<lb/></p>

			<p>79. With regard to the offences under the<lb/> KLGP<lb/> Act-2011,<lb/> the<lb/> minimum<lb/> punishment<lb/> prescribed is one (1) year and maximum punishment<lb/> can extend upto three (3) years along with the fine,<lb/> which can extend upto Rs.25,000/-. Section 13<lb/> would indicate that the offences punishable under<lb/> the Act shall be cognizable and shall be tried by a<lb/> Magistrate of the First Class specially empowered by<lb/> the Government in this behalf by notification in the<lb/> Official Gazette wherever Special Court is not<lb/> constituted. Thus, the jurisdictional Magistrate if<lb/> notified by the Government to try the offence under<lb/> the Act, will have to necessarily try the same as the<lb/> offence is cognizable. However, if the Special Court is<lb/> already constituted under Section 7, Section 10<lb/> mandates that Special Court would be deemed to be<lb/> a Court of Session and the person conducting the<lb/> prosecution to be a public prosecutor for all practical<lb/> purposes as noticed hereinabove. A Special Court<lb/> presided over by a judicial officer of the cadre of<lb/> Sessions Judge has to apply the provisions of a<lb/> warrant trial, if trial with the offences under the<lb/> Prevention of Corruption Act, 1998 or the offences<lb/> under the POCSO Act, 2012.<lb/></p>

			<p>80. However, in the case on hand, Special<lb/> Court is presided over by a person who is or was a<lb/> Judge of the High Court and whenever the benches of<lb/> the Special Court is constituted it would invariably be<lb/> presided a District Judge (serving or retired). In the<lb/> light of provisions of Section 10 and 13 and Section<lb/> 259 of Cr.P.C. read along with Sections 260, 262 and<lb/> 264 and the gravity of the offences of land grabbing<lb/> and consequences flowing from it, it is advisable that<lb/> the procedure to be adopted to try the offence under<lb/> the Act should be a warrant trial and only in<lb/> exceptional circumstances a summary trial. The<lb/> expression &quot;summarily&quot; used in Section 9(5)(b) of<lb/> KLGP Act even post-amendment would not be<lb/> appealing to logic or it would not gel with Section 10<lb/> and 13 and other cognate provisions of other penal<lb/> statutes including the provisions of Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure referred to hereinabove. However, on this<lb/> ground it would not be appropriate to strike down the<lb/> constitutionality of the provision and the creases, if<lb/> any, can be ironed out and it can be read down to<lb/> make the provision effective, workable and to attain<lb/> the object of the Act. Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the<lb/> matter of STATE OF BIHAR AND OTHERS vs.<lb/> BIHAR DISTILLERY AND ORS. reported in (1997) 2<lb/> SCC 453 has referred to the opinion of Lord Denning<lb/> rendered in SEAFORD COURT ESTATES LTD. Vs.<lb/> ASHER reported in (1949) 2 All.E.R. 155 wherein it<lb/> has been held court should not alter the material but<lb/> should iron out the creases. It has been further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;20.<lb/> We may also refer to the<lb/> following perceptive observations in<lb/> the decision of Lord Denning is<lb/> Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;Whenever a statute comes up for<lb/> consideration it must be remembered<lb/> that it is not within human power to<lb/> foresee the manifold sets of facts<lb/> which may arise, and, even if it were,<lb/> it is not possible to provide for them<lb/> in terms free from all ambiguity. The<lb/> English language is not an instrument<lb/> of<lb/> mathematical<lb/> precision.<lb/> Our<lb/> literature would be much the poorer if<lb/> it were. This is where the draftsmen of<lb/> Acts of Parliament have often been<lb/> unfairly criticized. A judge, believing<lb/> himself to be fettered by the supposed<lb/> rule that he must look to the language<lb/> and nothing else, laments that the<lb/> draftsman have not provided for this<lb/> or that, or have been guilty of some or<lb/> other ambiguity. It would certainly<lb/> save the judges trouble if Acts of<lb/> Parliament were drafted with divine<lb/> prescience and perfect clarity. In the<lb/> absence of it, when a defect appears a<lb/> judge cannot simply fold his hands<lb/> and blame the draftsman. He must<lb/> set to work on the constructive task of<lb/> finding the intention of Parliament,<lb/> and he must do this not only from the<lb/> language of the statute, but also from<lb/> a<lb/> consideration<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> social<lb/> conditions which gave rise to it, and of<lb/> the mischief which it was passed to<lb/> remedy,<lb/> and<lb/> then<lb/> he<lb/> must<lb/> supplement the written word so as to<lb/> give `force and life&apos; to the intention of<lb/> the legislature. That was clearly laid<lb/> down by the resolution of the judges<lb/> in Heydon&apos;s case, and it is the safest<lb/> guide today. Good practical advice on<lb/> the subject was given about the same<lb/> time by Plowden. . . . . . Put into<lb/> homely metaphor it is this: A judge<lb/> should ask himself the question: If the<lb/> makers of the Act had themselves<lb/> come across this ruck in the texture<lb/> of<lb/> it,<lb/> how<lb/> would<lb/> they<lb/> have<lb/> straightened it out? He must then do<lb/> as they would have done. A judge<lb/> must not alter the material of which it<lb/> is woven, but he can and should iron<lb/> out the creases.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>81. The Hon&apos;ble Apex court in the case of<lb/> NAMIT SHARMA vs. UNION OF INDIA reported in<lb/> (2013) 1 SCC 745 has held that the courts would<lb/> generally adopt an interpretation which is favourable<lb/> and tilt towards constitutionality of the statute, with<lb/> the aid of the principles like &quot;reading into&quot; and/or<lb/> &quot;reading down&quot; the relevant provisions to make the<lb/> statute workable as opposed to declaring a provision<lb/> unconstitutional. It is further held declaring a law<lb/> unconstitutional is one of the last resorts to be taken<lb/> by the courts and the courts.<lb/> It has also been<lb/> further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;51. Another most significant canon<lb/> of determination of constitutionality<lb/> is that the courts would be reluctant<lb/> to declare a law invalid or ultra vires<lb/> on account of unconstitutionality.<lb/> The<lb/> courts<lb/> would<lb/> accept<lb/> an<lb/> interpretation which would be in<lb/> favour of the constitutionality, than<lb/> an approach which would render the<lb/> law unconstitutional. Declaring the<lb/> law unconstitutional is one of the<lb/> last resorts taken by the courts. The<lb/> courts would preferably put into<lb/> service the principle of &apos;reading<lb/> down&apos; or &apos;reading into&apos; the provision<lb/> to make it effective, workable and<lb/> ensure the attainment of the object<lb/> of the Act. These are the principles<lb/> which clearly emerge from the<lb/> consistent view taken by this court<lb/> in its various pronouncements.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;61. It is a settled principle of law,<lb/> as stated earlier, that courts would<lb/> generally adopt an interpretation<lb/> which is favourable to and tilts<lb/> towards the constitutionality of a<lb/> statute, with the aid of the principles<lb/> like &apos;reading into&apos; and/or &apos;reading<lb/> down&apos; the relevant provisions, as<lb/> opposed to declaring a provision<lb/> unconstitutional. The courts can also<lb/> bridge the gaps that have been left<lb/> by the legislature inadvertently. We<lb/> are of the considered view that both<lb/> these principles have to be applied<lb/> while interpreting Section 12(5). It is<lb/> the application of these principles<lb/> that would render the provision<lb/> constitutional and not opposed to the<lb/> doctrine of equality. Rather the<lb/> application of the provision would<lb/> become more effective.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>82. As held by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in<lb/> NAMIT SHARMA&apos;s case supra, both these principles<lb/> will have to be applied while interpreting Section 2(d)<lb/> r/w Section 22, 9(4) and 9(5)(b) of KLGP Act-2011, as<lb/> the application of the aforesaid principles would<lb/> render the provisions constitutional and not being<lb/> opposed to the doctrine of equality and protection of<lb/> personal liberty as enshrined in Article 14 and 21 of<lb/> the Constitution of India. By reading down these<lb/> provisions in the manner indicated, we are of the<lb/> considered view that application of the provisions of<lb/> the KLGP Act-2011 would become more effective.<lb/> Hence, it would be apt, appropriate and prudent to<lb/> read down Section 9(5)(b) as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;The Special Court may try<lb/> every offence under the Act as<lb/> if it is a warrant case and only<lb/> in exceptional circumstances<lb/> try in a summary manner for<lb/> reasons to be recorded.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>It is needless to state that the legislature would<lb/> be at liberty to bring in appropriate amendment<lb/> keeping in mind the observations made hereinabove.<lb/></p>

			<p>(3) RE: RIGHT OF APPEAL AND REVISION NOT<lb/> BEING AVAILABLE:<lb/></p>

			<p>83. Though it has been vehemently contended<lb/> that right of appeal or revision is not found in the<lb/> KLGP Act-2011, said argument does not hold good, in<lb/> the light of Act 30/2020 having been enacted and<lb/> Section 17-A(1) as noticed herein above provides for<lb/> filing an appeal against final order passed by the<lb/> Special Court determining the civil liability. The High<lb/> Court if satisfied that case involves a substantial<lb/> question of law, it would entertain an appeal and of<lb/> course subject to limitation as provided thereunder.<lb/> Section 17-A(2) provides for filing an appeal against<lb/> an order of acquittal or conviction and same would lie<lb/> to the High Court and High Court is empowered to<lb/> exercise all the powers conferred under Chapter XXIX<lb/> and XXX of Cr.P.C. As such, said contention does<lb/> not hold water and it contention stands rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>(4) RE: REVERSE ONUS CLAUSE OR BURDEN<lb/> OF PROOF:<lb/></p>

			<p>84. Section 11 of the KLGP Act-2011 would<lb/> indicate that where any proceedings under the Act is<lb/> initiated the State has to prima facie prove that such<lb/> land is owned by the Government. Then Special<lb/> Court would presume that person who is alleged to<lb/> have grabbed the land, is a land grabber and the<lb/> burden of proving that such land is not grabbed by<lb/> him or it is not the land belonging to Government,<lb/> said burden would be on such person.<lb/></p>

			<p>85. It is the contention of the learned<lb/> Advocates appearing for the petitioners that Special<lb/> Courts are taking cognizance, despite State having<lb/> failed to discharge the initial burden. It is also<lb/> contended that reverse onus clause as it stands apply<lb/> only to a class of offenders under the Act and<lb/> contend that under Section 2(d) the definition of land<lb/> would also include the land belonging to Wakf or<lb/> Hindu<lb/> Religious<lb/> Institutions<lb/> and<lb/> Charitable<lb/> Endowments and a local authority, a statutory or<lb/> non-statutory body owned control and managed by<lb/> the Government, but the reverse onus clause apply<lb/> only to the land belonging to Government. Thus, the<lb/> reverse onus clause excluding sub-clauses of offences<lb/> created under the Act is arbitrary.<lb/></p>

			<p>86. The extent of right to a fair trial of an<lb/> accused must be determined keeping in mind the<lb/> fundamental rights as adumbrated in Article 21 of<lb/> the Constitution of India as also the International<lb/> Convention and Convenants chartered in human<lb/> rights. Justness and fairness of a trial is also implicit<lb/> in Article 21 of the Constitution of India. A fair trial is<lb/> again a human right. Every action of the authorities<lb/> under the Act must be construed having regard to<lb/> the provisions of the Act as also the right of an<lb/> accused to have a fair trial. We are not oblivious<lb/> that decision<lb/> in NOOR AGA vs STATE OF<lb/> PUNJAB reported in (2008)16 SCC 417 whereunder,<lb/> it came to be held that Sections 35 and 54 of NDPS<lb/> Act, 1985 are not ultra vires of the Constitution of<lb/> India. It was held therein to the following effect:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;23.<lb/> Section 35 of the Act provides<lb/> for presumption of culpable mental<lb/> state.<lb/> It also provides that an<lb/> accused may prove that he had no<lb/> such mental state with respect to the<lb/> act charged as an offence under the<lb/> prosecution. Section 54 of the Act<lb/> places the burden of proof on the<lb/> accused as regards possession of the<lb/> contraband to account for the same<lb/> satisfactorily.<lb/></item>

			<item>34.<lb/> The Act contains draconian<lb/> provisions. It must, however, be borne<lb/> in mind that the Act was enacted<lb/> having regard to the mandate<lb/> contained<lb/> in<lb/> International<lb/> Conventions on Narcotic Drugs and<lb/> Psychotropic<lb/></item>

			<item>Substances.<lb/> Only<lb/> because the burden of proof under<lb/> certain circumstances is placed on the<lb/> accused, the same, by itself, in our<lb/> opinion, would not render the<lb/> impugned<lb/> provisions<lb/> unconstitutional.<lb/></item>

			<item>35.<lb/> A right to be presumed<lb/> innocent, subject to the establishment<lb/> of certain foundational facts and<lb/> burden of proof, to a certain extent,<lb/> can be placed on an accused. It must<lb/> be construed having regard to the<lb/> other international conventions and<lb/> having regard to the fact that it has<lb/> been held to be constitutional. Thus, a<lb/> statute may be constitutional but a<lb/> prosecution thereunder may not be<lb/> held to be one. Indisputably, civil<lb/> liberties and rights of citizens must be<lb/> upheld.<lb/></item>

			<item>60.<lb/> Whether the burden on the<lb/> accused is a legal burden or an<lb/> evidentiary burden would depend on<lb/> the statute in question. The purport<lb/> and object thereof must also be taken<lb/> into consideration in determining the<lb/> said question. It must pass the test of<lb/> doctrine<lb/> of<lb/> proportionality.<lb/> The<lb/> difficulties faced by the prosecution in<lb/> certain cases may be held to be<lb/> sufficient to arrive at an opinion that<lb/> the burden on the accused is an<lb/> evidentiary burden and not merely a<lb/> legal burden. The trial must be fair.<lb/> The accused must be provided with<lb/> opportunities to effectively defend<lb/> himself. In Sheldrake v. Director of<lb/> Public Prosecutions [(2005) 1 All ER<lb/> 237] in the following terms:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;21. From this body of<lb/> authority certain principles<lb/> may be derived. The overriding<lb/> concern is that a trial should<lb/> be fair, and the presumption of<lb/> innocence is a fundamental<lb/> right directed to that end. The<lb/> convention does not outlaw<lb/> presumptions of fact or law<lb/> but requires that these should<lb/> be kept within reasonable<lb/> limits and should not be<lb/> arbitrary. It is open to states to<lb/> define<lb/> the<lb/> constituent<lb/> elements of a criminal offence,<lb/> excluding the requirements of<lb/> mens rea. But the substance<lb/> and effect of any presumption<lb/> adverse to a defendant must<lb/> be examined, and must be<lb/> reasonable. Relevant to any<lb/> judgment on reasonableness or<lb/> proportionality will be the<lb/> opportunity<lb/> given<lb/> to<lb/> the<lb/> defendant<lb/> to<lb/> rebut<lb/> the presumption, maintenance<lb/> of the rights of the defence,<lb/> flexibility in application of the<lb/> presumption, retention by the<lb/> court of a power to assess the<lb/> evidence, the importance of<lb/> what is at stake and the<lb/> difficulty which a prosecutor<lb/> may face in the absence of a<lb/> presumption. Security concerns<lb/> do not absolve member States<lb/> from their duty to observe<lb/> basic standards of fairness.<lb/> The<lb/> justifiability<lb/> of<lb/> any<lb/> infringement<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> presumption<lb/> of<lb/> innocence<lb/> cannot be resolved by any rule<lb/> of thumb, but on examination<lb/> of<lb/> all<lb/> the<lb/> facts<lb/> and<lb/> circumstances of the particular<lb/> provision as applied in the<lb/> particular case.&quot;<lb/> (emphasis added)<lb/></item>

			<item>61. It is, however, interesting to<lb/> note the recent comments on<lb/> Sheldrake (supra) by Richard<lb/> Glover<lb/> in<lb/> an<lb/> Article<lb/> titled<lb/> &quot;Sheldrake Regulatory Offences<lb/> and Reverse Legal Burdens of<lb/> Proof&quot; [(2006) 4 Web JCLI] wherein<lb/> it was stated:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;It is apparent from the<lb/> records in Hansard (implicitly<lb/> if not expressly) that the<lb/> Government was content for a<lb/> legal onus to be on the<lb/> defendant when it drafted the<lb/> Road Traffic Act 1956. An<lb/> amendment to the Bill was<lb/> suggested in the Lords &quot;which<lb/> puts upon the accused the<lb/> onus of showing that he had<lb/> no intention of driving or<lb/> attempting to drive a motor<lb/> vehicle&quot; (Lord Brabazon 1955,<lb/> col 582). Lord Mancroft, for<lb/> the Government, although<lb/> critical of the amendment<lb/> stated: &quot;...the Government<lb/> want to do exactly what he<lb/> wants to do. We have,<lb/> therefore, to try to find some<lb/> means of getting over this<lb/> technical<lb/> difficulty&quot;<lb/> (Lord<lb/> Mancroft 1955, col 586). It is<lb/> submitted that this tends to<lb/> suggest that the Government<lb/> intended a reverse legal<lb/> burden.<lb/></item>

			<item>The reverse legal burden was<lb/> certainly in keeping with the<lb/> tenor of the 1956 Act to &quot;keep<lb/> death off the road&quot; (Lord<lb/> Mancroft 1954, col 637) by<lb/> increased regulation of road<lb/> transport, particularly in the<lb/> light of a sharp increase in<lb/> reported road casualties in<lb/> 1954 -there was an 18 per<lb/> cent increase (Lord Mancroft<lb/> 1954, col 637). The Times lead<lb/> article for 4-7-1955 (at 9d)<lb/> stressed the Bill&apos;s importance<lb/> for Parliament: &quot;They have the<lb/> casualty lists -5,000 or more<lb/> killed on the roads every year,<lb/> 10 times as many killed and<lb/> more than 30 times as many<lb/> slightly hurt&quot;. This was &quot;a<lb/> national scandal&quot;. The Earl of<lb/> Selkirk, who introduced the<lb/> Bill in the Lords, remarked<lb/> that &quot;we require a higher<lb/> standard of discipline on the<lb/> roads&quot; (The Earl of Selkirk<lb/> 1954, col 567) and Lord<lb/> Mancroft<lb/> commented<lb/> specifically in relation to `being<lb/> drunk in charge&apos; that &quot;...we<lb/> should be quite right if we<lb/> erred on the side of strictness&quot;<lb/> (Lord Mancroft 1955, col 586).<lb/></item>

			<item>Notwithstanding<lb/> this<lb/> historical background it was,<lb/> of course, open to their<lb/> Lordships in Sheldrake to<lb/> interpret section 5(2) as only<lb/> imposing<lb/> an<lb/> evidential<lb/> burden on the defendant.<lb/> Lord Bingham referred to the<lb/> courts&apos;<lb/> interpretative<lb/> obligation under the Human<lb/> Rights Act 1998 Section 3 as<lb/> &quot;a very strong and far-<lb/>reaching<lb/> one,<lb/> and<lb/> may<lb/> require the court to depart<lb/> from the legislative intention<lb/> of Parliament&quot; ([2004] UKHL<lb/> 43, para 28). However, he<lb/> must also have had in mind<lb/> further dicta from the recent<lb/> judgment in Ghaidan v Godin-<lb/>Mendoza (WLR. P.121, para<lb/> 19):<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;19….Parliament<lb/> is<lb/> charged with the primary<lb/> responsibility for deciding the<lb/> best way of dealing with social<lb/> problems. The court&apos;s role is<lb/> one of review. The court will<lb/> reach a different conclusion<lb/> from the legislature only when<lb/> it is apparent that the<lb/> legislature<lb/> has<lb/> attached<lb/> insufficient importance to a<lb/> person&apos;s Convention rights&quot;<lb/> (Lord Nicholls, [2004] UKHL<lb/> 30,<lb/> para<lb/> 19.<lb/> Also<lb/> see<lb/> Johnstone [2003] UKHL 28,<lb/> para 51).<lb/></item>

			<item>That is, the Courts should<lb/> generally<lb/> defer<lb/> (11)<lb/> to<lb/> the<lb/> Legislature or, at least, allow them<lb/> a discretionary area of judgment (R<lb/> v DPP, ex p Kebilene [1999] UKHL<lb/> 43; AC pp.380-81). (Lord Hoffman<lb/> has criticised the use of the term<lb/> `deference&apos;<lb/> because<lb/> of<lb/> its<lb/> &quot;overtones of servility, or perhaps<lb/> gratuitous concession&quot; (R ProLife<lb/> Alliance v BBC [2003] UKHL 23,<lb/> paras 75-762; WLR 1403, 1422.)<lb/> This principle now appears firmly<lb/> established, as is evident from the<lb/> decision of an enlarged Privy<lb/> Council sitting in Attorney-General<lb/> for Jersey v Holley [2005] UKPC<lb/></item>

			<item>23. Lord Nicholls, who again<lb/> delivered the majority judgment (6-<lb/>3), stated: (WLR p.37, para 22)<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;22…..The law of homicide<lb/> is a highly sensitive and<lb/> highly controversial area of<lb/> the criminal law. In 1957<lb/> Parliament<lb/> altered<lb/> the<lb/> common law relating to<lb/> provocation and declared<lb/> what the law on this subject<lb/> should thenceforth be. In<lb/> these circumstances it is<lb/> not open to judges now to<lb/> change<lb/> (`develop&apos;)<lb/> the<lb/> common law and thereby<lb/> depart from the law as<lb/> declared by Parliament.&quot;<lb/> Parliament&apos;s intentions also appear to<lb/> have been of particular importance in<lb/> the recent case Makuwa [2006]<lb/> EWCA<lb/> Crim 175 (CA),<lb/> which<lb/> concerned the application of the<lb/> statutory defence provided by the<lb/> Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.<lb/> Section 31(1) to an offence under the<lb/> Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981,<lb/> Section 3 of using a false instrument.<lb/> The question was whether there was<lb/> an onus on a refugee to prove that he<lb/> (a) presented himself without delay to<lb/> the authorities; (b) showed good<lb/> cause for his illegal entry and (c)<lb/> made an asylum claim as soon as<lb/> was reasonably practicable. Moore-<lb/>Bick L.J&apos;s judgment was, with<lb/> respect,<lb/> rather<lb/> confused.<lb/> He<lb/> appeared<lb/> to<lb/> approve<lb/> gravamen<lb/> analysis when he stated that the<lb/> presumption<lb/> of<lb/> innocence<lb/> was<lb/> engaged by a reverse burden (paras<lb/> 28 and 36). However, he then stated<lb/> that the statutory defence did not<lb/> impose on the defendant the burden<lb/> of disproving an essential ingredient<lb/> of the offence (para 32), in which case<lb/> it is clear that the presumption of<lb/> innocence<lb/> was<lb/> not<lb/> engaged.<lb/> Nonetheless, he did, at least,<lb/> recognise the limits of gravamen<lb/> analysis,<lb/> which<lb/> was<lb/> clearly<lb/> inapplicable to sections 3 and 31 as<lb/> the statutory defence applied to a<lb/> number of other offences under the<lb/> same<lb/> Act<lb/> and<lb/> the Immigration<lb/> Act 1971 (para 32). His Lordship<lb/> acknowledged<lb/> that<lb/> particular<lb/> attention<lb/> should<lb/> be<lb/> paid<lb/> to<lb/> Parliament&apos;s actual intentions (para<lb/> 33), as had been the case in<lb/> Sheldrake.<lb/></item>

			<item>In light of the above it is submitted<lb/> that their Lordships in Sheldrake, as<lb/> in Brown v Stott [2000] UKPC D3<lb/> (PC); [2003] 1 AC 681, were entitled<lb/> to uphold a legal rather than an<lb/> evidential burden on the defendant<lb/> and to take into account other<lb/> Convention rights, namely the right<lb/> to life of members of the public<lb/> exposed to the increased danger of<lb/> accidents<lb/> from<lb/> unfit<lb/> drivers<lb/> (European Convention on Human<lb/> Rights<lb/> and<lb/> Fundamental<lb/> Freedoms, Article 2). That is, there<lb/> were sound policy reasons for<lb/> imposing<lb/> a<lb/> reverse<lb/> legal<lb/> burden, which will be the subject of<lb/> further discussion in the second part<lb/> to this article.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>80.<lb/> The constitutional mandate<lb/> of equality of law and equal<lb/> protection of law as adumbrated<lb/> under Article 14 of the Constitution<lb/> of India cannot be lost sight of. The<lb/> courts, it is well settled, would avoid<lb/> a construction which would attract<lb/> the wrath of Article 14. It also cannot<lb/> be oblivious of the law that the Act is<lb/> complete code in itself and, thus, the<lb/> provisions of the 1962 Act cannot be<lb/> applied<lb/> to<lb/> seek<lb/> conviction<lb/> thereunder.<lb/></p>

			<p>114.<lb/> Article 12 of the Universal<lb/> Declaration<lb/> of<lb/> Human<lb/> Rights<lb/> provides for the right to a fair trial.<lb/> Such rights are enshrined in our<lb/> Constitutional Scheme being Article<lb/> 21 of the Constitution of India. If an<lb/> accused has a right of fair trial, his<lb/> case must be examined keeping in<lb/> view the ordinary law of the land.<lb/></p>

			<item>115.<lb/> It is one thing to say that<lb/> even<lb/> applying<lb/> the<lb/> well-known<lb/> principles of law, they are found to be<lb/> guilty of commission of offences for<lb/> which they are charged but it is<lb/> another thing to say that although<lb/> they cannot be held guilty on the<lb/> basis of the materials on record, they<lb/> must suffer punishment in view of<lb/> the past experience or otherwise.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>87. In many special statutes dealing with<lb/> penal offences, reverse burden is contemplated. On a<lb/> plain reading of Section 11 of KLGP Act-2011 it<lb/> would clearly indicate that the initial burden is cast<lb/> upon the applicant and unless said burden is<lb/> effectively discharged with regard to the title of the<lb/> land owned by the Government, the onus does not<lb/> shift to the other side. In other words, the onus will<lb/> be on the alleged land grabber to prove that he has<lb/> not grabbed the Government land, only after the<lb/> applicant prima facie proves that land is owned by<lb/> the Government. In order to attract the provisions of<lb/> Section 11, the applicant is expected to initially prove<lb/> that land is owned by the Government. This is a<lb/> rebuttable presumption, which is equivalent to the<lb/> presumption found in Section 118 of the Negotiable<lb/> Instruments Act r/w Section 138. Therefore, the<lb/> provisions of Section 11 cannot be construed as<lb/> onerous.<lb/> That apart, the applicant will have to<lb/> introduce evidence both oral as well as documentary,<lb/> to prima facie prove that the land is owned by the<lb/> Government. Hence, Section 11 would be a tool<lb/> available to the Special Court and within the domain<lb/> of assessment of the evidence.<lb/></p>

			<p>88. Some of the offences are defined in such a<lb/> way that presumption is to prove certain facts<lb/> relatable to the offence and then a defence has to<lb/> bear the burden of exculpation.<lb/> The legislative<lb/> bodies have realised the need of making provisions<lb/> for statutory presumption in the specific legislations.<lb/> The Centre and State Acts have made provisions for<lb/> &quot;statutory presumption&quot; of the guilt of the accused<lb/> and some of the legislations which provide for such<lb/> statutory presumptions are as under:<lb/> Sl.No. Name of the Act<lb/> Sections<lb/> providing<lb/> &quot;Statutory<lb/> Presumptions&quot;<lb/> under<lb/> the Act<lb/> 1<lb/> Indian Evidence Act,<lb/> 1872<lb/> S.113 -B, 106, 9<lb/> S.113 -A, 114 A<lb/> S.3 (Proved)<lb/> S.101 -117<lb/> 2<lb/> Indian Penal Code<lb/> S.304 B, 498A S.304 I &amp;<lb/> II<lb/> S. 304 A, 304 B<lb/> S. 306<lb/> 3<lb/> Juvenile Justice Act<lb/> S. 49<lb/> 4<lb/> Juvenile Justice Care<lb/> and Protection of<lb/> Children Rules 2007<lb/></p>

			<p>R. 12<lb/> R.12 (3), (9), (I) -(III)<lb/> 5<lb/> NDPS<lb/> S.37, 35, 54, 60(3)<lb/> S.80, 8-10, 2 (XIV)<lb/> S.25, 35 r/w 54, 53-A<lb/> 6<lb/> Cr.P.C<lb/> S.303, 228, 128(1)<lb/> 7<lb/> Prevention of<lb/> Corruption Act<lb/> S.20, 7<lb/> 8<lb/> TADA, 1987<lb/> S.21 (2)<lb/></p>

			<p>9<lb/> Prevention of Money<lb/> Laundering<lb/> S.22, 24, 23 S.3 &amp; 4<lb/> 10<lb/> Unlawful Activities<lb/> 1967<lb/></p>

			<p>S.17, 18, 10<lb/> 11<lb/> Negotiable<lb/> Instruments Act<lb/> S.118(a), 139<lb/> 12<lb/> General Clauses Act<lb/> S.27<lb/> 13<lb/> Wildlife Protection Act,<lb/> 1972<lb/> S.69<lb/> 14<lb/> Income Tax Act<lb/> S.271 (I) C Exp. 1<lb/></p>

			<p>89. Noticeably, the statutory presumptions<lb/> incorporated in law or those which deal with offences<lb/> impacting upon public morality, health, security and<lb/> discipline. The statutory presumptions have thus<lb/> been selectively applied depending upon the changing<lb/> scenario, and the strategy of those crimes, committed<lb/> either in secrecy or with the aid of sophisticated and<lb/> advanced scientific and technical devices, denying<lb/> access to any evidence/clue to the perpetration<lb/> thereof. Another factor is, impossibility of collecting<lb/> evidence of said crimes depending on the modus<lb/> operandi, absence/disinclination of witnesses to<lb/> depose for variety of reasons, which often result in<lb/> exoneration from guilt, gross injustice which though<lb/> apparent, goes unremedied.<lb/></p>

			<p>90. The object and reasons of two third of<lb/> such laws which incorporate statutory presumption<lb/> of culpability would reveal the compulsion of<lb/> maintenance of a discipline in social order, for this<lb/> shift from the stand point of presumption of<lb/> innocence to that of guilt in a limited way.<lb/></p>

			<p>91. Presumption,<lb/> if<lb/> taken,<lb/> is<lb/> always<lb/> rebuttable and arises on the proof of certain basic<lb/> facts relevant to the offence, whereupon the onus<lb/> shifts to the accused to rebut the presumption of<lb/> guilt. Thus, this apportionment of the obligation in<lb/> quest of justice, having regard to the overall demand<lb/> of an orderly law abiding social set up, governed by<lb/> the rule of law is an exception to the starting premise<lb/> of innocence of accused, the otherwise overwhelming<lb/> and the supervening fundamental precept of criminal<lb/> jurisprudence.<lb/></p>

			<p>92. Though it is the cardinal principle of<lb/> criminal jurisprudence that burden of proof of an<lb/> offence would always lie on the prosecution,<lb/> exceptions have also been provided in Sections 105<lb/> and 106 of the Evidence Act. Section 105 says that if<lb/> a person is accused of an offence, the burden of<lb/> proving the existence of circumstances, bringing the<lb/> case within all the general exemptions in the Indian<lb/> Penal Code or within any special exception or proviso<lb/> contained in any other law defining the offence, is<lb/> upon him and the Court shall presume the absence<lb/> of such circumstances.<lb/></p>

			<p>93. Though law has given sanction of<lb/> presumption of innocence until guilt is declared by a<lb/> Court of law in certain cases including the cases say,<lb/> relating to Preventing of Corruption Act, placing the<lb/> burden of proof on the accused in reasonable and not<lb/> unjust, or unfair nor is to be regarded as violative of<lb/> Article 21 of the Constitution of India as propagated<lb/> in VEERASAMI VS. UNION OF INDIA reported in<lb/> (1991) 3 SCC 655.<lb/></p>

			<p>94. In STATE vs HAREMZA reported in 213<lb/> Kan.201 (Kan.1973) this Court has observed:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Statutory presumptions are<lb/> ordinarily rebuttable. A rebuttable<lb/> statutory presumption governs<lb/> only the burden of going forward<lb/> with the evidence and, even when<lb/> it operates against the defendant,<lb/> it does not alter the ultimate<lb/> burden of proof resting upon the<lb/> prosecution,<lb/> nor<lb/> deprive<lb/> the<lb/> defendant of the benefit of the<lb/> presumption of innocence.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>95. Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the matter of<lb/> V.LAXMINARASAMMA vs A YADAIAH (DEAD) AND<lb/> OTHERS reported in (2009)5 SCC 478 has held that<lb/> only because the burden of proof is on the noticee,<lb/> the same would not mean that he has been deprived<lb/> of his right to defend in the proceedings. It is further<lb/> held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;36. Only because the burden xxx<lb/> proceedings. Burden of proof is in<lb/> the realm of procedural law. By<lb/> reason of such a provision,<lb/> substantive right of the parties on<lb/> an immovable property is not<lb/> taken away.<lb/> Jurisdiction is<lb/> exercised by the Tribunal and/or<lb/> Special Court upon arriving at a<lb/> satisfaction in regard to existence<lb/> of jurisdictional fact.<lb/></item>

			<p>96. Nevertheless, it has been judicially<lb/> observed that the presumption of innocence needs<lb/> effective modifications. A right to keep silent does no<lb/> more give privilege to tell lies and take up false<lb/> defence. In PERSHADILAL VS. STATE OF U.P.<lb/> reported in AIR 1957 SCC 211 while construing<lb/> Section 114 of the Evidence Act, 1872, the Supreme<lb/> Court observed, that where in a murder charge, the<lb/> accused falsely denied several relevant acts which<lb/> have been conclusively established, the court would<lb/> be justified in drawing an adverse inference from this<lb/> against the accused. The limits on the privilege of an<lb/> accused person not to open his mouth has further<lb/> been explained in DEONANADAN MISHRA vs.<lb/> STATE OF BIHAR reported in AIR 1955 SC 801. In<lb/> this case the appellant accused was charged with<lb/> murder and was convicted on the basis of only<lb/> circumstantial evidence which pointed the accused<lb/> as the assailant with reasonable definiteness as<lb/> regards time and situation for which the accused did<lb/> not offer an explanation.<lb/> The absence of any<lb/> explanation or false explanations was treated as an<lb/> additional link in the chain of circumstances which<lb/> went against the accused. In M.G. AGARWAL vs.<lb/> STATE OF MAHARASHTRA reported in AIR 1963<lb/> SCC 200, the Apex Court has held that a conviction<lb/> can be reasonably founded on circumstantial<lb/> evidence and an inference of guilt can be drawn if the<lb/> proved facts are wholly inconsistent with the<lb/> innocence of the accused and are consistent with his<lb/> guilt. In the case of ANDHRA PRADESH vs. I B S<lb/> PRASAD RAO reported in 1970 Crl.LJ SC 733 the<lb/> Supreme Court has gone a step further in holding<lb/> that even if one or more of the circumstances in the<lb/> chain of circumstantial evidence in inconsistent with<lb/> the guilt, but the combined effect of the facts is<lb/> conclusive of the guilt, a conviction will be justified.<lb/></p>

			<p>97. It has been held by Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in<lb/> SEEMA SILK SAREES AND ANOTHER vs<lb/> DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT AND OTHERS<lb/> reported in (2008)5 SCC 580 that a provision in an<lb/> enactment would not become unconstitutional only<lb/> because it provides for a reverse burden. It has also<lb/> been held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;19. A legal provision does not<lb/> become<lb/> unconstitutional<lb/> only<lb/> because it provides for a reverse<lb/> burden. The question as regards<lb/> burden of proof is procedural in<lb/> nature. [See Hiten P. Dalal v.<lb/> Bratindranath Banerjee, (2001) 6<lb/> SCC 16 and M.S. Narayana Menon<lb/> v. State of Kerala, (2006) 6 SCC<lb/> 39].<lb/></item>

			<item>20, The<lb/> presumption<lb/> raised<lb/> against the trader is a rebuttable<lb/> one. Reverse burden as also<lb/> statutory presumptions can be<lb/> raised in several statutes as, for<lb/> example,<lb/> the Negotiable<lb/> Instruments<lb/> Act, Prevention<lb/> of<lb/> Corruption<lb/> Act,<lb/> TADA,<lb/> etc.<lb/> Presumption is raised only when<lb/> certain foundational facts are<lb/> established by the prosecution.<lb/> The accused in such an event<lb/> would be entitled to show that he<lb/> has not violated the provisions of<lb/> the Act. In a case of this nature,<lb/> particularly, when an appeal<lb/> against the order of the Tribunal is<lb/> pending, we do not think that the<lb/> appellants are entitled to take the<lb/> benefit thereof at this stage. Such<lb/> contentions must be raised before<lb/> the criminal court.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>98. There is a danger to the excessive<lb/> devotion to the rule or presumption of innocence and<lb/> to the soothing sentiment that all acquittals are<lb/> always good regardless of justice to the victim and<lb/> the community. In the context of escalating crime,<lb/> the doctrine that it is better that ten guilty men<lb/> should escape than one innocent may be convicted is<lb/> a false dilemma.<lb/> In this context the following<lb/> observations of Justice Krishna Iyer, who has been a<lb/> strong supporter of Human Rights of accused, made<lb/> in the case of SHIVAJI SAHEBRAO BABADE vs.<lb/> STATE OF MAHARASHTRA reported in AIR 1973<lb/> SC 2622, warn against the excessive reliance on the<lb/> presumption of innocence. It has been held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;The cherished principle or golden<lb/> thread of proof beyond reasonable<lb/> doubt which runs through the web of<lb/> our law should not be stretched<lb/> morbidly to enhance every hunch,<lb/> hesitancy and degree of doubt. The<lb/> excessive solicitude reflected in the<lb/> attitude that let a thousand guilty<lb/> men go out but one innocent martyr<lb/> shall not suffer, is a false dilemma.<lb/> Only reasonable doubt belongs to the<lb/> accused. Otherwise, any practical<lb/> system of justice will then break<lb/> down and lose credibility with the<lb/> community. However, in Kali Ram<lb/> vs. State of H.P. the Supreme Court<lb/> reemphasized the importance of the<lb/> principle<lb/> of<lb/> presumption<lb/> of<lb/> innocence and observed that &quot;It is no<lb/> doubt that wrongly acquittals are<lb/> undesirable<lb/> and<lb/> shake<lb/> the<lb/> confidence of the people in the<lb/> judicial system; much worse, is,<lb/> however, the wrongly conviction of<lb/> an<lb/> innocent<lb/> person.<lb/> The<lb/> consequences of the conviction of an<lb/> innocent person are far more serious<lb/> and its reverberations cannot but be<lb/> felt in a civilized society.<lb/></item>

			<p>99. While discussing all these issues we,<lb/> however, should not remain unmindful of the fact<lb/> that standard of proof to uphold the guilt of the<lb/> accused in today&apos;s societal structure is often very<lb/> difficult to achieve in all types of cases since in the<lb/> current scenario, the unwillingness, non-availability<lb/> of witnesses to come forward to tell the truth, huge<lb/> dockets of cases in the courts of law, procedural<lb/> prolixity leading to procrastination of trial are some of<lb/> the serious impediments.<lb/> Therefore, a measure<lb/> reform in the approach of accepting and using<lb/> presumptive laws engrafted in the statures is<lb/> necessary, in a more liberal way, which will not<lb/> otherwise be an affront to the constitutional<lb/> guarantee of right to life and liberty.<lb/></p>

			<p>100. In the light of the clear words found in<lb/> Section 11 of the Act and in the light of the law<lb/> enunciated by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court with<lb/> regard to the insertion of reverse burden in certain<lb/> penal statutes, such a presumption is not violative of<lb/> Article 20(3) or 21 of the Constitution of India.<lb/> Hence, it is to be held that Section 11 is intra<lb/> vires of Constitution and consequently it is held<lb/> to be valid.<lb/></p>

			<p>(5) RE: KLGP ACT-2011 PROVIDES FOR<lb/> CRIMINAL TRIAL BEFORE THE SPECIAL COURT<lb/> TO BE SUMMARY TRIAL, WHEREAS PUNISHMENT<lb/> TO BE IMPOSED UNDER SECTION 4 OF THE ACT<lb/> BEING NOT LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND WHICH<lb/> MAY EXTEND TO THREE YEARS WOULD BE<lb/> CONTRARY TO SECTION 262 OF CR.P.C.<lb/></p>

			<p>101. Pre-amendment Section 9(5)(b) of the Act<lb/> prescribed that every offence punishable under this<lb/> Act is to be tried summarily.<lb/></p>

			<p>102. The vires of Section 9(5) is also sought to<lb/> be attacked on the ground of the KLGP Act-2011<lb/> provides for offence punishable under the Act to be<lb/> tried summarily vide clause (b) and Section 260(1)(i)<lb/> of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that<lb/> summary trial is applicable only in respect of offences<lb/> not punishable with death, life imprisonment or<lb/> imprisonment for a term exceeding two years. It is<lb/> contended that Section 4(3) and Section 5 of the Act<lb/> provides for imprisonment for the offence under the<lb/> KLGP Act-2011 can be up to three years and<lb/> therefore, the said provision is manifestly arbitrary.<lb/> It is further contended that Section 10 of the Act<lb/> states that provisions of Cr.P.C. will apply to the<lb/> extent that it is not inconsistent with the Act and<lb/> there being inconsistency between the Act and the<lb/> Code regarding applicability of the procedure for<lb/> summary trial and procedure prescribed under the<lb/> Code for summary trial would not apply to the trial<lb/> under the KLGP Act-2011 and therefore, the<lb/> provision is manifestly arbitrary.<lb/></p>

			<p>103. The Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in SHAYARA<lb/> BANO vs UNION OF INDIA reported in (2017)9 SCC<lb/> 1 has held that the test of manifest arbitrariness can<lb/> be ascertained by examining as to whether the<lb/> legislature capriciously, irrationally and/or without<lb/> adequacy has legislated. It has been further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;101.<lb/> ……Manifest arbitrariness,<lb/> therefore, must be something done<lb/> by<lb/> the<lb/> legislature<lb/> capriciously,<lb/> irrationally and/or without adequate<lb/> determining principle.<lb/> Also, when<lb/> something is done which is excessive<lb/> and<lb/> disproportionate,<lb/> such<lb/> legislation would be manifestly<lb/> arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the<lb/> view that arbitrariness in the sense of<lb/> manifest arbitrariness as pointed out<lb/> by us above would apply to negate<lb/> legislation as well under Article 14.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>104. In this background, Section 9(5)(b) of the<lb/> KLGP Act-2011 when perused, it would indicate that<lb/> pre-amendment , the only option that was available<lb/> to the Special Court was to<lb/> try the offence<lb/> punishable under the Act summarily. However, post-<lb/>amendment by Act 30/2020, clause (b) of sub-section<lb/> (5) of Section 9 enables the Special Court to try the<lb/> proceedings in a summary manner if it thinks fit and<lb/> if it appears to the Special Court that the offence<lb/> should be tried in accordance with the procedure for<lb/> trial of warrant cases, it may proceed to re-hear the<lb/> case in the manner provided by Code of Civil<lb/> Procedure for the trial of warrant cases and it is<lb/> empowered to recall the witness who may have been<lb/> examined. It would be necessary to extract the<lb/> substituted provision of Section 9(5)(b) at the cost of<lb/> repetition and it reads:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;(b) the Special Court may, if it<lb/> thinks fit, try in a summary manner<lb/> any offence under this Act:<lb/></item>

			<item>Provided that, if the Special<lb/> Court is of the opinion that there are<lb/> no sufficient grounds for proceding,<lb/> the Court shall dismiss the complaint<lb/> or drop further proceedings and in<lb/> every such case it shall briefly record<lb/> reasons.<lb/></item>

			<item>Provided further that, the<lb/> course of the trial of summons case<lb/> relating to an offence under this Act,<lb/> it appears to the Special Court that<lb/> in the interests of justice, the offence<lb/> shall be tried in accordance with the<lb/> procedure for trial of warrant cases,<lb/> the Special Court may proceed to re-<lb/>hear the case in the manner provided<lb/> by the Code of Criminal Procedure,<lb/> 1973 (Central Act 2 of 1974) for the<lb/> trial of warrant-cases and may recall<lb/> any witness who may have been<lb/> examined.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>105. Section 260 in Chapter XXI of Cr.P.C.<lb/> speaks about the power to try an offence summarily.<lb/> Since Section 262 and 264 of Cr.P.C. being relevant<lb/> for the case on hand, same is extracted herein below:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;262. Procedure for summary<lb/> trials.-(1)<lb/> In trials under this<lb/> Chapter, the procedure specified in<lb/> this Code for the trial of summons-<lb/>case shall be followed except as<lb/> hereinafter mentioned.<lb/></item>

			<item>(2)<lb/> No sentence of imprisonment<lb/> for a term exceeding three months<lb/> shall be passed in the case of any<lb/> conviction under this Chapter.<lb/></item>

			<item>264. Judgment in cases tried<lb/> summarily.-In every case tried<lb/> summarily in which the accused does<lb/> not plead guilty, the Magistrate shall<lb/> record the substance of the evidence<lb/> and a judgment containing a brief<lb/> statement of the reasons for the<lb/> finding.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>106. Sub-section (2) of Section 260 enables the<lb/> court trying an offence summarily to convert the case<lb/> into a warrant case if it appears to the Magistrate<lb/> that the nature of the case is such that it is<lb/> undesirable to try the case summarily. Likewise,<lb/> Section 259 Cr.P.C. enables the Magistrate dealing<lb/> with the summons case in which the punishment<lb/> exceeds six months and it appears to the Magistrate,<lb/> that in the interest of justice, the offence should be<lb/> tried in accordance with the procedure for trial of<lb/> warrant case, he may proceed to re-hear the case in<lb/> the manner provided in Cr.P.C. for the trial of<lb/> warrant cases.<lb/></p>

			<p>107. Insofar as the offences punishable under<lb/> the KLGP Act-2011, the minimum punishment<lb/> contemplated under Section 4 and 5 is one year and<lb/> the maximum punishment can extend up to three<lb/> years along with fine, which may extend up to<lb/> Rs.25,000/-. AT this juncture, it would be apt to<lb/> notice that if the Special Court is not yet constituted<lb/> to try the offence of land grabbing as per the<lb/> provisions of the KLGP Act-2011, the Magistrate of<lb/> the First Class so empowered by the Government in<lb/> this behalf by notification in the Official Gazette,<lb/> would be empowered to try the same as the offence is<lb/> cognizable. However, where the Special Court is<lb/> already constituted under Section 7, then, Section 10<lb/> of the KLGP Act-2011 mandates that Special Court<lb/> shall be deemed to be the court of Session and the<lb/> person conducting the prosecution will be a Public<lb/> Prosecutor for all practical purposes.<lb/></p>

			<p>108. The High Court of Mumbai in the matter<lb/> of A.G.SAWANT vs SANJAY D. BERDE reported in<lb/> 2013 SCC ONLINE BOM 833 has held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;15. We are unable to accept<lb/> this contention for more than one<lb/> reason. It is too well settled to require<lb/> any reiteration that there is no vested<lb/> right in a procedure. A procedural<lb/> provision, therefore, confers no right<lb/> and of such a character as would<lb/> enable the litigant to insist that his<lb/> case or trial would be governed by<lb/> that procedure alone. It is open for the<lb/> legislature to provide that the entire<lb/> Code of Criminal Procedure or some of<lb/> its provisions would not apply to a<lb/> particular trial. Such a provision does<lb/> not militate against the constitutional<lb/> mandate<lb/> of<lb/> equality,<lb/> fairness,<lb/> reasonableness<lb/> and<lb/> non-<lb/>arbitrariness. Such a provision,<lb/> therefore, cannot be termed as<lb/> discriminatory. In this behalf a useful<lb/> reference can be made to the<lb/> Judgment of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme<lb/> Court in the case of State (Union of<lb/> India) vs. Ram Saran, reported in AIR<lb/> 2004 SC 481.<lb/></item>

			<p>16. Once the law is that no one<lb/> can claim a vested right in matters of<lb/> procedure, then, the very foundation<lb/> of the arguments of Mr. Kadam on<lb/> absence of a provision enabling<lb/> seeking of a discharge in proceedings<lb/> under Section<lb/> 27 must<lb/> fail. The<lb/> Act has provided enough safeguards<lb/> and inbuilt checks. Since the<lb/> provision<lb/> enables<lb/> imposition<lb/> of<lb/> penalties in the form of imprisonment<lb/> and fine and which are termed as<lb/> punishments by Section 53 of IPC, the<lb/> legislature has ensured that there<lb/> would be a trial following which only<lb/> such penalties can be imposed. Once<lb/> a trial has to be held and the powers<lb/> of a Magistrate under the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure to hold such<lb/> trials, is conferred in the Forums and<lb/> Commissions, under the Act, then<lb/> there is no room for any complaint.<lb/> Further, considering the intent of the<lb/> legislature and mandate flowing from<lb/> the Act, the trial is not elaborate<lb/> or lengthy. That the trial is of a<lb/> summary nature by itself and without<lb/> anything more does not mean that the<lb/> provision is<lb/> unconstitutional or<lb/> ultravires as contended.&quot;<lb/> We are in complete agreement with above<lb/> observations made by their Lordships and do not find<lb/> any good ground to deviate from said proposition, as<lb/> it is based on sound principles of law as enunciated<lb/> by Hon&apos;ble Apex Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>109.<lb/> A harmonious reading of substituted<lb/> clause (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 9 with Section<lb/> 10 of the KLGP Act-2011 would clearly indicate that<lb/> though the word &quot;summary&quot; has been used in clause<lb/> (b), an overriding effect has been provided under<lb/> Section 10 empowering the Special Court to be a<lb/> court of Session and the Code of Civil Procedure<lb/> being made applicable. In a given case, if the Special<lb/> Court were to arrive at a conclusion that it would not<lb/> be a fit case for being tried summarily, it would be<lb/> empowered to exercise the power vested under<lb/> Section 259 Cr.P.C. to convert a summons case into<lb/> a warrant case. Thus, harmonious reading of these<lb/> two provisions would leave no manner of doubt to<lb/> negative the contention raised by the petitioners and<lb/> to hold that the apprehension expressed by the<lb/> petitioners is without merit and same is liable to be<lb/> rejected. Hence, the contention raised in that<lb/> regard stands rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>(6) RE: SECTION 9 OF KLGP ACT-2011 IS HIT<lb/> BY ARTICLES 14 AND 21 OF THE CONSTITUTION<lb/> OF INDIA AS PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED IS<lb/> UNWORKABLE:<lb/></p>

			<p>110. The procedural powers of the Special<lb/> Court are contained in Section 9.<lb/> What is of<lb/> significance is that the Special Courts unlike the<lb/> Special Courts established under many enactments<lb/> not only deals with civil cases, but also criminal<lb/> cases. In fact, Section 10 of the KLGP Act-2011<lb/> specifically says that the provisions of CPC and<lb/> Cr.P.C. to the extent they are not inconsistent with<lb/> the provisions of the Act apply to the proceedings<lb/> under the Act. Section 10 further provides that the<lb/> Special Court is deemed to be a civil court or a court<lb/> of session as the case may be and person conducting<lb/> a prosecution before Special Court to be deemed to<lb/> be a Public Prosecutor.<lb/></p>

			<p>111. Yet another argument which has been<lb/> canvassed is that unguided power would result in<lb/> misuse or abuse of the provisions of the Act and as<lb/> such, it would be vice of arbitrariness and hit by<lb/> Article 14 of the Constitution of India and as such,<lb/> sub-section (1) of Section 9 is liable to be quashed is<lb/> an attractive argument to be brushed aside,<lb/> inasmuch as, the said issue being no more res<lb/> integra in the light of law laid down by the Hon&apos;ble<lb/> Apex Court in the case of SANJAY DUTT vs STATE<lb/> Reported in (1994) 5 SCC 410, whereunder it has<lb/> been held that mere possibility of abuse of a<lb/> provision would not affect its constitutionality. It has<lb/> been further held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;15. It is the duty of courts to accept<lb/> a construction which promotes the<lb/> object of the legislation and also<lb/> prevents its possible abuse even<lb/> though the mere possibility of abuse<lb/> of a provision does not affect its<lb/> constitutionality or construction.<lb/> Abuse has to be checked by constant<lb/> vigilance<lb/> and<lb/> monitoring<lb/> of<lb/> individual cases and this can be<lb/> done by screening of the cases by a<lb/> suitable machinery at a high level. It<lb/> is reported that in some States, after<lb/> the decision of this Court in Kartar<lb/> Singh,<lb/> high-powered<lb/> committees<lb/> have been constituted for screening<lb/> all such cases. It is hoped that this<lb/> action will be taken in all the States<lb/> throughout the country. Persons<lb/> aware of instances of abuse,<lb/> including the National Human Rights<lb/> Commission, can assist by reporting<lb/> such instances with particulars to<lb/> that machinery for prompt and<lb/> effective cure. However, that is no<lb/> reason, in law, to doubt its<lb/> constitutionality or to alter the<lb/> proper construction when there is a<lb/> felt need by Parliament for enacting<lb/> such a law to cope with, and prevent<lb/> terrorist and disruptive activities<lb/> threatening the unity and integrity of<lb/> the country.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>Hence, we are of the considered view that mere fact<lb/> that the discretion conferred upon the court may<lb/> possibly be misused cannot be a ground to strike<lb/> down the validity of the provision. It is needless to<lb/> state that the Special Court is always expected to<lb/> apply the provisions of the statute in a fair and<lb/> reasonable manner keeping in mind the object<lb/> sought to be achieved by the implementation of the<lb/> enactment.<lb/></p>

			<p>(7) RE: VICARIOUS LIABILITY:<lb/></p>

			<p>112. Vicarious liability is fixed on the Director<lb/> of a company under Section 6 of the impugned Act.<lb/> It describes as to who should be punished in the case<lb/> of offence having been committed by a company. In<lb/> other words, it would indicate as to who should be<lb/> proceeded for the offence against any of the<lb/> provisions of the impugned Act or any rule made<lb/> thereunder. Similar provisions are found in several<lb/> enactments, both Central and State. To state a few,<lb/> they are, Essential Commodities Act, 1955, Drugs<lb/> and Cosmetics Act, 1940 etc. Only for the reasons a<lb/> person is a Director of the company, he does not<lb/> vicariously become liable for an offence committed by<lb/> the company. It must be shown, established and<lb/> proved that such person against whom the<lb/> prosecution is initiated was incharge of the company<lb/> and also responsible to the company in the conduct<lb/> of its business.<lb/> In case of the offence having<lb/> committed by a partnership firm, a person entrusted<lb/> with the business of the firm and responsible for<lb/> conducting of business alone would be liable to be<lb/> prosecuted and not all the partners. In fact, initial<lb/> burden lies on the prosecution to prove that the<lb/> accused was responsible for carrying on business<lb/> and was during relevant time incharge of the<lb/> business. In fact, Section 6 does not provide for<lb/> vicarious liability. It is trite law that penal provisions<lb/> are to be strictly construed. In the instances where<lb/> prosecution initiated against a person alleging that he<lb/> was the Director of the firm on the day the offence<lb/> was committed, if he/she is able to establish or<lb/> demonstrate that on the date of the offence, he/she<lb/> was not a Director, prosecution has to fail. A mere<lb/> bald statement that accused is a Director in the<lb/> complaint or FIR, would not suffice to constitute the<lb/> offence against such person. In other words, it has to<lb/> be averred specifically with all material particulars<lb/> that such person against whom the prosecution has<lb/> been launched is or was incharge or is/was<lb/> responsible for the company to conduct its business.<lb/> These proposition get support from the following<lb/> authoritative pronouncements of the Hon&apos;ble Apex<lb/> Court:<lb/></p>

			<p>113. It has been the contention of learned<lb/> Advocate appearing for petitioners that under the<lb/> impugned Act, there is no requirement of mens rea<lb/> and therefore impugned Act is unconstitutional. Said<lb/> contention requires to be considered for the purposes<lb/> of rejection inasmuch as, Section 2(f) specifically<lb/> states that every activity of grabbing land is &quot;with a<lb/> view to &quot; illegally take possession or enter into or<lb/> create tenancies and same would amount to land<lb/> grabbing. Thus, the use of the expression &quot;with a<lb/> view to &quot; would clearly indicate the requirement of<lb/> mens rea is in built or has been incorporated as an<lb/> ingredient of the offence of land grabbing. Even<lb/> otherwise, the provisions that create a strict law and<lb/> dispense with the requirement of mens rea is valid.<lb/> Even assuming that there is no requirement of<lb/> proving mens rea per se is not a ground to strike<lb/> down the Act as unconstitutional. This view also gets<lb/> fortified by the law laid down by Hon&apos;ble Apex Court<lb/> in the matter of KONDA LAKSHMANA BAPUJI vs.<lb/> GOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH &amp; OTHERS<lb/> reported in (2002)3 SCC 258 whereunder, it has<lb/> been held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;37.<lb/> The various meanings, noted<lb/> above, disclose that the term &quot;grab&quot;<lb/> has a broad meaning -to take<lb/> unauthorisedly, greedily or unfairly -<lb/>and a narrow meaning of snatching<lb/> forcibly<lb/> or<lb/> violently<lb/> or<lb/> by<lb/> unscrupulous means. Having regard<lb/> to the object of the Act and the<lb/> various provisions employing that<lb/> term we are of the view that the term<lb/> &quot;grab&quot; is used in the Act in both its<lb/> narrow as well as broad meanings.<lb/> Thus understood, the ingredients of<lb/> the expression &quot;land grabbing&quot; would<lb/> comprise (i) the factum of an activity<lb/> of taking possession of any land<lb/> forcibly, violently, unscrupulously,<lb/> unfairly or greedily without any lawful<lb/> entitlement<lb/> and<lb/> (ii)<lb/> the<lb/> mens<lb/> rea/intention --&quot;with the intention<lb/> of/with a view to&quot; (a) illegally taking<lb/> possession of such lands or (b) enter<lb/> into or create illegal tenancies, lease<lb/> and licence agreements or any other<lb/> illegal agreements in respect of such<lb/> lands;<lb/> or<lb/></item>

			<item>(c)<lb/> to<lb/> construct<lb/> unauthorised structures thereon for<lb/> sale or hire; or (d) to give such lands<lb/> to any person on (i) rental or (ii) lease<lb/> and licence basis for construction, or<lb/> (iii)<lb/> use<lb/> and<lb/> occupation<lb/> of<lb/> unauthorised structures.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>(9) RE: TRANSFER OF CASES:<lb/></p>

			<p>114. Section 20 of the Act is also sought to be<lb/> attacked on the ground of same being arbitrary and<lb/> on the mere say of the State, the civil suits pending<lb/> before the various Courts across the State are being<lb/> transferred and thereby the jurisdiction of the civil<lb/> court is being taken away. In fact, this court had an<lb/> occasion to examine as to the circumstances in which<lb/> the civil suit pending before the court can be<lb/> transferred to the Special Court. It came to be held<lb/> in W.P.No.51187/2019 disposed of on 26.11.2019 as<lb/> under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;24.<lb/> From a reading of the above<lb/> provisions, it is clear that unless an<lb/> act of land grabbing as defined under<lb/> Section 2(f) of the Act, extracted<lb/> above, is committed by a person who<lb/> can be termed as land grabber in<lb/> terms of Section 2(e), of land as<lb/> defined under section 2(d), no<lb/> proceedings can be initiated.<lb/> An<lb/> action can be brought against a<lb/> person if only such person satisfies<lb/> the definition of &apos;land grabber&apos; under<lb/> Section 2(e) of the Act, namely for<lb/> committing an act of &apos;land grabbing&apos;<lb/> as per Section 2(e).<lb/></item>

			<item>25.<lb/> An<lb/> action/suit/proceeding<lb/> brought about by any person seeking<lb/> to protect his/her interest would<lb/> establish that he/she does not come<lb/> within the four corners of the Act. At<lb/> the most, the defence that can be<lb/> taken up by the Authorities if they<lb/> have been arrayed as defendants in<lb/> that proceeding is to contend that the<lb/> land belongs to them and the plaintiff<lb/> has committed an act of land<lb/> grabbing, and therefore, the plaintiff<lb/> is not entitled for any protection or<lb/> reliefs in the said proceedings.<lb/></item>

			<item>26.<lb/> For an action to be initiated<lb/> under the Act, there has to be a<lb/> positive action by the Authorities<lb/> concerned. In that, there has to be<lb/> positive<lb/> proceedings<lb/> which<lb/> are<lb/> initiated against a land grabber for an<lb/> action of land grabbing. It is only<lb/> those proceedings which are pending<lb/> before any Authority or Court which<lb/> are required to be transferred to the<lb/> Special Court.<lb/></item>

			<item>27.<lb/> In the event of cases, where<lb/> the plaintiff has filed a suit against<lb/> the Governmental authority/ies to<lb/> protect his/her/its right over property<lb/> either<lb/> by<lb/> way<lb/> of<lb/> injunction,<lb/> declaration or otherwise and in that<lb/> suit, Governmental authorities who<lb/> are arrayed as defendants take up the<lb/> contention that the land in question is<lb/> a Government land and/or that<lb/> plaintiff had indulged in land<lb/> grabbing, thereby satisfying the<lb/> requirements of definition of &apos;land<lb/> grabber&apos;,<lb/> the Court or Authority<lb/> before whom such proceeding is<lb/> pending is:<lb/></item>

			<item>(i)<lb/> required to record a<lb/> reasoned finding as to<lb/> whether the Act is<lb/> attracted to that fact<lb/> situation after having<lb/> arrived at a conclusion<lb/> that land is Government<lb/> land;<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii)<lb/> arrive at a conclusion<lb/> that Act applies to the<lb/> land in terms of Section<lb/> 1(2) of the Act i.e., land as<lb/> defined under Section<lb/> 2(d) of the Act;<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) Plaintiff has committed<lb/> an act of grabbing the<lb/> land in term and section<lb/> 2(b),<lb/> without<lb/> lawful<lb/> entitlement with a view to<lb/> illegally take possession<lb/> of such land or enter into<lb/> or create illegal tenancies<lb/> or lease and licences<lb/> agreements<lb/> construct<lb/> unauthorized structures<lb/> thereon for sale or hire, or<lb/> give such land to any<lb/> person for rent or lease or<lb/> licence<lb/> basis<lb/> for<lb/> construction or use and<lb/> occupation.<lb/></item>

			<item>28.<lb/> In other words, Court or<lb/> authority has to arrive at a conclusion<lb/> that activity of grabbing of any land is<lb/> without any lawful entitlement and<lb/> with a view to illegally take possession<lb/> of such land.<lb/></item>

			<item>29.<lb/> Thus, necessarily if a person<lb/> is claiming a right by way of a lawful<lb/> entitlement<lb/> through<lb/> any<lb/> valid<lb/> document issued or granted in favour<lb/> of such person, which though<lb/> disputed by the Authorities concerned<lb/> on the ground that such a grant,<lb/> allotment or the like could not have<lb/> been made in favour of such persons,<lb/> so long as the said document relied<lb/> upon by the plaintiff is not countered<lb/> or negated on the basis of fraud or<lb/> forgery and the claim of the plaintiff<lb/> being one of a lawful entitlement,<lb/> such a proceedings pending before<lb/> competent Civil Court cannot be<lb/> transferred under the Act to the<lb/> Special Court.<lb/></item>

			<item>30.<lb/> If any action of land grabbing<lb/> has not been committed, plaintiff<lb/> therein cannot be termed to be a land<lb/> grabber. There is no unlawful act<lb/> committed.<lb/> Hence, in terms of<lb/> Section 7(1) of the Act, Special Court<lb/> would not have jurisdiction in the<lb/> matter. Section 7(1) of the Act is<lb/> reproduced<lb/> hereunder<lb/> for<lb/> easy<lb/> reference:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;7(1) Constitution of Special<lb/> Courts.-<lb/></item>

			<item>(1) The Government may, for<lb/> the purpose of providing<lb/> speedy enquiry into any<lb/> alleged<lb/> act<lb/> of<lb/> land<lb/> grabbing, and trial of cases<lb/> in respect of the ownership<lb/> and title to, or lawful<lb/> possession of, the land<lb/> grabbed and those offences<lb/> specified in Chapter XIV-A<lb/> of the Karnataka Land<lb/> Revenue Act, 1964, by<lb/> notification, constitute a<lb/> Special Court.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>31.<lb/> In such circumstances, any<lb/> such pending action cannot be<lb/> transferred to the Special Court in<lb/> terms of Section 20 of the Act. The<lb/> court before whom the matter is<lb/> pending would have to proceed with<lb/> the same in the ordinary course.<lb/></item>

			<item>32.<lb/> Under similar circumstances<lb/> in W.P.No.50704/2019, disposed of<lb/> by the bench on 19.11.2019 we have<lb/> held;<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;6. Having observed XXXX &amp;<lb/> JMFC, Mandya. Averments<lb/> made in the plaint as<lb/> extracted by the Special<lb/> Court would disclose that<lb/> plaintiff<lb/> had<lb/> specifically<lb/> contended<lb/> that<lb/> suit<lb/> schedule<lb/> property<lb/> was<lb/> granted to him by Tahsildar,<lb/> Mandya by grant order<lb/> RUOL<lb/> 674/98-99<lb/> on<lb/> 16.09.2002.<lb/> It is also<lb/> contended that by way of<lb/> such grant he has been in<lb/> possession and enjoyment of<lb/> said land and he has also<lb/> installed I.P. set and has<lb/> raised coconut, mango and<lb/> chikkoo trees.<lb/> In other<lb/> words, it is the specific case<lb/> of plaintiff that land in<lb/> question i.e., suit schedule<lb/> property was granted to him.<lb/> For initiating<lb/> proceedings<lb/> under the Karnataka Land<lb/> Grabbing Prohibition Act,<lb/> 2011, provisions of Sections<lb/> 2(e), 2(f) or 2(i) would be<lb/> subject to such person<lb/> falling within the definition<lb/> of Section 2(e) and 2(f) of the<lb/> Act. To put it differently,<lb/> Court adjudicating the lis<lb/> has to form an opinion that<lb/> land which is in question is<lb/> a government land and<lb/> plaintiff/defendant, as the<lb/> case may be, would fall<lb/> within the definition of<lb/> Section 2(e) or 2(f) and only<lb/> on such opinion being<lb/> formed or finding recorded<lb/> Civil Court will seize to have<lb/> jurisdiction and only such<lb/> matters requires to be<lb/> transferred to the Special<lb/> Court constituted under the<lb/> Act as prescribed under<lb/> Section 20. In the absence<lb/> of such opinion or finding<lb/> recorded by the Civil Court,<lb/> there<lb/> cannot<lb/> be<lb/> any<lb/> transfer/simplicitor&quot;.<lb/></item>

			<item>33.<lb/> The above being the position<lb/> of law, the action of Prl. Civil Judge<lb/> and JMFC, Mandya said to be acting<lb/> on the proceedings of Principal<lb/> District and Sessions Judge, Mandya<lb/> transferring<lb/> records<lb/> in<lb/> O.S.No.105/2015 to the Special Court<lb/> for disposal by referring to a<lb/> Notification issued by the Government<lb/> of Karnataka dated 10.08.2015 and<lb/> the circular of this Court dated<lb/> 22.03.2017 in a perfunctory manner<lb/> is impermissible. The circular of this<lb/> Court dated 22.03.2017 does not<lb/> withdraw and transfer the cases to the<lb/> Special Court. The said circular only<lb/> informs the jurisdictional District and<lb/> Sessions Judges of the constitution of<lb/> the Court and instructs such Judges<lb/> to withdraw and transfer the cases<lb/> &quot;falling under the Act&quot; to the<lb/> Special Court at Bengaluru.<lb/> It is<lb/> therefore incumbent upon<lb/> the<lb/> Presiding Officers where a particular<lb/> case is pending before said courts to<lb/> arrive at a conclusion that particular<lb/> case would satisfy the requirement of<lb/> Section 20 of the Act.<lb/> Only after<lb/> recording such satisfaction, the<lb/> Presiding Officer of such Court would<lb/> be empowered to transfer the matter<lb/> to the Special Court.<lb/></item>

			<item>34.<lb/> In the present case, there is<lb/> no objective satisfaction of the<lb/> requirement of Section 20 of the Act<lb/> recorded by the Prl. Civil Judge and<lb/> JMFC, Mandya and trial Judge has<lb/> proceeded to transfer the case as if<lb/> the<lb/> circular<lb/> dated<lb/> 22.03.2017<lb/> withdraws all the cases and transfers<lb/> the same to the Special Court<lb/> constituted under the Act, when in<lb/> fact, it does not. The said circular<lb/> categorically makes it clear that only<lb/> such of the cases falling under the Act<lb/> are<lb/> to<lb/> be<lb/> transferred.<lb/> The<lb/> determination thereof, has to be made<lb/> by a judicial order by the Presiding<lb/> Officer, and it cannot mechanically<lb/> transfer all matters merely because<lb/> there is an allegation of land grabbing<lb/> by any of the parites to the lis.<lb/></item>

			<item>35.<lb/> Any Court or Authority<lb/> intending to transfer any proceeding<lb/> to the Special Court has to satisfy<lb/> itself and pass an order in terms of<lb/> what is stated hereinabove. In the<lb/> absence thereof, there cannot be an<lb/> administrative order of transfer of a<lb/> case. In other words, it has to be a<lb/> judicial order passed after necessary<lb/> application of mind and law for<lb/> transferring the matter.<lb/></item>

			<item>36.<lb/> In view of the fact that there<lb/> is no judicial order passed and there<lb/> is no judicial application of mind to<lb/> the factual aspects on the part of the<lb/> Prl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Mandya,<lb/> in the manner observed by us<lb/> hereinabove<lb/> for<lb/> transferring<lb/> O.S.No.105/2015,<lb/> the<lb/> order<lb/> of<lb/> transfer made to the Special Court is<lb/> not sustainable. Hence, we are of the<lb/> considered<lb/> view<lb/> that<lb/> Judgment<lb/> passed by the Special Court in LGC(T)<lb/> No.1627/2018<lb/> arising<lb/> out<lb/> of<lb/> O.S.No.105/2015 is erroneous and<lb/> same is to be set-aside.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>115. In the light of the law laid down in the<lb/> aforesaid writ petition, we are of the considered view<lb/> that wherever the matters/suits which was pending<lb/> before the authorities or the civil courts, which has<lb/> since been transferred contrary to the dicta laid down<lb/> in the aforesaid case would require re-examination or<lb/> re-consideration by the Special Court. Hence, we<lb/> direct the Special Court to examine such cases<lb/> and pass appropriate orders keeping in mind the<lb/> observations<lb/> made<lb/> by<lb/> this<lb/> Court<lb/> in<lb/> W.P.No.51187/2019 disposed of on 26.11.2019.<lb/> The petitioners are also at liberty to move the<lb/> Special Court for appropriate orders being passed<lb/> in this regard.<lb/></p>

			<p>(10) RE: THOUGH SECTION 7 MANDATES<lb/> CONSTITUTION<lb/> OF<lb/> ADDITIONAL<lb/> BENCHES<lb/> ACROSS THE STATE, SAME HAS NOT BEEN<lb/> CONSTITUTED:<lb/></p>

			<p>116. Section 7 of the KLGP Act-2011 empowers<lb/> the State Government to constitute a Special Court.<lb/> Sub-section (4) of Section 7 empowers the State to<lb/> constitute additional Benches of Special Court by<lb/> issuance of notification in respect of such area as<lb/> may be specified therein. Substituted sub-section (3)<lb/> of Section 9 speaks of acts of land grabbing to be<lb/> tried only by the &quot;Special Courts constituted for<lb/> the area in which the land is situated, or where<lb/> there are more Special Courts than one for such<lb/> area, by such one of them as may be specified in<lb/> this behalf by the Government.&quot; The Government<lb/> being conscious of this fact, while sustaining the<lb/> impugned legislation, has placed on record by way of<lb/> written submission dated 23.12.2020 (Annexures-R1<lb/> to R3) indicating about 7878 cases having been<lb/> registered for the years 2016-2020 and 3429 cases<lb/> having been disposed of, leaving the pendency of the<lb/> cases at 4449. The person alleged or accused of<lb/> having either encroached or usurped the Government<lb/> land, in any remote part of the State of Karnataka,<lb/> would now be required to travel to the capital of the<lb/> State of Karnataka namely, Bengaluru which would<lb/> be not only onerous but also financially burdensome.<lb/> There are many instances where the small holding<lb/> farmers who either by sheer ignorance due to lack of<lb/> knowledge would be tilling a piece of land adjacent to<lb/> the land owned by them or granted by the<lb/> appropriate Government and in such circumstances<lb/> when they are visited with the prosecution or civil<lb/> case is filed, they are required to travel from the<lb/> remote corners which would not only be difficult but<lb/> would also cause undue and untold hardship and<lb/> correspondingly pinch their pocket and they have to<lb/> travel to the Special Court located in Bengaluru at<lb/> the cost of their day&apos;s livelihood. Keeping this in<lb/> mind, the legislature in its wisdom, has foreseen<lb/> such circumstances and has provided under Section<lb/> 7 of the impugned Act, vesting the power with the<lb/> State to constitute such additional Benches as it may<lb/> deem fit. Hence, we deem it fit and appropriate to<lb/> issue suitable direction to the State hereunder to<lb/> constitute Special Courts at the District level by<lb/> taking into relevant facts like number of cases,<lb/> feasibility, necessity, etc.,.<lb/></p>

			<p>(11) RE: ABATEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS.<lb/></p>

			<p>117. Unamended KLGP Act-2011 did not<lb/> provide for abatement of certain proceedings.<lb/> However, under the amended Act 30 of 2020, Section<lb/> 22 has been introduced and it reads:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;22.<lb/> Abatement.-<lb/>All<lb/> proceedings<lb/> pending<lb/> and<lb/> contemplated with respect to land as<lb/> excluded under the proviso to sub-<lb/>clause (d) of Section 2 of this Act, on<lb/> the date of commencement of the<lb/> Karnataka Land Grabbing Prohibition<lb/> (Amendment) Act, 2020 shall stand<lb/> abated&quot;.<lb/> In the light of certain proceedings pending and<lb/> contemplated in respect of land as excluded<lb/> under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of proviso to clause<lb/></item>

			<item>(d) of Section 2 of the KLGP Act-2011 providing<lb/> for such proceedings being excluded from the<lb/> purview of the Act, it would be necessary to<lb/> extract proviso to clause (d) of Section 2 and sub-<lb/>clauses (a) and (b) inserted thereunder:<lb/></item>

			<item>(d)&quot;Land&apos;&apos; includes,-<lb/></item>

			<item>(i) land belonging to the<lb/> Government, Wakf or the<lb/> Hindu Religious Institutions<lb/> and<lb/> Charitable<lb/> Endowments,<lb/> a<lb/> local<lb/> authority, a statutory or non<lb/> statutory<lb/> body<lb/> owned,<lb/> controlled or managed by the<lb/> Government;<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) rights in or over land,<lb/> benefits to arise out of land,<lb/> and buildings, structures and<lb/> other things attached to the<lb/> earth<lb/> or<lb/> permanently<lb/> fastened to anything attached<lb/> to the earth;<lb/></item>

			<item>Provided that &apos;land&apos;<lb/> shall not include lands in<lb/> respect of which applications<lb/> for grant are pending on the<lb/> date of commencement of<lb/> this Act,-<lb/></item>

			<item>(a) under sections 94A,<lb/> 94B, 94C and 94CC of the<lb/> Karnataka Land Revenue Act,<lb/> 1964 (Karnataka Act 12 of<lb/> 1964);<lb/></item>

			<item>(b)<lb/> under<lb/> the<lb/> Scheduled Tribes and other<lb/> Traditional Forest Dwellers<lb/> (Recognition of Forest Rights)<lb/> Act, 2006 (Central Act 2 of<lb/> 2007);&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>118. A plain reading of the above provisions<lb/> would clearly indicate that all proceedings<lb/> pending and contemplated with respect to land is<lb/> excluded from the purview of the Act and the<lb/> proceedings if any pending before the Special<lb/> Court in this regard would stand abated. In the<lb/> following cases, it would clearly indicate that<lb/> either the applicant has filed application seeking<lb/> regularisation under the provisions of the<lb/> Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 or the<lb/> Karnataka Land Grant Rules or the Scheduled<lb/> Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers<lb/> (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 etc.<lb/> before various authorities and said applications<lb/> have been either accepted by the Committees or it<lb/> is yet to be adjudicated by the appropriate<lb/> authorities.<lb/> Sl.No.<lb/> Writ petitions<lb/> 1<lb/> W.P.No.27437/2017<lb/> 2<lb/> W.P.No.56296/2017<lb/> 3<lb/> W.P.No.9194/2018<lb/> 4<lb/> W.P.No.22025/2018<lb/> 5<lb/> W.P.No.26054/2018<lb/> 6<lb/> W.P.No.26545/2018<lb/> 7<lb/> W.P.No.26546/2018<lb/> 8<lb/> W.P.NO.29281/2018<lb/> 9<lb/> W.P.No.33339/2018<lb/> 10<lb/> W.P.No.36737/2018<lb/> 11<lb/> W.P.No.39179/2018<lb/> 12<lb/> W.P.No.43352/2018<lb/> 13<lb/> W.P.No.49786/2018<lb/> 14<lb/> W.P.No.51528/2018<lb/> 15<lb/> W.P.No.55172/2018<lb/> 16<lb/> W.P.No.302/2019<lb/> 17<lb/> W.P.No.3463/2019<lb/> 18<lb/> W.P.No.3484/2019<lb/> 19<lb/> W.P.No.5393/2019<lb/> 20<lb/> W.P.No.8821/2019<lb/> 21<lb/> W.P.No.12974/2019<lb/> 22<lb/> W.P.No.22988/2019<lb/> 23<lb/> W.P.No.27336/2019<lb/> 24<lb/> W.P.No.27921/2019<lb/> 25<lb/> W.P.No.28900/2019<lb/> 26<lb/> W.P.No.29471/2019<lb/> 27<lb/> W.P.No.35575/2019<lb/> 28<lb/> W.P.No.35579/2019<lb/> 29<lb/> W.P.No.42273/2019<lb/> 30<lb/> W.P.No.51878/2019<lb/> 31<lb/> W.P.No.51879/2019<lb/> 32<lb/> W.P.No.52011/2019<lb/> 33<lb/> W.P.No.52566/2019<lb/> 34<lb/> W.P.No.45583/2019<lb/> 35<lb/> W.P.No.220/2020<lb/> Hence, aforesaid petitioners are entitled to<lb/> the relief sought for.<lb/> SUMMARY OF OUR CONCLUSIONS:<lb/></p>

			<p>119. In the light of aforestated discussion, we<lb/> have summarized our conclusion as under:<lb/></p>

			<p>(a) We uphold the constitutional validity of the<lb/> provisions of the Karnataka Land Grabbing<lb/> Act, 2011 (Karnataka Act 38 of 2014) as<lb/> amended by Act 30 of 2020 except to the<lb/> extent of striking down part of sub-section<lb/> (4) of Section 9 namely:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;But additional evidence, if<lb/> any adduced in the civil<lb/> proceedings shall not be<lb/> considered by the Special<lb/> Court while determining the<lb/> criminal liability&quot;<lb/> on the ground of arbitrariness and vagueness.<lb/></item>

			<item>(b) The admissibility of the evidence as<lb/> prescribed under Section 9(4) is ordered to<lb/> be read as:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;The evidence admitted in<lb/> criminal proceedings may be<lb/> made use of while trying the<lb/> civil liability and not vice<lb/> versa.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>(c) The abatement of proceedings referred to in<lb/> Section 22 by excluding the proceedings with<lb/> respect to the lands covered under the<lb/> proviso to sub-clause (d) of sub-section (2)<lb/> shall<lb/> also<lb/> mean<lb/> and<lb/> include,<lb/> &apos;the<lb/> proceedings under the Karnataka Land<lb/> Reforms Act, 1961, the Karnataka Land<lb/> Revenue Act, 1964, Land Grant Rules<lb/> Dharkasth Rules or any other Rules for grant<lb/> * Corrected vide court order dated 23.04.2021<lb/> of land, which has attained finality and not<lb/> pending in appeal or revision before any<lb/> other authority or forum&apos; and Section 2(d)<lb/> proviso together clause (a) &amp; (b) along with<lb/> Section 22 shall be read as such.<lb/></p>

			<p>(d) The provision of Section 9(5)(b) as amended<lb/> having<lb/> been<lb/> upheld,<lb/> the<lb/> expression<lb/> &quot;summary manner&quot; occurring in Clause (b)<lb/> and<lb/> expression<lb/> &quot;shall<lb/> be<lb/> tried<lb/> in<lb/> accordance with the procedure for trial of<lb/> warrant cases&quot; occurring in proviso<lb/> thereunder is ordered to be read as:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;The Special Court may try<lb/> every offence under the Act<lb/> as if it is a warrant case and<lb/> only<lb/> in<lb/> exceptional<lb/> circumstances, try in a<lb/> summary manner for reasons<lb/> to be recorded.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>(e) We hold that all other Sections which are<lb/> subject matter of challenge are legal and<lb/> valid.<lb/></p>

			<p>120. Having summarised the legal contentions<lb/> as noted herein above, we now proceed to deal with<lb/> few of the writ petitions on facts relating to different<lb/> facets and angles in the light of proposition of law<lb/> laid down, as discussed herein above.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.47747/2017:<lb/></p>

			<p>121. Petitioner claims to have entered into<lb/> Joint Development Agreement on 15.03.1995 with<lb/> Hanumanthaiah and family to develop the property<lb/> bearing Sy.No.37 measuring 6 acres 21 guntas which<lb/> is morefully described in the petition schedule and<lb/> has sought for quashing of the order dated<lb/> 08.03.2017 passed by the Special Court on the<lb/> ground of petitioners having encroached the Storm<lb/> Water Drain. The issue in this writ petition relates to<lb/> disputed question of fact, which cannot be gone into<lb/> by this court<lb/> under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> Re: W.P.No.433/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>122. Petitioner claims to have acquired title to<lb/> the property bearing Sy.No.183, Phodi No.285 of<lb/> Halagevoderahalli village, Kengeri Hobli, Bangalore<lb/> South Taluk under registered sale deed and after<lb/> conversion of the same, the revenue records have<lb/> been mutated in the name of M/s.Shakthi Hill<lb/> Resorts. The State is contending that the petitioner<lb/> has encroached Sy.No.8 of Vodderapalya and as<lb/> such, a complaint has been lodged before<lb/> Subrahmanyanagar Police Station under Section<lb/> 192A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 in<lb/> CC No. 4406/2013. When said proceedings were<lb/> pending, the impugned Act came into force and as<lb/> such, proceedings came to be transferred to the<lb/> Special Court. Petitioner is said to have filed a suit in<lb/> O.S.No.3595/2007<lb/> against respondents-1 to 3<lb/> herein and jurisdictional police and the suit came to<lb/> be decreed by judgment and decree dated<lb/> 12.09.2014. Whereas, the State is contending that<lb/> petitioner has encroached the Government land. This<lb/> is an issue which will have to be examined by the<lb/> Special Court and the said disputed question of fact<lb/> cannot be gone into by this court under Article 226<lb/> and 227 of the Constitution of India and as such, the<lb/> petition is dismissed.<lb/></p>

			<p>122.1 The judgment and decree passed in<lb/> O.S.No.3595/2007 which is said to be enuring to the<lb/> benefit of petitioner can be made use of by the<lb/> petitioner in the proceedings pending before the<lb/> Special Court.<lb/> The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.10728/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>123. Petitioner claims to have purchased the<lb/> land measuring 3 acres and 19.35 guntas in<lb/> Sy.No.95/1 and 95/2 situated at Veerasandra village,<lb/> Attibele Hobli, Anekal Taluk under registered sale<lb/> deed dated 26.07.2007. It is also contended that<lb/> prior to purchase, it had been converted to non-<lb/>agricultural purposes by the original owners. The<lb/> dispute in this petition relates to Sy.No.99 of<lb/> Veerasandra village, Anekal Taluk. The petitioner is<lb/> claiming to be not in possession of any part of<lb/> Sy.No.99 and the State is contending that petitioner<lb/> has encroached 24.5 guntas in Sy.No.99 and<lb/> attempting to demolish the structure. The issue in<lb/> this writ petition relates to disputed question of fact,<lb/> which cannot be gone into by this court<lb/> under<lb/> Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and<lb/> as such, the petition is liable to be dismissed. The<lb/> legal issues relating to the constitutional validity<lb/> urged in the writ petition has already been discussed<lb/> in detail herein above. Subject to the observations<lb/> made on the legal issues raised, this petition stands<lb/> dismissed.<lb/></p>

			<p>123.1 There is an interim order passed in<lb/> W.P.No.20892/2016 and 21084/2016 (KLR-RES)<lb/> restraining the respondents from demolishing the<lb/> property of the petitioner. The said order is in force<lb/> as on date. Subject to the final orders passed in the<lb/> said writ petition, the interim order would enure to<lb/> the benefit of petitioner notwithstanding the disposal<lb/> of this writ petition.<lb/> RE: W.P.No. 15532/2017:<lb/></p>

			<p>124. Petitioner is a House Building Co-<lb/>operative Society and had negotiated to purchase 100<lb/> acres of land in Adigarakallahalli village and claims to<lb/> have purchased either by itself or by its<lb/> representatives upon acquisition proceedings , the<lb/> plan came to be approved for 87 acres of land and is<lb/> said to have formed layout and allotted sites. Fifth<lb/> respondent was allotted site pursuant to order dated<lb/> 09.01.2015 and he being a member of the society , he<lb/> is said to have filed a complaint before the Karnataka<lb/> Land Grabbing Prohibitions Special Court contending<lb/> that Sy.No.47 is encroached. Petitioner is said to<lb/> have filed an application to get itself to have<lb/> impleaded. The said proceedings is pending before<lb/> Special Court.<lb/> As to whether Sy.No.47 of Adigara<lb/> Kallahalli village has been encroached or not is a<lb/> disputed question of fact. In other words, the issue<lb/> in this writ petition relates to disputed question of<lb/> fact, which cannot be gone into by this court under<lb/> Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and<lb/> as such, the petition is liable to be dismissed. The<lb/> legal issues relating to the constitutional validity<lb/> urged in the writ petition has already been discussed<lb/> in detail herein above. Subject to the observations<lb/> made on the legal issues raised, this petition stands<lb/> dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.16281/2017:<lb/></p>

			<p>125. The land bearing Sy.No.7 of Doddabele<lb/> village, Kengeri Hobli came to be granted in favour of<lb/> one Sri Narayani to an extent of 39 acres 18 guntas.<lb/> He sold an extent of 15 acres in favor of Mrs. Bhima<lb/> Mosa in the year 1933 as original grantee failed to<lb/> pay land revenue to Government, it was forfeited and<lb/> subsequently, the grantee paid the revenue to the<lb/> Government<lb/> on<lb/> 12.07.1937.<lb/> The<lb/> purchaser<lb/> Mrs.Bhima Mosa executed gift deed on 11.03.1938 in<lb/> favour of Mrs.Elu Stormier and Joseph Stormier.<lb/> One Mr.Chennaiah and his brother Mr.Tayappa<lb/> purchased 5 acres out of 15 acres that was sold by<lb/> the grantee on 25.06.1944, upon which it was<lb/> renumbered as<lb/> Sy.No.7/2.<lb/> First petitioner&apos;s<lb/> husband and father of petitioners-2 to 4 purchased<lb/> an extent of 4 acres 6 guntas under registered sale<lb/> deed dated 11.12.1992 from Mr.Chennaiah.<lb/></p>

			<p>125.1 Proceedings in R.A.No.179/1994-95 was<lb/> initiated by the Assistant Commissioner to ascertain<lb/> as to whether Sy.No.7/5 of Doddabele village is<lb/> actually a Government land or not. By order dated<lb/> 26.10.2012 it was held that Sy.No.7/2 owned by<lb/> petitioners as a private land and ordered for<lb/> restoration of revenue entry. The said order<lb/> challenged in Writ petition by third respondent came<lb/> to be dismissed on 16.11.2015 . In the meanwhile,<lb/> the land was converted for non-agricultural purposes<lb/> on 09.07.2013.<lb/> The appeal filed by the third<lb/> respondent challenging the mutation entry in favour<lb/> of the petitioners has been dismissed. Thus, it would<lb/> emerge from the records that it is a land which was<lb/> granted in favour of the predecessor in title of the<lb/> petitioners and the petitioners on facts, are entitled to<lb/> the relief sought for. Hence, writ petition deserves to<lb/> be allowed. Accordingly, writ petition is allowed.<lb/> However, the issue of constitutional validity has<lb/> already been upheld as discussed herein above.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.17180/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>126. The land bearing Sy.No.29 &amp; 31 of<lb/> Keeranegere village, Maralavadi Hobli, Kanakapura<lb/> Taluk measuring 1 acre 5 guntas and 21 guntas was<lb/> &quot;Sarkari Beelu&quot;. It is so reflected in all the revenue<lb/> records.<lb/> An entry has been made by the third<lb/> respondent by mutating the revenue records of the<lb/> said land in favour of the father of fourth respondent.<lb/> It is alleged that the said entry has been made in<lb/> collusion with the revenue authorities. The appeal<lb/> filed by the villagers before the appellate authority<lb/> came to be dismissed and the Deputy Commissioner<lb/> by order dated 19.08.2002 allowed the revision<lb/> petition and ordered for restoration of the name of the<lb/> Government.<lb/> This order was set aside in<lb/> W.P.No.34109/2002 by order dated 05.08.2005.<lb/></p>

			<p>126.1 The Deputy Commissioner once again<lb/> initiated action for restoration of the revenue entries<lb/> and for resumption of the subject lands. Hence, fifth<lb/> respondent filed W.P.No.11660-661/2010 challenging<lb/> the action of the revenue authorities, which writ<lb/> petition came to be disposed of with an observation<lb/> that by following the procedure contemplated in law<lb/> namely, under Section 136(3) of the Karnataka Land<lb/> Revenue Act, 1964 steps can be taken.<lb/> Hence,<lb/> Deputy Commissioner is said to have initiated<lb/> proceedings, who held that fifth respondent is<lb/> entitled for his name being entered in the revenue<lb/> records and as such, dismissed the revision petition.<lb/> On the advent of the impugned legislation complaint<lb/> has been filed by the petitioner before the Special<lb/> Court. The Special Court after appreciation of the<lb/> entire material, has refused to take cognizance of the<lb/> offence alleged and held it does not arise at all and<lb/> accordingly, the complaint is dismissed.<lb/></p>

			<p>126.2 In view of the fact that proceedings<lb/> under Section 136(3) having attained finality in<lb/> favour of fourth respondent, the claim of the<lb/> petitioner ought to fail and as such, we find there is<lb/> no infirmity in the order passed by the Special Court<lb/> calling for our interference. Hence, petition is<lb/> dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.21279/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>127. Petitioner has filed an application in Form<lb/> No.50<lb/> seeking<lb/> regularization<lb/> way<lb/> back<lb/> on<lb/> 19.08.1991. The revenue authorities are seized of the<lb/> matter and it is under consideration. The said claim<lb/> of the petitioner falls within the definition of Section<lb/> 2(d) and on account of said application having not<lb/> been disposed of, the proceedings before the Special<lb/> Court abates vide Section 22 of KLGP Act-2011 and<lb/> petition deserves to be allowed and accordingly, it is<lb/> allowed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.23095/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>128. Two acres of land in Sy.No.98 of<lb/> Kumbalgodu village came to be allotted by the Deputy<lb/> Commissioner in favour of 10 persons by O.M.dated<lb/> 30.05.1953. In the year 1954, Grant certificate came<lb/> to be issued in favour of Mr.Venkatachalaiah,<lb/> Mr.Hombarangaiah,<lb/> Mr.Hanumanthaiah<lb/> and<lb/> Mr.Kenchaiah. Phodi proceedings initiated resulted<lb/> in new Sy.No.being assigned in Sy.Nos.168 to 171.<lb/> On 24.08.2006, the Government granted permission<lb/> to Mr.Muttahanumaiah to sell the land bearing<lb/> Sy.No.168.<lb/> Likewise, permission was granted to<lb/> Smt.Kempamma, wife of late Mr.Venkatachalaiah,<lb/> Mr.Hombarangaiah and Smt.Lakkamma, wife of late<lb/> Kenchaiah to sell the land in Sy.No.169, 170 and 171<lb/> respectively by order dated 17.10.2012, 04.05.2015,<lb/> and 05.09.2006 respectively. Hence, Smt.Lakkamma<lb/> and others sold land bearing Sy.No.171 to Mr.Victor<lb/> Lobo and he in turn, sold 2 acres in favour of<lb/> Mr.Prakash Nath @ Shekarappa, petitioner herein.<lb/> Second respondent has filed a complaint alleging that<lb/> land in Sy.No.98 (old No.) that it was not granted to<lb/> anybody.<lb/> The Special Court by order dated<lb/> 23.01.2017 (Annexure-B) has taken cognizance of the<lb/> offence whereunder, it has recorded as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;The averments made in the<lb/> complaint is that the land in<lb/> Sy.No.98 of Kumbalgodu village,<lb/> Bangalore South Taluk measures<lb/> 80 acres 06 guntas and it is<lb/> recorded in the Government records<lb/> that the same is a Mufath Kaval.<lb/> This land measuring 80 acres 6<lb/> guntas was never granted to<lb/> anybody and at any point of time. It<lb/> is primafacie seen that some local<lb/> persons or outsiders in collusion<lb/> with the revenue authorities might<lb/> have fabricated illegal documents<lb/> and based on the same and after<lb/> getting phodi and conversion of<lb/> land, have grabbed the land&quot;.<lb/></item>

			<p>128.1<lb/> This order cannot be held as one<lb/> without due application of mind. However, this court<lb/> would not examine the probable defence at this stage<lb/> and it would be open for the petitioners to establish<lb/> before the Special Court as to the manner in which<lb/> they have acquired title and/or predecessors in title<lb/> having been granted land in question. We have not<lb/> expressed any opinion with regard to merits of the<lb/> case. Hence, writ petition stands dismissed. All<lb/> contentions of both parties are left open.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.23800/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>129. It is the contention of the petitioners that<lb/> land measuring 6 acres 34 guntas in Sy.No.58 of<lb/> Byrathi village, Bidarahalli Hobli, Bangalore East<lb/> Taluk was sold to one Sri Chick Anneppa by public<lb/> auction on 07.05.1985 and on his death, the revenue<lb/> records were mutated in the name of second<lb/> petitioner and his family members in the year 2005-<lb/>06. On 08.03.2007, second petitioner and his family<lb/> members sold the land in favour of first petitioner<lb/> and accordingly, revenue records were mutated in the<lb/> name of first petitioner. On account of an application<lb/> being filed for survey and fixing the boundaries and<lb/> though it was recommended by the Tahsildar, the<lb/> Assistant Commissioner passed an order for<lb/> mutating the revenue records in the name of the<lb/> Government. Hence, first petitioner filed an appeal<lb/> before the Special Deputy Commissioner, who<lb/> allowed the same by order dated 03.07.2009. This<lb/> was challenged by the State before Karnataka<lb/> Appellate Tribunal under Section 50 of the Karnataka<lb/> Land Revenue Act, which came to be dismissed by<lb/> order dated 26.02.2015 and undisputedly, there was<lb/> no challenge to this order or in other words, it has<lb/> attained finality.<lb/></p>

			<p>129.1 However, second respondent filed a<lb/> complaint before the Special Court, upon which the<lb/> cognizance has been taken. When the order passed<lb/> by the Appellate Tribunal has attained finality, there<lb/> was no justification for the jurisdictional Special<lb/> Court to have proceeded to initiate proceedings under<lb/> the impugned enactment. As such, the proceedings<lb/> pending before the jurisdictional Court cannot be<lb/> continued. The petitioners succeed and accordingly,<lb/> the petition is allowed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.25219/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>130. It is contended by the petitioners that the<lb/> land bearing Sy.No.15 measuring 20 acres was<lb/> granted on 12.11.1981. The Special Court based on<lb/> a newspaper article has taken cognizance of the<lb/> offence . The order of the Special Court taking<lb/> cognizance of the offence cannot be held as one<lb/> without the application of mind. It is for the<lb/> petitioners to demonstrate before the Special Court<lb/> the alleged grant made in their favour and proviso to<lb/> clause (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 9 of KLGP Act-<lb/>2011 empowers the Special Court to dismiss the<lb/> complaint or drop the proceedings if it is of the<lb/> opinion that there are no sufficient grounds for<lb/> proceeding. As such, it would be open for the<lb/> petitioners to establish the purported grant and its<lb/> genuineness, which cannot be gone into in this writ<lb/> petition. The issue in this writ petition relates to<lb/> disputed question of fact, which cannot be gone into<lb/> by this court<lb/> under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.27437/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>131. In this petition, undisputedly, petitioner<lb/> has filed an application under Section 94A of the<lb/> Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 for grant of 2<lb/> acres of land in Sy.No.203 of Singena Agrahara<lb/> village in Form No.53. In that view of the matter,<lb/> petitioner would be protected under Section 22 read<lb/> with Section 2(d) of the KLGP Act-2011 and the<lb/> proceedings before the Special Court stands abated.<lb/> In other words, petitioner is entitled to the relief<lb/> sought for. Hence, writ petition is allowed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.27573/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>132. The composite land bearing Sy.Nos.41<lb/> and 42 of Kaniminike village, Kengeri Hobli,<lb/> Bangalore South Taluk measuring around 300 acres<lb/> are said to have been given to Inamdars and one of<lb/> the Inamdars by name Sri Narasimharao executed a<lb/> sale deed on 28.09.1956 in favour of Sri Lakshmaiah.<lb/> The said Sri Lakshmaiah and one Mr.Venkatappa<lb/> conveyed the land to petitioner No.1 and Sri<lb/> N.J.Joseph under two separate sale deeds dated<lb/> 12.08.1965, pursuant to which revenue records were<lb/> mutated. The said Sri N.J.Joseph is said to have<lb/> conveyed half share in his property in favour of<lb/> petitioner No.2 by sale deed dated 31.03.1975 and on<lb/> his demise, his wife and children have executed<lb/> release deed on 24.03.2010 in favour of the second<lb/> petitioner and accordingly, revenue records were<lb/> mutated. Petitioners are claiming to have planted<lb/> more than 1600 coconut trees which are aged about<lb/> 35 to 37 years and are carrying on agricultural<lb/> operation.<lb/></p>

			<p>132.1 When the things thus stood , petitioners<lb/> are said to have been visited with an order dated<lb/> 31.05.2010 passed by second respondent holding<lb/> that 23 acres 33 guntas is a Government land and<lb/> the petitioners have encroached the same by violating<lb/> Section 192A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act.<lb/> Writ petition was filed in W.P.No.59242-243/2016<lb/> challenging the said order and same is said to be<lb/> pending. On the advent of the impugned legislation,<lb/> the proceedings have been initiated against<lb/> petitioners. As to whether the land claimed by the<lb/> petitioners is encroached and/or it is a Government<lb/> land is a disputed question of fact which cannot be<lb/> gone into by this court under Article 226 and 227 of<lb/> the Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.32134/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>133. Petitioners are claiming to be the absolute<lb/> owners of the property bearing Khata No.1194/1095<lb/> situated at Ward No.29, III Division, Chickballapur<lb/> Town and claims to have acquired title from Sri<lb/> Mallikarjuna Chinnappa Charitable Trust, under a<lb/> registered sale deed dated 16.03.2003 and having<lb/> purchased the same for consideration of Rs.50 lakhs.<lb/> The khata is also said to have been mutated to the<lb/> name of petitioners and taxes are said to have been<lb/> paid. The title is based on the registered partition<lb/> deed dated 16.12.1923 traceable to the predecessor<lb/> in title of the petitioners namely, Sri Chikkabasappa,<lb/> Sri Doddachinnappa and Sri Chikkachinnappa, who<lb/> are said to have constituted a charitable Trust in the<lb/> year 1964 and after having filed a petition under<lb/> Section 92(1) for grant of permission for sale of<lb/> property in favour of petitioners and in terms of the<lb/> judgment and decree dated 23.11.2001 whereunder<lb/> permission was granted , the property has been sold<lb/> for a valuable consideration of Rs.50 lakhs. An<lb/> application was filed by the petitioners to construct a<lb/> cinema theatre and at that point of time, the<lb/> Tahsildar is said to have given a negative report<lb/> behind the back of the petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<p>133.1<lb/> When<lb/> the<lb/> matter<lb/> stood<lb/> thus,<lb/> respondents-5 to 7 have filed a complaint against<lb/> petitioners under Section 9 of the impugned Act and<lb/> after calling for a detailed report from Deputy<lb/> Commissioner, which was submitted on 20.05.2017<lb/> and 08.06.2017, the Special Court is said to have<lb/> taken cognizance of the offence. In the reports dated<lb/> 20.05.2017 and 08.06.2017 (Annexures-D and D1)<lb/> the<lb/> Deputy<lb/> Commissioner<lb/> and<lb/> Municipal<lb/> Commissioner have opined that the property has<lb/> been sold violating the terms and conditions of the<lb/> Trust deed.<lb/></p>

			<p>133.2<lb/> It is an undisputed fact that the<lb/> property which was sold in favour of petitioners was<lb/> by virtue of the order passed by the competent court<lb/> in a Scheme suit i.e., O.S.No.2/2001 and when the<lb/> said judgment and decree has become final, it is not<lb/> open for the authorities to unsettle the settled<lb/> position that too, by invoking impugned legislation.<lb/> On facts, the petitioners are entitled to the relief<lb/> sought for. However, it is needless to state that<lb/> respondents-5 to 7 would be at liberty to<lb/> proceed/agitate their claim if any before the<lb/> competent civil court if there has been any violation<lb/> of the conditions of the Trust deed by the erstwhile<lb/> Trustees. Hence, petitioners are entitled to the relief<lb/> sought for. Accordingly, writ petition stands allowed.<lb/> RE: W.P.NO.32849/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>134. Petitioners are claiming to be the lawful<lb/> co-owners of coffee estate measuring 431 acres 7<lb/> guntas spread over 44 distinct Sy.Nos. and are<lb/> claiming right through inheritance. It is contended<lb/> that the partnership firm had purchased the lands<lb/> under registered sale deed dated 03.11.1965 and in<lb/> the year 1999 the Forest Guard, Sangameshwarpet<lb/> Branch, Balehonnur is said to have determined that<lb/> certain lands in Kadavanti village had been<lb/> unauthorisedly encroached by the father of the<lb/> petitioners.<lb/> It was determined that the purported<lb/> encroachment was to the extent of 165 acres. As to<lb/> whether there is encroachment, if so, to what extent<lb/> and when the said encroachment has taken place are<lb/> all disputed questions of fact, which cannot be gone<lb/> into by this court under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.33085/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>135. It is stated that petitioner&apos;s grandfather<lb/> Sri Hanumanthappa was the tenant of certain inam<lb/> lands including Sy.No.47 measuring 24 acres 37<lb/> guntas of Pantarapalya village, Kengeri Hobli,<lb/> Bangalore South Taluk and land Tribunal is said to<lb/> have<lb/> rejected<lb/> the<lb/> claim<lb/> and<lb/> affirmed<lb/> in<lb/> W.P.Nos.37145 &amp; 37229/2016 by order dated<lb/> 05.04.2017. The said order is now said to be pending<lb/> in W.A.Nos.2344-2347/2017 and the order of the<lb/> learned Single Judge is said to have been stayed.<lb/> Petitioner&apos;s claim for grant of occupancy rights is said<lb/> to be still pending.<lb/></p>

			<p>135.1 On the advent of the impugned Act, the<lb/> proceedings have been initiated. In view of our finding<lb/> that in respect of matters relating to tenancy pending<lb/> before the jurisdictional Court, the proceedings before<lb/> the Special Court cannot be proceeded with. The<lb/> outcome of the proceedings before the Special Court<lb/> could be regulated on the basis of the decision that<lb/> would be rendered in the pending Writ Appeal<lb/> Nos.2344-2347/2017. In the event of appellant not<lb/> succeeding in the said appeal, the proceedings before<lb/> the Special Court which has now been initiated in<lb/> GLC (S)No.14/2016 (suo motu) would stand revived<lb/> by itself or the respondent -authorities would be at<lb/> liberty to seek for revival of said proceedings.<lb/> Accordingly, proceedings before Special Court stands<lb/> disposed of with these observations.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.34202/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>136. Petitioner claims to have purchased the<lb/> land measuring 2 acres 30 guntas and kharab 26<lb/> guntas in Madanayakanahalli village, Dasanapura<lb/> Hobli, Bangalore North Taluk. Second respondent is<lb/> said to have filed a suit O.S.No.472/2014 against<lb/> petitioner and others seeking declaration that<lb/> plaintiffs are the owners of 1 acre 20 guntas out of<lb/> 4.02 guntas in Sy.No.17 including 31 gunas kharab<lb/> and to declare the sale deed dated 11.03.2002 as not<lb/> binding. During pendency of the said suit, a petition<lb/> under Section 9 has been filed by the second<lb/> respondent before the Special Court against<lb/> petitioner and 19 others alleging that respondents-1<lb/> and 2 before the Special Court have grabbed 6 guntas<lb/> in Sy.No.17 and 19 guntas in Sy.No.16/3 kharab<lb/> land and after formation of layout, respondents-1 and<lb/> 2 have sold sites to respondents-3 to 20 who are<lb/> attempting to put up construction. Based on the<lb/> order passed by the Tahsildar, Bangalore Taluk dated<lb/> 08.11.2013 and the revenue sketch produced by the<lb/> petitioner which supported the allegation made in the<lb/> petition, the cognizance has been taken by the<lb/> Special Court. As to what is the nature of kharab<lb/> and whether it is apt and appropriate to proceed<lb/> further cannot be gone into by this Court, since it is a<lb/> disputed question of fact requiring scrutiny of<lb/> evidence and it would be open for the Special Court<lb/> to examine the same and if it is of the opinion that<lb/> there are no sufficient grounds for proceeding, it can<lb/> dismiss the complaint or drop the proceedings as<lb/> contemplated under proviso to clause (b) of sub-<lb/>section (5) of Section 9 of KLGP Act-2011. Subject to<lb/> these observations, petition stands disposed of.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.35384/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>137. The suo motu proceedings came to be<lb/> initiated against the petitioner and summons was<lb/> issued as per order dated 07.02.2017. Petitioner who<lb/> is the Managing Director of the company M/s.Prestige<lb/> Estates Projects Limited has been issued with the<lb/> summons. Section 6 of the impugned Act would<lb/> indicate that where the offence is committed by a<lb/> company, every person who at the time of offence was<lb/> committed, was incharge and was responsible to the<lb/> company for the conduct or business of the company,<lb/> as well as the company, would be deemed to be guilty<lb/> of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded and<lb/> punished accordingly.<lb/></p>

			<p>137.2 It is trite law that the order taking<lb/> cognizance should be self evident about the<lb/> complicity of the person who is being arraigned as<lb/> accused or in other words, it should disclose that the<lb/> accused was either the person responsible to the<lb/> company for the conduct of its day to day business or<lb/> it was committed with his knowledge. In the absence<lb/> of these ingredients, the order of issuance of<lb/> summons by taking cognizance of the offence would<lb/> be illegal and as such, the proceedings cannot be<lb/> continued.<lb/></p>

			<p>137.3 In the instant case, the impugned order<lb/> dated 27.09.2016 as well as the subsequent orders<lb/> passed by the Special Court does not disclose either<lb/> petitioner having committed the offence of land<lb/> grabbing or the same having been done by the<lb/> company at the instance of petitioner and petitioner<lb/> being the Director, was aware of this fact and as<lb/> such, he was responsible to the company for conduct<lb/> of its business. Hence, the impugned order dated<lb/> 27.09.2016 (Annexure-B) and the proceedings<lb/> pending against petitioner before Special Court<lb/> cannot be sustained and it is quashed. Accordingly,<lb/> writ petition is allowed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.36324/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>138. Petitioner claims to be the owner of the<lb/> land bearing Sy.No.38 situated at 15 th Cross, 2 nd<lb/> Block, R.T.Nagar, Bangalore. It is stated that the<lb/> land originally bearing Sy.No.38/2 measuring 3 acres<lb/> 14 guntas was acquired by Sri M R Govindaraju on<lb/> 18.05.1949 under registered partition deed and it<lb/> was converted on 10.06.1982 from agricultural to<lb/> non-agricultural purposes and betterment charges<lb/> were also paid. Petitioner is claiming to be the wife of<lb/> Sri Govindaraj. She has contended that the BBMP<lb/> authorities have mutated the revenue records and<lb/> has been collecting the taxes.<lb/></p>

			<p>138.1 Suo motu proceedings have been<lb/> initiated for removal of encroachment of 6 ½ gunts of<lb/> Raja kaluve at R.T.Nagar-Dinnur main road. As to<lb/> what is the extent of Raja Kaluve and the buffer zone<lb/> for the said raja Kaluve are all matters of evidence<lb/> and the said issue cannot be gone into in the writ<lb/> proceedings<lb/> under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.36610/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>139. Petitioners are the office bearers of the<lb/> &quot;Bangalore Airport City Lions Services Trust&quot; which is<lb/> part of Lions Club of Bangalore Airport. It is said to<lb/> be carrying on welfare camps at various places in<lb/> Bangalore East Taluk. On a representation made on<lb/> 16.08.1998 and 31.07.1999 to grant 1 acre 15<lb/> guntas in Sy.No.103 of Munnekolalu village,<lb/> Bangalore East Taluk and to take up the project of<lb/> running a hospital, it is pending consideration. The<lb/> revenue authorities have conducted the inspection<lb/> including the Special Deputy Commissioner and have<lb/> submitted a report that a hospital has been<lb/> constructed and petitioners are in possession of said<lb/> area. In fact, the Special Deputy Commissioner by<lb/> communication dated 20.11.2000 has directed the<lb/> Tahsildar to re-submit the file by fixing the market<lb/> value of the property and a detailed report has been<lb/> submitted by the Revenue Inspector on 22.12.2000<lb/> (Annexure-D2).<lb/> Several<lb/> inter-departmental<lb/> communications<lb/> have<lb/> taken<lb/> place<lb/> and<lb/> by<lb/> communication dated 28.04.2003 (Annexure-K), the<lb/> Deputy Commissioner has recommended to the<lb/> Divisional Commissioner for grant of the land in<lb/> question by levying fine for the hospital building. In<lb/> fact, by communication dated 30.07.2008 (Annexure-<lb/>N), the Special Deputy Commissioner has directed<lb/> the Assistant Commissioner to take steps to mutate<lb/> the khata in the name of the Trust with respect to the<lb/> land in question.<lb/></p>

			<p>139.1<lb/> The Tahsildar, by order dated<lb/> 20.05.2013 (Annexure-R) has initiated proceedings<lb/> that 33 guntas in Sy.No.103 has been encroached by<lb/> the petitioners and the said land is a Government<lb/> land. Appeal has been filed in No.100/2017 which is<lb/> said to be pending. In the meanwhile, on the advent<lb/> of the impugned Act, the proceedings have been<lb/> initiated against petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>139.2 The application for grant of the land now<lb/> pending before the revenue authorities and it is yet to<lb/> be adjudicated and also the fact that appeal filed<lb/> against the order dated 20.05.2013 passed by the<lb/> Tahsildar now pending in Appeal No100/2017 before<lb/> the appellate tribunal, case of the petitioners would<lb/> fall under clause (a) of the proviso to Section 2(d) and<lb/> as such, the petitioners are entitled to succeed in this<lb/> petition. However, it is made clear that authorities<lb/> would be at liberty to proceed against petitioners in<lb/> the event of the application for grant of land sought<lb/> for by the petitioners being rejected by the revenue<lb/> authorities and the Appeal No.100/2017 being<lb/> dismissed. Hence, the petition is allowed subject to<lb/> the observations made herein above.<lb/> RE: W.P.No. 36640/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>140. It is claimed that father of the petitioner<lb/> was<lb/> granted<lb/> land<lb/> measuring<lb/> 2<lb/> acres<lb/> in<lb/> Tigalachowdanahalli village, Sarjapura on 12.11.1964<lb/> and by virtue of the same, revenue records were<lb/> mutated in the name of the grantee. On 21.02.2013<lb/> second respondent submitted a report to the Special<lb/> Deputy Commissioner, Bangalore District for<lb/> initiation of proceedings under Section 136(3) of KLR<lb/> Act, which came to be dropped on 21.03.2013. The<lb/> Government of Karnataka directed the Deputy<lb/> Commissioner to re-examine the orders passed by the<lb/> Deputy<lb/> Commissioner.<lb/> Hence,<lb/> Deputy<lb/> Commissioner issued notice to the petitioner and an<lb/> order came to be passed on 06.09.2016 (Annexure-M)<lb/> holding that the grant in favour of the petitioner is<lb/> genuine. Petitioner has continued to be in lawful<lb/> possession of the property.<lb/></p>

			<p>140.1 However, the proceedings under the<lb/> impugned Act came to be initiated on 27.11.2016 in<lb/> the light of the newspaper report. On service of<lb/> summons, petitioner has appeared before the Special<lb/> Court and produced the order of the Deputy<lb/> Commissioner dated 06.09.2016. Yet, on the ground<lb/> that the learned Advocate has not properly answered<lb/> the queries of the Special Court, the genuineness of<lb/> the grant is suspected. In fact, Special Court also<lb/> records its finding in the order passed by the Deputy<lb/> Commissioner, the land granted to the father of<lb/> petitioner was 2 acres. However, the sketch shows<lb/> that it is an extent of 2.25 acres. On this ground, the<lb/> Special Court has proceeded to frame the charges.<lb/> When the grant is not held to be genuine or it is not<lb/> found to be fabricated, question of proceeding under<lb/> the impugned Act, on the facts and circumstances of<lb/> the case is not called for. Hence, we are of the<lb/> considered view that petitioner is entitled to the relief<lb/> sought for. Accordingly, petition is allowed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.36690/2017<lb/> 141. Petitioners-1 and 2 are said to have<lb/> purchased the property to the extent mentioned in<lb/> the sale deed dated 11.07.2013 in Sy.No.123, 124,<lb/> 126, 127, 129 &amp; 132 of Narayanaghatta village,<lb/> Sarjapura Hobli, Anekal Taluk and have converted<lb/> the said property to residential purposes by the<lb/> District Commissioner by order dated 30.05.2016<lb/> and 19.05.2016. It is also stated that petitioners-3<lb/> and 4 have not purchased any land in the said<lb/> village.<lb/></p>

			<p>141.1 A suo motu proceedings have been<lb/> initiated by the Special Court on the basis of<lb/> newspaper article. Cognizance of the alleged offence<lb/> has been taken by the Special Court and before<lb/> taking cognizance, detailed report from the<lb/> jurisdictional Tahsildar was called for and the report<lb/> of the Tahsildar indicated that an extent of 2 acres 20<lb/> guntas in Sy.No.128 had been encroached upon and<lb/> possession has since been taken. However, there is<lb/> no whisper with regard to the complicity of accused<lb/> Nos.3 and 4. As to whether the petitioners-1 and 2<lb/> had encroached Sy.No.128 to the extent of 2 acres 20<lb/> guntas as alleged is a matter which requires to be<lb/> examined and the claim of the petitioners for<lb/> quashing of the proceedings initiated by the Special<lb/> Court against them cannot be entertained. The issue<lb/> in this writ petition relates to disputed question of<lb/> fact, which cannot be gone into by this court under<lb/> Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and<lb/> as such, the petition is liable to be dismissed. The<lb/> legal issues relating to the constitutional validity<lb/> urged in the writ petition has already been discussed<lb/> in detail herein above. Subject to the observations<lb/> made on the legal issues raised, this petition stands<lb/> dismissed insofar as petitioners-1 and 2 are<lb/> concerned.<lb/></p>

			<p>141.2 However, the proceedings initiated in<lb/> LGC.125/2016 (Annexure-A) insofar as petitioners -<lb/>3 and 4 by the Special Court stands quashed.<lb/> Hence, petition is allowed in part.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.36760/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>142. Petitioner claims to have acquired title to<lb/> the property bearing Sy.No.183, Phodi No.285 of<lb/> Halagevoderahalli village, Kengeri Hobli, Bangalore<lb/> South Taluk under registered sale deed and after<lb/> conversion of the same, the revenue records have<lb/> been mutated in the name of M/s.Shakthi Hill<lb/> Resorts. The State is contending that the petitioner<lb/> has encroached Sy.No.8 of Vodderapalya and as<lb/> such, a complaint has been lodged before<lb/> Subrahmanyanagar Police Station under Section<lb/> 192A of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 in<lb/> CC No. 4406/2013. When said proceedings were<lb/> pending, the impugned Act came into force and as<lb/> such, proceedings came to be transferred to the<lb/> Special Court. Petitioner is said to have filed a suit in<lb/> O.S.No.3595/2007<lb/> against respondents-1 to 3<lb/> herein and jurisdictional police and the suit came to<lb/> be decreed by judgment and decree dated<lb/> 12.09.2014. Whereas, the State is contending that<lb/> petitioner has encroached the Government land. This<lb/> is an issue which will have to be examined by the<lb/> Special Court and the said disputed question of fact<lb/> cannot be gone into by this court under Article 226<lb/> and 227 of the Constitution of India and as such, the<lb/> petition is dismissed.<lb/> The judgment and decree<lb/> passed in O.S.No.3595/2007 which is said to be<lb/> enuring to the benefit of petitioner can be made use<lb/> of by the petitioner in the proceedings pending before<lb/> the Special Court. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.37713/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>143. Petitioner claims to be the owner of land<lb/> bearing Sy.No.121 of Vabasandra village, Kasaba<lb/> Hobli, Gudibande Taluk, Chikballapur District<lb/> measuring 2 acres 30 guntas having purchased<lb/> under the sale deed dated 24.01.2007 and Khata is<lb/> said to have been mutated in the name of the<lb/> petitioner in the revenue records.<lb/></p>

			<p>143.1 Proceedings under the impugned Act<lb/> came to be initiated by 7 th respondent before the<lb/> Special Court and the Special Court after having<lb/> taken cognizance issued notice to the petitioner<lb/> herein.<lb/> The objections filed and the documents<lb/> produced by the petitioner did not disclose the title of<lb/> the vendor of the petitioner. In fact, the mutation<lb/> entry made in favour of the petitioner was cancelled<lb/> in<lb/> R.A.(G)<lb/> 55/2014-15<lb/> by<lb/> the<lb/> Assistant<lb/> Commissioner. The revision proceedings pending<lb/> before Deputy Commissioner came to be transferred<lb/> to Special Court. In fact, in the civil proceedings,<lb/> petitioner has been unsuccessful to establish<lb/> primafacie possession of the land. That apart, the<lb/> possession of the land in question was taken from<lb/> petitioner by the State on 10.03.2017. All these facts<lb/> have persuaded the Special Court to continue with<lb/> the proceedings which we find does not suffering<lb/> from any infirmity calling for our interference.<lb/></p>

			<p>143.2 The issue in this writ petition relates to<lb/> disputed question of fact, which cannot be gone into<lb/> by this court<lb/> under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed.

			<p>144. The petitioner is said to be the Managing<lb/> Trustee of Hanumagiri Private Trust and it is stated<lb/> that a temple had been in existence in Sy.No.28 of<lb/> Arehalli village, Uttarahalli Hobli, Bangalore South<lb/> Taluk for over 150 years.

A reply<lb/> was submitted on 11.01.2017 either for absolute<lb/> grant or for grant of lease for minimum period of 30<lb/> years. However, even before the ink on the said<lb/> representation could dry, the proceedings have been<lb/> initiated under the impugned Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>144.2<lb/> When the representation of the<lb/> petitioner dated 11.01.2017 (Annexure-F) seeking for<lb/> grant of the land is pending, we are of the considered<lb/> view that proceedings under the impugned Act<lb/> cannot be continued in view of the fact that<lb/> proceedings abates as provided under Section 22<lb/> read with Section 2(d) of KLGP Act-2011 and the said<lb/> benefit extended to all the applicants where same is<lb/> pending before the authorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>144.3 Hence, the petitioner succeeds and<lb/> proceedings pending before Special Court against<lb/> petitioner in LGC (S) 13/2017 stands quashed as<lb/> having abated. However, we make it clear that in the<lb/> event of application/representation of the petitioner<lb/> being dismissed or rejected by the authorities, the<lb/> respondent-authorities would be at liberty to initiate<lb/> proceedings afresh against petitioner.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.41593/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>145. On the basis of newspaper report dated<lb/> 18.07.2016 that respondents have taken possession<lb/> of encroached Government land including the land in<lb/> Haralur village, Bangalore East Taluk, suo motu<lb/> proceedings came to be initiated against petitioner<lb/> and summons was issued to the Manager of<lb/> M/s.Prestige Group, who in turn, appeared and<lb/> obtained bail. The Special Court noticed that case<lb/> against each one of accused is in different Sy.Nos.<lb/> and at different places, directed the Office to split the<lb/> case against accused person. The case pertaining to<lb/> Sy.No.32 of Haralur village, Bidarahalli Hobli was<lb/> renumbered as LGC(S)508/2017.<lb/> In fact, the<lb/> Manager who appeared before the Special Court has<lb/> filed his statement of objections and brought to the<lb/> notice of the Special Court about the notice issued on<lb/> 12.01.2016 by the fourth respondent herein alleging<lb/> encroachment of the Government lake, for which,<lb/> reply dated 27.01.2016 (Annexure-J) have been<lb/> submitted by M/s.Prestige Estates Project Limited,<lb/> whereunder an appointment of the Surveyor was<lb/> sought for to bifurcate the land owned by the<lb/> company and the Government lake. However, no<lb/> such surveyor has been appointed.<lb/> Yet, the<lb/> proceedings against the petitioner has been initiated.<lb/> Either in the order dated 27.09.2016 or the<lb/> subsequent orders passed by the Special Court do<lb/> not disclose about petitioner having committed the<lb/> offence of land grabbing or the same having been<lb/> done by the company at the instance of the petitioner<lb/> or petitioner being the Director, was aware of this fact<lb/> and as such, he was responsible to the company for<lb/> conduct of its business.<lb/></p>

			<p>145.1 It is trite law that the order taking<lb/> cognizance should be self evident about the<lb/> complicity of the person who is being arraigned as<lb/> accused or in other words, it should disclose that the<lb/> accused was either the person responsible to the<lb/> company for the conduct of its day to day business or<lb/> it was committed with his knowledge. In the absence<lb/> of these ingredients, the order of issuance of<lb/> summons by taking cognizance of the offence would<lb/> be illegal and as such, the proceedings cannot be<lb/> continued.<lb/> Hence, the impugned order dated<lb/> 27.09.2016 (Annexure-C) and the proceedings<lb/> pending against petitioner before Special Court<lb/> cannot be sustained and it stands quashed.<lb/> Accordingly, writ petition is allowed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.42959/2017<lb/> 146. First petitioner claims to be the absolute<lb/> owner of the land bearing Sy.No.86/2 (Sy.No.86)<lb/> measuring 20 guntas and Sy.No.178/1 measuring 17<lb/> guntas of Kothanoor village, Uttarahalli Hobli,<lb/> Bangalore South Taluk.<lb/> It is stated that said<lb/> Sy.No.86 measured in all, 9 acres 8 guntas was<lb/> purchased by Sri Dayananda Reddy under sale deed<lb/> dated 10.07.1969. The said property was phoded and<lb/> separate hissa number is allotted as 86/1, 86/2 and<lb/> 86/3 and same not being in accordance with the title<lb/> deeds, the Joint Director of Land Records set aside<lb/> the phodi by order dated 22.03.2017. However,<lb/> during the interregnum, the property which was<lb/> phoded as 86/2 measuring 1 acre 14 guntas and 4<lb/> guntas of kharab was converted from agricultural to<lb/> non-agricultural residential purposes by order dated<lb/> 09.03.1993.<lb/> First petitioner is said to have<lb/> purchased the property in Sy.No.86/2 measuring 20<lb/> guntas under a sale deed dated 25.11.2011<lb/> (Annexure-B). Petitioners claim to have obtained<lb/> approvals from statutory authorities for the purpose<lb/> of development and construction of residential<lb/> apartments and construction was commenced.<lb/></p>

			<p>146.2 The orders passed by the Special Court<lb/> on 22.02.2017 would disclose that the Deputy<lb/> Director of Town Planning, Head Office, BBMP has<lb/> been directed to furnish all the details of the<lb/> construction made by first petitioner and the<lb/> jurisdictional Tahsildar has been directed to file<lb/> survey report. However, the subsequent order does<lb/> not indicate about such details or reports having<lb/> been placed before the Special Court. In fact, by order<lb/> dated 04.07.2017 the Deputy Director (Town<lb/> Planning), Head Office, BBMP has been directed to<lb/> produce records regarding constructions made by<lb/> first petitioner. This also seems to have not placed<lb/> before the Special Court and on account of notice<lb/> issued by the Special Court, petitioners are before<lb/> this court.<lb/></p>

			<p>146.3 In the light of Section 9 having been<lb/> amended by Act 30 of 2020 and proviso to clause (b)<lb/> of sub-section (5) of 19 enabling the Special Court to<lb/> dismiss the complaint or drop further proceedings, if<lb/> it is of the opinion that there are no sufficient<lb/> grounds for proceeding, it is open to the Special<lb/> Court to dismiss or drop the proceedings against<lb/> petitioners.<lb/> However, for arriving at such a<lb/> conclusion, reports which have been called for will<lb/> have to be necessarily looked into.<lb/></p>

The Special Court has arrived at a<lb/> conclusion that there was enough material on record<lb/> to show that the allegation of land grabbing made<lb/> against respondents-1 to 4<lb/> for the offence<lb/> punishable under the impugned Act being there.<lb/> Hence, cognizance has been taken and challenging<lb/> the same, on various grounds, this petition has been<lb/> filed.<lb/></p>

It is<lb/> stated that BBMP has accorded approval for<lb/> construction. A supplemental agreement is said to<lb/> have been entered on 18.11.2010<lb/> (Annexure-B).<lb/></p>

			<p>148.1 Based on a newspaper report, suo motu<lb/> proceedings have been initiated against petitioner<lb/> alleging land in Sy.No.43 of Kalena Agrahara lake has<lb/> been encroached.<lb/></p>

			<p>148.2 In fact, a complaint was given by<lb/> Executive Engineer, Byatarayanapura zone on<lb/> 08.10.2015 stating thereunder that one boy by name<lb/> Master Prakash, aged 15 years have been drawn in to<lb/> Raja Kaluve coming under the jurisdiction of Ward<lb/> No.6 of BBMP, wherein Raja Kaluve was crossing the<lb/> property of petitioner and dead body of the boy was<lb/> found near the Raja Kaluve. It is this incident which<lb/> is said to have resulted in the proceedings being<lb/> initiated against petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>148.3 The sum and substance of the grievance<lb/> of the petitioner is on mere surmises the proceedings<lb/> have been initiated against petitioner and no portion<lb/> of any Government land has been encroached upon<lb/> and there is a road between disputed Sy.No.44 and<lb/> the Kalena Agrahara lake. Hence, the petitioner has<lb/> sought for quashing of the proceedings by relying<lb/> upon several documents along with the petition and<lb/> also by relying upon the photographs appended<lb/> thereto.<lb/></p>

			<p>148.4 As to whether there exists a lake, the<lb/> extent of it, the area or the land owned by the<lb/> petitioner and the construction put up thereof by the<lb/> petitioner is within the said area or by encroaching<lb/> upon the abutting and adjacent Government land are<lb/> all disputed questions of fact, which cannot be gone<lb/> into by this court under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed.

			<p>149. It is the contention of petitioners that land<lb/> bearing Sy.No.249 measuring 7 acres 28 guntas and<lb/> Sy.No.35 measuring 35 guntas of Y.N.Hoskote village,<lb/> Pavagada Taluk originally belonged to Sri Koteswara<lb/> devaru and it was an inam land. It is further<lb/> contended that one Sri Kare Hanumanthappa was<lb/> occupier of the land for more than 30 years and he<lb/> purchased the said land from Sri Markandeya<lb/> Shastri, who in turn, purchased the said land from<lb/> Sri Ashwath Shastri who is said to be the recognized<lb/> holder and title deed was issued in his name.<lb/></p>

			<p>149.1 Proceedings against the petitioners came<lb/> to be initiated by the Special Court on the basis of the<lb/> report published in the local newspaper of temple<lb/> land having been encroached upon. Subsequently,<lb/> second respondent herein is said to have filed a<lb/> complaint against petitioners herein and other<lb/> persons alleging that land belonging to the temple<lb/> has been usurped.<lb/></p>

			<p>149.2 The order taking cognizance as well as<lb/> the subsequent order dated 25.05.2017 passed by<lb/> the Special Court would indicate that on the basis of<lb/> statement made by the members of the Gram<lb/> Panchayat and Zilla Panchayat about property<lb/> belonging to the temple have been illegally acquired<lb/> by the members of the Revenue Department and the<lb/> temple priests by producing false documents and<lb/> selling the same, resulted in notices being issued to<lb/> the petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<p>149.3 The issue as to whether records relied<lb/> upon by petitioners are genuine or otherwise is to be<lb/> examined after full fledged trial and this court in writ<lb/> jurisdiction would not be in a position to examine the<lb/> said facts. In other words, the issue involved in this<lb/> writ petition relates to disputed questions of fact,<lb/> same cannot be gone into by this court under Article<lb/> 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and as such,<lb/> the petition is liable to be dismissed. The legal issues<lb/> relating to the constitutional validity urged in the writ<lb/> petition has already been discussed in detail herein<lb/> above.

			<p>150.1 The sum and substance of the grievance<lb/> of the petitioners is on mere surmises the<lb/> proceedings have been initiated against petitioners<lb/> and no portion of any Government land has been<lb/> encroached upon and petitioners have not<lb/> encroached the Raja Kaluve.

			<p>150.2 As to whether petitioners have<lb/> encroached any portion of the land adjacent to Raja<lb/> Kaluve or the Raja Kaluve itself is an issue which will<lb/> have to be examined after evaluating the evidence<lb/> that may be tendered by the parties before the<lb/> Special Court.<lb/> These disputed questions of facts<lb/> cannot be gone into by this court under Article 226<lb/> and 227 of the Constitution of India and as such, the<lb/> petition is liable to be dismissed.

Undisputedly,<lb/> said order of grant has not been set aside. In view of<lb/> the fact that the land in question which is alleged to<lb/> have been grabbed by petitioner not being in illegal<lb/> possession and by virtue of the grant, he being in<lb/> possession, proceedings initiated against petitioner<lb/> cannot be continued. As such, petitioner succeeds<lb/> and accordingly, writ petition stands allowed.<lb/> Proceedings initiated against petitioner now pending<lb/> in LGC(P)637/2017 before the Special Court<lb/> (Annexure-A) insofar as petitioner is concerned is<lb/> quashed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.47887/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>152.

			<p>152.1 On the advent of the impugned Act, same<lb/> has been transferred to the Special Court. The issue<lb/> involved in this writ petition relates to illegal<lb/> occupation of the land by the petitioner, which is a<lb/> disputed question of fact and same cannot be gone<lb/> into by this court under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.50674/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>153. Petitioner claims to be the absolute owner<lb/> in possession of vacant site bearing No.26 of<lb/> Vasanthapura village having purchased the same<lb/> from M.L.Ramachandra Gowda under registered sale<lb/> deed dated 08.07.2003. The said site is said to have<lb/> been formed in land bearing Sy.No.54 and not in<lb/> Sy.No.55. it is further claimed that vendor had<lb/> acquired the said property under registered partition<lb/> deed dated 26.12.1974. It is stated that petitioner<lb/> has sold the site to one Sri Krishnamurthy Naidu<lb/> under registered sale deed dated 23.09.2004 and he<lb/> in turn, has sold the same in favour of Smt.R<lb/> Vasantha under sale deed dated 16.05.2006, who is<lb/> said to have put up construction of a house and<lb/> residing therein. It is contended that site No.26<lb/> purchased by the petitioner is in no way connected to<lb/> the land bearing Sy.No.55.<lb/></p>

			<p>153.1 As to whether the site purchased by the<lb/> petitioner is in Sy.No.54 or any portion of the sites<lb/> formed in Sy.No.54 will have to be examined on the<lb/> basis of the evidence that may be tendered by the<lb/> parties. It is for this precise reason, the Special Court<lb/> while taking cognizance of the offence has opined<lb/> that petitioner herself is not sure of the exact location<lb/> of her site. It is needless to state that petitioner were<lb/> to demonstrate before the Special Court that site<lb/> purchased by her did not fall within Sy.No.55 and it<lb/> is carved out of Sy.No.54, necessarily the Special<lb/> Court would drop further proceedings by taking<lb/> recourse to proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (5) of<lb/> Section 9.<lb/></p>

			<p>153.2 The issue in this writ petition relates to<lb/> disputed question of fact, which cannot be gone into<lb/> by this court under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.51160/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>154. Petitioners have been granted 2 acres<lb/> each to carry out quarrying in Sy.No.224/P1 at<lb/> Daddigatta (Bettadahalli), Shravanabelagola Hobli,<lb/> Chennarayapatna Taluk under Karnataka Minor<lb/> Mineral Concession Rules. This is borne by the<lb/> voluminous records produced by the petitioners,<lb/> which fact is also admitted by the Special Court itself<lb/> in the order taking cognizance of the alleged offence<lb/> dated 03.11.2017 (Annexure-Y). The only ground on<lb/> which the cognizance has been taken is that at that<lb/> stage allegation made in the complaint cannot be<lb/> brushed aside. This opinion seems to have been<lb/> formed<lb/> on the basis of the petitioners having<lb/> remitted fine to the Mines and Geology Department<lb/> for having stored the minor mineral extracted in the<lb/> adjacent Government land. On this basis, it cannot<lb/> be construed that there has been encroachment of<lb/> the Government land by the petitioners. In fact, the<lb/> report of the Assistant Commissioner dated<lb/> 25.10.2017 (Annexure-W), it has been clearly held<lb/> that there is no encroachment of Government land by<lb/> the petitioners. As such, on the facts obtained in the<lb/> instant case, it cannot be construed the order taking<lb/> cognizance of the offence is just and proper.<lb/></p>

			<p>154.1 For the reasons aforestated, we are of the<lb/> considered view that petitioner is entitled to the<lb/> reliefs sought for in the facts obtained in the present<lb/> case. Hence, writ petition is allowed. Order dated<lb/> 03.11.2017 (Annexure-Y) passed by the Special Court<lb/> in LGC(P)No.635/2017 is hereby quashed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.52972/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>155. Petitioners claim to have been granted<lb/> possession of 32 cents of land in Sy.No.192/1A3C<lb/> and 192/1A3E of Voderahobli village, Kundapur by<lb/> the Government vide order dated 04.12.1964.<lb/></p>

			<p>155.1 Proceedings under the impugned Act<lb/> has been initiated on the basis of complaint lodged by<lb/> jurisdictional Tahsildar on the ground that petitioner<lb/> has encroached upon the Government land. Record<lb/> on hand would indicate that there were several<lb/> correspondence<lb/> between<lb/> the<lb/> petitioners<lb/> and<lb/> respondent-authorities and on account of personal<lb/> hearing having not been extended to the petitioner to<lb/> demonstrate that no portion of Government land was<lb/> encroached, for reasons best known, same was not<lb/> extended. Hence, petitioners had approached this<lb/> Court in W.P.Nos.62974-975/2016 which came to be<lb/> disposed of on 20.06.2017 (Annexure-K) quashing<lb/> the order impugned therein and directing the<lb/> respondent-authorities to extend petitioners an<lb/> opportunity. Thereafter, an order came to be passed<lb/> on 14.11.2017 by second respondent by arriving at a<lb/> conclusion that the land bearing Sy.No192/1A3A1C<lb/> measuring 0.32 acres situated at Voderahobli village,<lb/> Kundapura taluk and the building constructed<lb/> thereon is by encroaching the land vested to the<lb/> Government and second respondent has called upon<lb/> the petitioners to hand over the building to the<lb/> custody of the Government. It is thereafter,<lb/> proceedings under the impugned Act has been<lb/> initiated.<lb/></p>

			<p>155.2 As to what is the extent of Government<lb/> land which is abutting the land which has been<lb/> granted to the petitioners and whether there is any<lb/> encroachment are all disputed questions of fact.<lb/> Said disputed questions of fact, cannot be gone into<lb/> by this court under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.53008/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>156. Petitioner claims to be the owner of the<lb/> land bearing Sy.No.218/1 situated at Badagamijar<lb/> village, Mangalore Taluk, D.K.District. It is alleged by<lb/> respondents that petitioner has occupied 15 cents of<lb/> Government land in Sy.No.218/1 to develop the<lb/> property belonging to her. In this regard, Tahsildar,<lb/> Moodabidre gave a complaint to the Special Court for<lb/> the offence punishable under Section 192A of<lb/> Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964.<lb/></p>

			<p>156.1 The Special Court is examining the said<lb/> issue with regard to encroachment.<lb/> The issue<lb/> involved in this writ petition relates to illegal<lb/> occupation of the Government land by the petitioner,<lb/> which is a disputed question of fact and same cannot<lb/> be gone into by this court under Article 226 and 227<lb/> of the Constitution of India and as such, the petition<lb/> is liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to<lb/> the constitutional validity urged in the writ petition<lb/> has already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.54035/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>157. Petitioner<lb/> entered<lb/> into<lb/> a<lb/> Joint<lb/> Development Agreement dated 12.06.2015 with the<lb/> owners of the property bearing Sy.No.36/1 and 36/2<lb/> of Ananthapura village, Yelahanka Hobli, Bangalore<lb/> North Taluk and it was converted for non-agricultural<lb/> residential purposes vide order dated 15.12.2011 and<lb/> 27.04.2010 respectively (Annexures-E and F).<lb/> subsequently, both properties were merged into one<lb/> by order dated 17.06.2014 and khata certificate was<lb/> accordingly issued.<lb/></p>

			<p>157.1 There was a pond in &apos;A&apos; Kharab land of<lb/> Sy.No.36/2, which was abutting the schedule<lb/> property as the same would make the property<lb/> unusable. The owners of the land also requested the<lb/> Deputy Commissioner to shift the drain to the<lb/> western side of the property so as to reach the drain<lb/> made by the BBMP. Subsequently, on matter being<lb/> referred to jurisdictional Tahsildar, survey was<lb/> conducted and by report dated 13.10.2014, the drain<lb/> was allowed to be shifted to south western side. In<lb/> fact, Tahsildar has also obtained no objection from<lb/> the villagers. Fourth respondent, after considering<lb/> the report of the Tahsildar, by order dated<lb/> 18.02.2015 allowed the shifting of the kharab land<lb/> which was existing in Sy.No.36/2 and half gunta in<lb/> Sy.No.36/5 towards south western side from North to<lb/> South in the remaining land of Sy.No.36/2. On<lb/> obtaining the sanctioned plan from BBMP, petitioner<lb/> is said to have commenced construction and at that<lb/> juncture, the communication dated 27.05.2016 came<lb/> to be issued by third respondent alleging<lb/> encroachment, which was challenged by the<lb/> petitioner in W.P.No.47296-297/2016 before this<lb/> Court and said notice has been stayed.<lb/></p>

			<p>157.2 On the advent of the impugned Act,<lb/> proceedings under the KLGP Act, 2011 has been<lb/> initiated<lb/> against<lb/> petitioner.<lb/> When<lb/> the<lb/> communication<lb/> dated<lb/> 27.05.2016<lb/> has<lb/> been<lb/> challenged by petitioner and same being pending in<lb/> W.P.No.47296-297/2016, question of proceeding<lb/> against petitioners under the KLGP Act-2011 does<lb/> not arise. In the event of petitioners succeeding in<lb/> the said writ petitions and simultaneously if the<lb/> petitioners are made to undergo the ordeal of trial<lb/> before the Special Court, it would definitely be<lb/> prejudicial to the interest of the petitioners. Hence,<lb/> we are of the considered view that till disposal of the<lb/> proceedings in the aforesaid writ petitions, the<lb/> present prosecution initiated against petitioner<lb/> cannot continue.<lb/> In other words, petitioner is<lb/> entitled to the relief sought for. However, we make it<lb/> clear that in the event of petitioners not succeeding in<lb/> the writ petition Nos.47296-297/2016, respondent-<lb/>authorities would be at liberty to initiate fresh<lb/> proceedings against petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>157.3 Subject to this observation, writ petition<lb/> is allowed and the proceedings pending before the<lb/> Special Court in LGC (S) 30/2017 (Annexure-B) is<lb/> hereby quashed.<lb/> RE: W.P.Nos.54081/2017 &amp; 54082/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>158. Petitioners claim that land bearing<lb/> Sy.No.33 measuring 81 acres situated at N.R.Pura<lb/> Taluk, Chikmagalur District, land bearing Sy.No.38<lb/> measuring 5 acres<lb/> and land bearing Sy.No.52<lb/> measuring 15 acres in Chikmagalur District, Koppa<lb/> Taluk of Devagudu village was granted in favour of<lb/> Sriyuths Abdul Rehman, Babar Pasha, Aurangzeb<lb/> and T.R.Shankarappa Hegde vide order dated<lb/> 29.01.1930, 1955, 30.12.1972 and 20.01.1960<lb/> respectively. The said property bearing Sy.No.33 was<lb/> said to have been settled in favour of two brothers<lb/> Auragzeb and Babar Pasha under a family settlement<lb/> deed dated 22.11.1957 and they constituted a<lb/> partnership firm and treated the said property as the<lb/> asset of partnership firm. It is stated that said firm<lb/> developed an estate called as &quot;Halasuru&quot; estate.<lb/> Under the deed of reconstituted firm, Smt.Malavika<lb/> Hegde is said to have joined the firm as incoming<lb/> partner and two brothers referred to supra have<lb/> retired from the firm.<lb/> The petitioners are said to<lb/> have inherited the property bearing Sy.No.38 and 52<lb/> referred to herein supra.<lb/></p>

			<p>158.1 In respect of aforesaid Sy.Nos., second<lb/> and third respondent respectively is said to have<lb/> made a report alleging encroachment and directing<lb/> the petitioners to hand over possession. Insofar as<lb/> Sy.No.38 and 52 are concerned, petitioners are said<lb/> to have handed over the land to the authorities after<lb/> survey and this is evident from the Mahazar dated<lb/> 16.01.2014 (Annexure-J in W.P.No.54082/2017).<lb/> However, insofar as Sy.No.33 is concerned, second<lb/> respondent by report dated 16.05.2014 (Annexure-F<lb/> in W.P.No.54081/2017) has alleged encroachment of<lb/> 122.17 acres and have directed the petitioner to<lb/> remove the encroachment.<lb/></p>

			<p>158.2 Undisputedly, an extent of 64 acres 39<lb/> guntas in Sy.No.38 &amp; 52 of Koppa Taluk, Devagudu<lb/> village which had been trespassed by the petitioner<lb/> has been handed over as evident from the mahazar<lb/> dated 16.01.2014 (Annexure-J). Hence, proceedings<lb/> initiated against petitioner in W.P.No.54082/2017<lb/> cannot be found fault with.<lb/></p>

			<p>158.3 Insofar as the land bearing Sy.No.33<lb/> wherein the authorities are contending the petitioner<lb/> has encroached to the extent of 122.17 acres is<lb/> concerned, the same has been denied by relying upon<lb/> the village map, tippani, grant certificate, GPS sketch,<lb/> etc. In fact, the fourth respondent by report dated<lb/> 19.07.2017 has stated that alleged encroached land<lb/> has been handed over from the possession of the<lb/> petitioner in W.P.No.54081/2017. Thus, as on the<lb/> date of initiation of proceedings, the encroachment<lb/> has stood proved and as such, the proceedings<lb/> against the petitioners cannot be found fault with.<lb/> Accordingly, both the writ petitions stand<lb/> dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.55683/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>159. Petitioners are said to have been granted<lb/> land measuring 20 acres 6 guntas in Sy.No.26 &amp; 27<lb/> of Kasavanahalli village, Varthur Hobli, Bangalore<lb/> South Taluk and delivered possession of it and as<lb/> such, petitioners are claiming to be in possession of<lb/> the said land. When the matter stood thus, the<lb/> Tahsildar passed an order on 19.06.2014 (Annexure-<lb/>J) stating that in Sy.No.27, a cart road of 20 feet wide<lb/> is encroached by petitioners and called upon the<lb/> petitioners to remove the encroachment. Challenging<lb/> the same, appeal was filed in 17/2016-17 before the<lb/> Assistant Commissioner and the order dated<lb/> 19.06.2014 has been stayed on 21.10.2017.<lb/></p>

			<p>159.1 Based on the order dated 19.06.2014,<lb/> the case was referred to BMTF which has initiated the<lb/> proceedings under Section 192A of the KLR Act and<lb/> charge sheet is filed in CC No.27045/2015, which<lb/> proceedings came to be transferred to the Special<lb/> Court on the introduction of the impugned Act and<lb/> said proceedings has been numbered as LGC(P)<lb/> 886/2017. On the basis of the complaint filed by the<lb/> second respondent herein, proceedings in LGC(P)<lb/> 224/2017 has been initiated against petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<p>159.2 As to whether petitioners have<lb/> encroached a cart track or otherwise, will have to be<lb/> examined by the appellate authority which is<lb/> adjudicating the Appeal No.17/2016-17. In the event<lb/> of present proceedings being continued against<lb/> petitioners and appellant succeeding before the<lb/> appellate authority, would definitely be onerous to<lb/> the petitioners to undergo the ordeal of trial. In the<lb/> fitness of the things, it would be apt and appropriate<lb/> to reserve liberty to respondents to initiate the<lb/> proceedings or the Special Court would be at liberty<lb/> to revive the proceedings initiated against petitioners<lb/> in the event of Appeal No.17/2016-17 pending before<lb/> Assistant Commissioner, Bangalore North Sub-<lb/>division being dismissed. Thus, for the present,<lb/> petitioners are entitled to the relief sought for.<lb/> Accordingly, writ petition is allowed. Proceedings<lb/> initiated in LGC(P)224/2017 and LGC(P)886/2017<lb/> stands quashed subject to observations made herein<lb/> above.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.56296/2017<lb/></p>

			<p>160. In this writ petition, proceedings have<lb/> been initiated against petitioner for alleged<lb/> encroachment of the land measuring 1 acre 15 cents<lb/> in Sy.No.22/2 situated at Chenankote village,<lb/> Virajpet Taluk, Kodagu District.<lb/> The mother of<lb/> petitioner had made an application on 10.10.1971 in<lb/> Form No.1 of the Karnataka Land Revenue<lb/> (Regularisation of Unauthorised Occupation of Lands)<lb/> Rules, 1970 for regularization of unauthorized<lb/> occupation of Government Paisari land and said<lb/> application is said to have not been disposed of.<lb/> Petitioner claims to have written to respondents time<lb/> and again seeking for regularization.<lb/></p>

			<p>160.1 In the light of proceedings pending and<lb/> contemplated with respect to lands defined under<lb/> clause (a) and (b) of proviso to clause (d) of Section 2,<lb/> we are of the considered view that present<lb/> proceedings against petitioner cannot be continued.<lb/> However, we make it clear that in the event of<lb/> application filed for regularization of unauthorized<lb/> occupation/cultivation has already been rejected or<lb/> on being rejected, respondent-authorities would be at<lb/> liberty to revive the present proceedings or initiate<lb/> fresh proceedings.<lb/> In that view of the matter,<lb/> petitioner succeeds and writ petition is allowed.<lb/> Summons dated 17.11.2017 issued to petitioner in<lb/> proceedings LGC(G) 1923/2017 pending on the file of<lb/> Special Court is quashed including the proceedings<lb/> initiated thereunder . In other words, Annexures-A<lb/> and A1 are quashed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.235/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>161. Petitioner claims to have purchased the<lb/> land under sale deed dated 22.11.2004 from one<lb/> Mr.Venkatappa and who is said to have purchased<lb/> the same under sale deed dated 11.10.1972. As to<lb/> whether the predecessor in title of the petitioner had<lb/> title to the said property is an issue which will have<lb/> to be resolved by the Special Court after evaluating<lb/> the evidence.<lb/></p>

			<p>161.1 The issue in this writ petition relates to<lb/> disputed question of fact, which cannot be gone into<lb/> by this court under Article 226 and 227 of the<lb/> Constitution of India and as such, the petition is<lb/> liable to be dismissed. The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in the writ petition has<lb/> already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.463/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>162. Petitioner claims that property bearing<lb/> Sy.No.52 of Herohalli village measuring 62.25 acres<lb/> out of which, cultivable land is 28.20 acres and the<lb/> rest 34.05 acres is &apos;A&apos; kharab land and the said<lb/> extent was granted in favour of Mr.M Gopalaswamy<lb/> Iyer in the year 1924-25 vide Land Grant Rules DC<lb/> No.394/24-25 dated 30.04.1924. It is further stated<lb/> that Sri A V Subramanyam sold 23.20 acres of<lb/> cultivable land in favour of petitioner and as such, it<lb/> became owner of the total extent of 54.20 acres,<lb/> which included cultivable and uncultivable land.<lb/> Though respondent No.2 herein has contended that<lb/> the documents relied upon by petitioner is false and<lb/> in collusion with revenue officials, records secured by<lb/> Special Court from the revenue authorities clearly<lb/> indicated that the Register of Index of Land Form<lb/> No.6 at page No.139 pertain to Sy.No.52 and subject<lb/> No.2 therein indicated that 28.20 acres of land was<lb/> granted to Sri Gopalaswamy Iyer namely, predecessor<lb/> in title of the petitioner. The Special Court also<lb/> observes that Index of land has reference to No.415<lb/> in the Record of Rights which also reflects the name<lb/> of Sri Gopalaswamy Iyer. On account of the age of<lb/> the records that is being more than 90 years old,<lb/> certain portions have been torn off.<lb/></p>

			<p>162.1 Apart from the above facts, it would also<lb/> emerge that proceedings for determination of surplus<lb/> land beyond the ceiling limit had been initiated before<lb/> the Land Tribunal, Bangalore North Taluk in LRF CR<lb/> No.2099/1974-75 and Tribunal had held that<lb/> petitioner herein possessed excess land of 265.24<lb/> acres including 52.35 acres of land in Sy.No.52/2 of<lb/> Herohalli village. Undisputedly, said order of land<lb/> Tribunal is now the subject matter of adjudication in<lb/> W.P.No.41866-70/2015<lb/> which<lb/> is<lb/> pending<lb/> consideration. Yet, the Special Court has proceeded<lb/> to continue the proceedings on the ground that<lb/> petitioner has failed to prove the ownership and title<lb/> over Sy.No.52. In view of the findings recorded by the<lb/> Special Court itself in paragraph 13 , 16 and 17,<lb/> finding recorded at paragraph No.18 pales to<lb/> insignificance.<lb/></p>

			<p>162.2 In that view of the matter, proceedings<lb/> initiated against petitioner cannot be continued.<lb/> Hence, we allow the writ petition and quash the<lb/> proceedings in LGC(P) 240/2016 pending before the<lb/> Special Court, Bengaluru.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.777/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>163. Petitioner claims to have acquired title to<lb/> the property bearing Sy.No.130/7 measuring 8<lb/> guntas situated at Kammasandra village, Attibele<lb/> Hobli, Anekal Taluk under registered sale deed dated<lb/> 27.07.2013 and the predecessor in title of the<lb/> petitioner had acquired the same under registered<lb/> sale deed dated 19.11.2007, by which time, the land<lb/> measuring was converted into non-agricultural<lb/> residential purposes. Petitioner entered into a Joint<lb/> Development Agreement dated 27.07.2013 with<lb/> Spectra Infrastructures in respect of Sy.No.130/6.<lb/></p>

			<p>163.1 Petitioner is said to have noticed<lb/> encroachment of Raja Kaluve by the neighbouring<lb/> land owner and as such, petitioner is said to have<lb/> submitted representation on 10.08.2016 to the Lake<lb/> Encroachment Committee. On the basis of the news<lb/> article, second respondent is said to have called upon<lb/> the jurisdictional Tahsildar to submit a report and a<lb/> report came to be submitted on 12.12.2016 stating<lb/> that petitioner and certain other persons have<lb/> encroached the Nala and same has been removed.<lb/></p>

			<p>163.2 In view of the fact that report dated<lb/> 12.12.2016 (Annexure-L) submitted by second<lb/> respondent clearly disclosing that in respect of Raja<lb/> Kaluve in Sy.Nos.9, 11, 12, 13, 129 &amp; 130 had been<lb/> encroached by the persons named therein, it cannot<lb/> be gainsaid by petitioner that proceedings initiated<lb/> against it ought to be quashed, that too, without<lb/> evaluating the evidence.<lb/> Primafacie<lb/> opinion<lb/> formed by the Special Court for taking cognizance of<lb/> the offence cannot be found fault with. We do not<lb/> find any good ground to entertain the petition and<lb/> hence, writ petition stands dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.1348/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>164. On a complaint filed by second<lb/> respondent alleging that property measuring 1 acre<lb/> in Sy.No.83/2 of Byatarayanapura has been a Raja<lb/> Kaluve/canal and as such, action is to be initiated<lb/> against petitioner, proceedings under KLGP Act-<lb/>2011 has been initiated against petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>164.1 As could be seen from the averments<lb/> made in the petition and the documents relied upon<lb/> thereon, second respondent having failed in all his<lb/> attempts to challenge the ownership and possession<lb/> of the land belonging to the petitioner, has filed the<lb/> complaint (Annexure-Z9) before the KLGP Special<lb/> Court which proceedings have been numbered as<lb/> LGC(P) 309/2017.<lb/> We say so for the reason that<lb/> petitioner claim title to the property by virtue of same<lb/> having been allotted to her under registered partition<lb/> deed dated 24.01.2002.<lb/> The survey sought for by<lb/> her was conducted after notifying second respondent<lb/> and hissa phodi was made and property belonging to<lb/> the petitioner assigned the number as 83/2 and the<lb/> land belonging to the second respondent and others<lb/> was assigned Sy.No.83/1.<lb/> It is thereafter on<lb/> 17.01.2005 petitioner got the land converted for<lb/> residential purposes.<lb/> After 7 years, second<lb/> respondent questioned the survey conducted in the<lb/> year 2004 by filing an appeal before the Deputy<lb/> Director of Survey Settlement, which came to be<lb/> dismissed on 21.03.2012 (Annexure-J). The revision<lb/> petition filed before the Deputy Commissioner was<lb/> dismissed by order dated 12.09.2013 (Annexure-K)<lb/> and the appeal filed in Appeal No.604/2014 before<lb/> the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal was withdrawn on<lb/> 19.02.2015 by second respondent.<lb/> However,<lb/> W.P.No.15395-98/2015 was filed challenging the<lb/> order dated 12.09.2013 passed by Deputy<lb/> Commissioner. Said writ petition was dismissed on<lb/> 23.01.2017 (Annexure-N). Thereafter petitioner has<lb/> filed two suits before the Civil Court and in the suit<lb/> O.S.No.3596/2015, the claim for grant of temporary<lb/> injunction was rejected. In fact, after the proceedings<lb/> before the Special Court was initiated by second<lb/> respondent, the BDA has submitted a report on<lb/> 29.05.2017<lb/> (Annexure-Z13)<lb/> clearly<lb/> stating<lb/> thereunder that it has not noticed any encroachment<lb/> of any public road or Raja Kaluve in Sy.No.83/2.<lb/> Even the Assistant Executive Engineer, BBMP by<lb/> report dated 19.07.2017 has clearly reported to the<lb/> Special Court that there is no existence of any Raja<lb/> Kaluve in Sy.No.83/2.<lb/> In the light of this<lb/> overwhelming evidence available on record, question<lb/> of continuation of proceedings would only be an<lb/> exercise in futility. In other words, petitioner is<lb/> entitled to the relief sought for. Hence, writ petition<lb/> is allowed. Proceedings pending in LGC(P)309/2017<lb/> before the KLGP Special Court stands quashed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.1395/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>165. Petitioner claims to be the owner of<lb/> converted land bearing Sy.No.60/2C, 61/C and<lb/> 62/1C of Hulimavu village. On the basis of an<lb/> application filed by father of petitioner, the Special<lb/> Deputy Commissioner, Bangalore District by order<lb/> dated 12.02.1985 (Annexure-E) has assigned 20<lb/> guntas of land in Sy.No.63 for the purpose of<lb/> formation of road under Section 71 of the Karnataka<lb/> Land Revenue Act, 1964.<lb/> On the ground that<lb/> petitioner has put up illegal construction on the said<lb/> road and not removed despite direction issued, a<lb/> complaint came to be lodged by the Tahsildar before<lb/> the Special Court. The Special Court by order dated<lb/> 07.08.2017 (Annexure-L) has opined that petitioner<lb/> has violated Section 4(1) and 4(2) of the KLGP Act-<lb/>2011.<lb/> When the order dated 12.02.1985 would<lb/> clearly indicate that it is an approach road from<lb/> Bangalore to Bannerghatta main road to the land<lb/> belonging to the petitioner, said road cannot be<lb/> encroached upon either by petitioner or any other<lb/> person. As to whether petitioner has put up any<lb/> sheds as alleged by Tahsildar is a matter which will<lb/> have to be examined after full fledged trial. At this<lb/> juncture, no opinion can be expressed on the basis of<lb/> affidavits of the parties. Hence, we are of the<lb/> considered view that petitioner is not entitled to the<lb/> relief sought for and petition is liable to be dismissed.<lb/> Accordingly, it is dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.3032/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>166. This petition is filed in the public interest<lb/> for declaring the KLGP Act-2011 contending that it is<lb/> not applicable to inam land and residential sites<lb/> within the village boundary, gramthana and to<lb/> consider the representation dated 09.11.2017<lb/> (Annexures-B &amp; C) submitted to respondents-1 and 2<lb/> for amending the notification No.RD3-MIN 58 dated<lb/> 13.01.1959 contending interalia that petitioners and<lb/> similarly placed persons are in possession of certain<lb/> extent of lands in Raghavanapalya village, J.P.Nagar<lb/> 9 th Phase, Gottigere post, Uttarahalli Hobli by way of<lb/> inheritance and have been living in the said lands<lb/> from number of years.<lb/></p>

			<p>166.1 While adjudicating challenge to the<lb/> constitutional validity of KLGP Act-2011, we have<lb/> made several observations, which we do hope the<lb/> State would be taking note of and remedial steps also<lb/> being taken. As such, acceding to the request of<lb/> petitioner to direct respondent<lb/> to consider<lb/> representation dated 09.11.2017 would not arise.<lb/> Insofar as constitutional validity of KLGP Act-2011 is<lb/> concerned, the same has been upheld and provisions<lb/> of Section 9(4), 9(5)(b) and 20 read with Section 2(d)<lb/> has been read down and this would suffice for<lb/> disposing of this writ petition. Accordingly, this writ<lb/> petition stands disposed of.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.3641/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>167. Petitioner claims to be owner of the lands<lb/> measuring 15 acres 20 guntas, 30 acres 14 guntas,<lb/> 28 acres, 20 guntas, 11 acres 27 guntas, 5 acres, 1<lb/> acre 24 guntas, 40 acres, 3 acres 35 guntas and 9<lb/> acres 14 guntas in Sy.Nos.21, 56/2, 56/1, 78, 88,<lb/> 98/2, 153, 74 and 75 respectively situated at<lb/> Magundi Village, Ennapura Taluk, Chikmangaluru<lb/> District.<lb/> On the ground that petitioner has<lb/> encroached about 51.21 acres of land third<lb/> respondent initiated proceedings, which resulted in<lb/> FIR 25/1999 being registered under Section 64-A of<lb/> Karnataka Forest Act, 1963. Appeal filed challenging<lb/> the same in Appeal No.37/2003 was dismissed. Writ<lb/> petition filed in W.P.No.3073/2006 yielded result<lb/> namely, writ petition was allowed and order dated<lb/> 19.03.2003 passed by the Deputy Conservator of<lb/> Forests and order dated 27.12.2005 passed by the<lb/> Conservator of Forests came to be set aside and<lb/> matter was remitted back to the authorities and it<lb/> was ordered that before initiating the proceedings<lb/> under Section 64-A joint survey should be held. It<lb/> was contended by the petitioner that survey<lb/> conducted was in his absence and thereafter the<lb/> Deputy Conservator of Forests is said to have passed<lb/> order afresh on 15.03.2016 holding that petitioner is<lb/> liable to be evicted from Sy.No.21 measuring 19 acres<lb/> of foret land, 13 acres which is alleged to be deemed<lb/> forest and 9.37 acres in Sy.No.56/5 of Magundi<lb/> Village. The appeal filed by the petitioner is said to be<lb/> pending before the Conservator of Forests in Appeal<lb/> No.2/2016.<lb/></p>

			<p>167.1<lb/> In the meanwhile, third respondent<lb/> filed a complaint before the Special Court alleging<lb/> encroachment of the lands by the petitioner as<lb/> indicated in the order dated 15.03.2016 passed by<lb/> the Deputy Conservator of Forests and cognizance<lb/> taken by the Special Court has been called in<lb/> question before this Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>167.2<lb/> When the appeal filed by the petitioner<lb/> is pending in Appeal No.2/2016 before the<lb/> Conservator of Forests, continuation of proceedings<lb/> before the Special Court would not arise. Only in the<lb/> event of the appeal being dismissed, the proceedings<lb/> before the Special Court can be proceeded. Hence,<lb/> we are of the view that it would be appropriate to<lb/> reserve liberty to respondents to revive the<lb/> proceedings before the Special Court on appeal being<lb/> dismissed.<lb/></p>

			<p>167.3<lb/> Accordingly, writ petition stands<lb/> allowed.<lb/> Proceedings before the Special Court at<lb/> Bengaluru in LGC (G) No.1879/2017 (Annexure-H)<lb/> i.e., order dated 14.09.2017 is quashed.<lb/></p>

			<p>W.P.No.4729/2018:<lb/></p>

			<p>168. Petitioners claims to be the absolute<lb/> owners of the property bearing Sy.No.61(old No.111)<lb/> contending interalia that same was granted on<lb/> 29.04.1931 in favour of Sri Chikkaiah<lb/> vide<lb/> Annexure-A<lb/> and petitioners are successors in<lb/> interest of the original grantee. It is stated that<lb/> revenue records stood in the name of petitioners&apos;<lb/> predecessors in title and by MR No.94-95, new<lb/> Sy.No.61 was assigned and revenue records were<lb/> mutated in the name of Sri Basavanna, first<lb/> petitioner&apos;s father in law and second petitioner&apos;s<lb/> father. The name of Sri Basavanna continue in the<lb/> revenue records till 2016-17 though he had expired<lb/> on 02.12.1977.<lb/> Hence, on the demise of first<lb/> petitioner&apos;s husband on 14.12.1990, first petitioner<lb/> as well as brother of her husband as successor of late<lb/> Sri Basavanna sought for revenue records being<lb/> mutated in their names. On the complaint filed by<lb/> one Sri Ravikumar against five officials, Tahsildar<lb/> conducted an enquiry and passed an order on<lb/> 29.07.2016 for transferring the name of the<lb/> petitioners in respect of Sy.No.61 measuring 22 acres<lb/> 20 guntas.<lb/></p>

			<p>168.1 Suo motu proceedings was initiated by<lb/> the Assistant Commissioner, Tiptur sub-division and<lb/> passed an order on 08.09.2016 (Annexure-J)<lb/> whereunder, order passed by Tahsildar for mutating<lb/> revenue records in the name of petitioners came to be<lb/> set aside and it was ordered to enter the name of<lb/> Government in respect of land bearing Sy.No.61<lb/> measuring 24 acres 20 guntas. Being aggrieved by<lb/> said order, writ petition was filed in W.P.No.50784-<lb/>785/2016, which came to be disposed of by reserving<lb/> liberty to the petitioners to file revision petition before<lb/> the<lb/> Deputy<lb/> Commissioner.<lb/> Accordingly,<lb/> R.P.No.81/2016-17 was filed assailing the order of<lb/> Assistant Commissioner and same is said to be<lb/> pending. In the meanwhile, present proceedings has<lb/> been initiated against petitioner under KLGP Act-<lb/>2011.<lb/></p>

			<p>168.2 It is not in dispute that order passed by<lb/> the Assistant Commissioner dated 08.09.2016 in<lb/> R.A.No.224/16-17 is pending adjudication before<lb/> Deputy Commissioner, Tiptur in R.P.No.81/2016-17<lb/> and interim order of stay is in operation. If the<lb/> proceedings before the Special Court were to continue<lb/> during the pendency of revision petition, it would<lb/> definitely cause undue hardship to petitioners and<lb/> they would be required to face the ordeal of trial. In<lb/> order to protect the interest of the State also, it would<lb/> be apt and appropriate to grant liberty to the<lb/> respondents to revive proceedings pending before<lb/> Special Court in LGC(P) No.1/2016 on disposal of the<lb/> revision petition before the Deputy Commissioner and<lb/> for the present, impugned order dated 28.11.2017<lb/> passed in LGC(P)No.1/2016 (Annexure-N) stands<lb/> quashed subject to liberty granted to respondents.<lb/> Accordingly, writ petition stands allowed.<lb/> RE:W.P.Nos.5389/2018, 5390/2018 &amp; 5391/2018<lb/> 169. Petitioners have sought for quashing of<lb/> the KLGP ACT-2011 and the proceedings initiated<lb/> against respective petitioners by Special Court<lb/> constituted under the impugned Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>169.1 Perusal of the averments made in the<lb/> petitions do not disclose as to the right claimed by<lb/> petitioners over the land bearing Sy.Nos.146.<lb/> Averments made in the writ petition do not disclose<lb/> as to how petitioners came in possession of said land.<lb/> On the other hand, in the complaint filed by<lb/> jurisdictional Tahsildar, it is contended that said<lb/> lands belong to the appropriate Government.<lb/></p>

			<p>169.2 The legal issues relating to the<lb/> constitutional validity urged in these writ petitions<lb/> have already been discussed in detail herein above.<lb/> Subject to the observations made on the legal issues<lb/> raised, these writ petitions stand dismissed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.5704/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>170. On the strength of a complaint filed by<lb/> first respondent alleging that lands in Sy.Nos.7 to 11<lb/> measuring about 279 acres of Peddanapalya village<lb/> had been endowed by Mrs.Dwarakabai Vedantam to<lb/> Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangapatna, has<lb/> been usurped by petitioner and 114 persons by<lb/> creating false records and land endowed to the<lb/> temple which became the property of temple and the<lb/> Government thereafter due to the advent of the<lb/> Mysore (Religious and Charitable) Inams Abolition<lb/> Act, 1955, proceedings under the KLGP Act-2011<lb/> has been initiated after taking cognizance of the<lb/> alleged offence.<lb/></p>

			<p>170.1<lb/> Report of the Tahsildar dated<lb/> 30.11.2016 filed before the Special Court which has<lb/> been taken note of by the Special Court at the time of<lb/> taking cognizance would indicate that after coming<lb/> into force of Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961<lb/> occupancy rights were granted by jurisdictional land<lb/> Tribunal and subsequently, alienations/sales have<lb/> taken place. RTC for the year 2016-17 produced by<lb/> the Tahsildar before Special Court also disclosed the<lb/> nature of rights acquired by various persons. The<lb/> Special Court at paragraph 21 of its order dated<lb/> 08.01.2018 has recorded a finding that there is no<lb/> dispute that all the inam lands covered under the<lb/> Inams Abolition Act, 1977 vested with the<lb/> Government from the appointed date. It is also<lb/> further noticed that with effect from 01.03.1974,<lb/> Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 coming into force,<lb/> all the tenanted lands vested with the Government.<lb/></p>

			<p>170.2 As to whether the Deputy Commissioner<lb/> could have re-granted the lands in favour of the<lb/> persons who were in occupation of the land has been<lb/> gone into by the Special Court and without setting<lb/> aside the order passed by the Special Deputy<lb/> Commissioner, the settled issues could not be re-<lb/>opened in a collateral proceedings like the KLGP Act-<lb/>2011. On the ground that there was no record to<lb/> show when the tenants entered the lands in question<lb/> and under what authority, contention raised by<lb/> petitioner and similarly placed persons has been<lb/> negatived by Special Court. In other words, the<lb/> Special Court is attempting to sit in judgment over<lb/> the orders passed by the Special Deputy<lb/> Commissioner under the Inams Abolition Act and<lb/> order passed by the jurisdictional land Tribunal<lb/> under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act by opining<lb/> that such an order would not have been passed. It<lb/> has been opined by the Special Court that &quot; perhaps,<lb/> the revenue authorities have committed the same<lb/> mistake at the time of making entries in the revenue<lb/> records. There is no entry in the mutation register at<lb/> any time in respect of these endowed lands in any<lb/> other revenue records showing the origin of these so<lb/> called inam lands.&quot;<lb/> Hence, it has arrived at a<lb/> conclusion that it was not an inam land. The filing of<lb/> applications by the occupiers of the land under the<lb/> Inams Abolition Act, 1955 has been virtually held as<lb/> one without jurisdiction. In other words, orders<lb/> passed by the authorities was held to be as one<lb/> without jurisdiction, for assuming jurisdiction under<lb/> the KLGP Act-2011. Hence, we are of the considered<lb/> view that Special Court committed an error in taking<lb/> cognizance on the basis of the mere allegations made<lb/> in the complaint and without there being any basis<lb/> for the same. Accordingly, we hold that petitioner is<lb/> entitled to the reliefs sought for. Writ petition stands<lb/> allowed and the proceedings pending in LGC<lb/> 43/2016 insofar as petitioner is concerned stands<lb/> quashed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.6061/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>171. The property bearing old Sy.No.8 of<lb/> Peddanapalya village, Tavarekere Hobli, Bangalore<lb/> South Taluk was under the tenure of Sri<lb/> Ranganathaswamy temple, Magadi.<lb/> One Sri<lb/> Muttaiah claiming to be the tenant and in occupation<lb/> and possession of the said land had filed an<lb/> application before the Land Tribunal, Magadi for<lb/> grant of occupancy rights. Land Tribunal, by order<lb/> dated 25.05.1992 (Annexure-E1) granted occupancy<lb/> rights to an extent of 3 acres 5 guntas. On account<lb/> of said order having not been challenged, it has<lb/> attained finality. The said person is said to have paid<lb/> the premium as evidenced from the endorsement<lb/> dated 10.02.1984 (Annexure-E2). Said property was<lb/> partitioned between Sri Muttaiah and his children.<lb/> Petitioner being one of the sons of Sri Muttaiah was<lb/> allotted the land measuring 1 acre 22 ½ guntas vide<lb/> registered partition dated 28.12.2011, on the basis of<lb/> which, revenue records came to be mutated.<lb/> A<lb/> complaint has been filed by second respondent before<lb/> the Special Court alleging encroachment of<lb/> Government land vide complaint dated 04.11.2016.<lb/></p>

			<p>171.1<lb/> In<lb/> the<lb/> connected<lb/> matter<lb/> i.e.,<lb/> W.P.No.5074/2018 which arises out of same order<lb/> passed by the Special Court i.e., dated 08.01.2018,<lb/> this Court has held:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Hence, we are of the<lb/> considered view that Special Court<lb/> committed an error in taking<lb/> cognizance on the basis of the mere<lb/> allegations made in the complaint<lb/> and without there being any basis<lb/> for the same. Accordingly, we hold<lb/> that petitioners are entitled to the<lb/> reliefs sought for.<lb/> Writ petition<lb/> stands allowed and the proceedings<lb/> pending in LGC 43/2016 insofar as<lb/> petitioner is concerned stands<lb/> quashed.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>171.2 In view of the above finding and facts in<lb/> the instant case being identical and similar, the<lb/> petitioner in the instant case is also entitled to the<lb/> relief sought for.<lb/></p>

			<p>171.3 Hence, writ petition is allowed and the<lb/> proceedings initiated against petitioner in LGC<lb/> 43/2016 before the Special Court stands quashed.<lb/> RE: W.P.No.6330/2018<lb/></p>

			<p>172. First petitioner&apos;s father claims to have<lb/> purchased a portion of the property carved out of<lb/> Sy.No.43<lb/> of<lb/> Sri<lb/> Gandhadakavalu<lb/> village,<lb/> Yeshwanthpur Hobli, Bangalore North Taluk under a<lb/> registered power of attorney dated 18.01.1981 for a<lb/> valuable consideration of Rs.15,000/-each. On the<lb/> death of first petitioner&apos;s father, petitioners claim to<lb/> have succeeded to the estate and they claim to be in<lb/> possession and enjoyment of said property.<lb/> It is<lb/> necessary to note at this juncture itself that sale<lb/> deeds have not been produced. Respondent filed a<lb/> complaint before Special Court alleging that<lb/> petitioners herein have grabbed 2 acres 14 guntas of<lb/> land in Sy.No.43/1 which measures more than 100<lb/> acres.<lb/> Report called for from the jurisdictional<lb/> Tahsildar from the Special Court and on being filed, it<lb/> was objected to by the complainant.<lb/> Assistant<lb/> Commissioner, Bangalore North Sub-division, as<lb/> directed by the Special Court made a spot inspection<lb/> and submitted a detailed report based upon which,<lb/> the cognizance has been taken. Said report disclosed<lb/> that Sy.No.43/1 measures 12 acres 3 guntas, out of<lb/> which, 32 guntas is comprised of &apos;B&apos; kharab. Said<lb/> land is said to have been taken over by the<lb/> Government, in pursuance to the order dated<lb/> 22.09.2015 passed under Section 67(5) of the<lb/> Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961.<lb/></p>

			<p>172.1 It is not in dispute that order passed by<lb/> the<lb/> land<lb/> Tribunal<lb/> has<lb/> been<lb/> stayed<lb/> in<lb/> W.P.No.41866/2016 c/w 42201/2016. Petitioners<lb/> are claiming under an unregistered sale deed title to<lb/> the property in question.<lb/> The issue in this writ<lb/> petition relates to disputed question of fact, which<lb/> cannot be gone into by this court under Article 226<lb/> and 227 of the Constitution of India and as such, the<lb/> petition is liable to be dismissed. The legal issues<lb/> relating to the constitutional validity urged in the writ<lb/> petition has already been discussed in detail herein<lb/> above. Subject to the observations made on the legal<lb/> issues raised, this petition stands dismissed.<lb/></p>

			<p>173. It is made clear that writ petitions at<lb/> Sl.Nos.1 to 55 have been individually dealt, since it<lb/> touches upon the various facets discussed by us on<lb/> the legal issues and we deem it proper to leave it to<lb/> the Special Court to deal with the remaining cases<lb/> which has not been dealt by us individually, by<lb/> taking into consideration the proposition of law<lb/> settled herein above and also answered in the writ<lb/> petitions referred to herein above, by adjudicating<lb/> each of the claim made in the respective individual<lb/> writ petitions and also in the background of proviso<lb/> to clause (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 9 of KLGP<lb/> Act-2011 and also in the light of Section 22 having<lb/> been inserted by Act 30 of 2020. Petitioners are at<lb/> liberty to file applications for dismissing the<lb/> complaint or dropping the proceedings pending<lb/> before the Special Court as they deem fit.<lb/></p>

			<p>174. It is needless to state that prayers made<lb/> by the petitioners in the remaining writ petitions<lb/> wherein, they have sought for dropping of the<lb/> proceedings would be considered by the Special<lb/> Court on such applications being filed in an<lb/> expeditious manner and till adjudication is<lb/> concluded, the interim orders passed by this court<lb/> preventing the authorities from demolition of the<lb/> buildings if any or taking possession of the land and<lb/> the like coercive steps proposed by the said<lb/> authorities, shall continue and shall be in operation.<lb/> We also make it clear that if any orders adverse<lb/> to the interest of the petitioners being passed by the<lb/> Special Court, they would be at liberty to approach<lb/> this court by filing appropriate petitions and urging<lb/> the grounds on facts only, since the issue regarding<lb/> constitutionality of the Act having been laid to rest.<lb/></p>
