			<lb />
			At the outset, it is necessary for this Court to have a brief
			<lb />
			background before indulging in analyzing the issue at hand.
			<lb />
			On 22.08.2019, Amazon entered into Shareholder and Share
			<lb />
			Subscription Agreements with Future Coupon Private Limited
			<lb />
			(FCPL). Through these instruments, Amazon intended to
			<lb />
			acquire 49% stake in FCPL. The aforesaid agreements
			<lb />
			contained an arbitration agreement, wherein parties resolved
			<lb />
			to settle their disputes in accordance with the Arbitration
			<lb />
			Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Center (SIAC).
			<lb />
			The parties had further resolved to have the seats at New
			<lb />
			Delhi.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			On 12.08.2019, FCPL and its promoters entered into a
			<lb />
			Shareholder Agreement with Future Retail Limited (FRL).
			<lb />
			Through this Agreement, FCPL was granted certain protective
			<lb />
			rights. One such right is produced as under:
			<lb />
			Clause 10 of SHA:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			10. TRANSFER OF RETAIL ASSETS
			<lb />
		</p>
		<list>
			<item>
				10.1 As of the Execution Date, the Company has
				<lb />
				set up an aggregate of at least 1,534 (one
				<lb />
				thousand five hundred and thirty four) retail
				<lb />
				outlets/formats including without limitation
				<lb />
				the Small Store formats across India and
				<lb />
				such retail outlets/stores are an integral part
				<lb />
				of the business conducted by the Company
				<lb />
				representing a significant and substantial
				<lb />
				part of the business conducted by the
				<lb />
				Company. The Existing Shareholders and
				<lb />
				the Company further agree, covenant and
				<lb />
				undertake to FCL that the Company shall be
				<lb />
				the sole vehicle for the conduct of such
				<lb />
				current business comprising of a widespread
				<lb />
				network of the retail outlets/formats
				<lb />
				including without limitation the Small Store
				<lb />
				formats that the Company has established
				<lb />
				and is operating
				<lb />
				across India and
				<lb />
				consequently such business shall continue
				<lb />
				to be an integral part of the Company&apos;s
				<lb />
				business.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.2 Accordingly, any sale, divestment, transfer,
				<lb />
				disposal, etc., of such retail outlets/ formats
				<lb />
				including without limitation the Small Store
				<lb />
				Formats shall be in accordance with this
				<lb />
				Agreement, and the company and the
				<lb />
				Existing
				<lb />
				shareholders
				<lb />
				covenant
				<lb />
				and
				<lb />
				undertake that during the subsistence of this
				<lb />
				Agreement, the company shall not transfer,
				<lb />
				or dispose off the Retail Assets except as
				<lb />
				otherwise mutually agreed between the
				<lb />
				Company, the Existing Shareholders and
				<lb />
				FCL in writing.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				10.3 Notwithstanding anything contained herein,
				<lb />
				the Company and the Existing Shareholders
				<lb />
				agree that the Retail Assets shall not be
				<lb />
				transferred,
				<lb />
				Encumbered
				<lb />
				divested,
				<lb />
				or
				<lb />
				disposed of, directly or indirectly, in favour of
				<lb />
				a Restricted Person.
				<lb />
			</item>
		</list>
		<p>
			There is no dispute that one of the restricted persons included
			<lb />
			the Reliance Group.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			As in March 2020, FRL submitted that there was business
			<lb />
			downturn due to Covid19 lockdowns as there were
			<lb />
			restrictions on retail sale through brickandmortar shops. In
			<lb />
			light of the same, the Board of FRL decided to sell, retail
			<lb />
			businesses and assets to Reliance, for a consideration in
			<lb />
			excess of Rs. 25,000 crores. Further, it is contended by FRL
			<lb />
			that there were outstanding loans of about Rs.20,000 crores
			<lb />
			with a serious and tangible risk of becoming insolvent. It is
			<lb />
			submitted that it was in this context that the subsequent
			<lb />
			transaction was entered into to alleviate its financial position
			<lb />
			and protect employment of around 25,000 employees of the
			<lb />
			Future Group.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			Aggrieved by the aforesaid sale transaction, Amazon initiated
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings before the SIAC. Amazon filed an
			<lb />
			application for emergency relief with the Registrar of the SIAC
			<lb />
			Court of Arbitration seeking interim prohibitory injunction to
			<lb />
			prevent FRL and FCPL from taking further steps in the
			<lb />
			aforesaid transaction with the Reliance Group. Parallelly, FRL
			<lb />
			filed a suit before the Delhi High Court registered as
			<lb />
			CS(COMM) No. 493 of 2020, against Amazon for tortious
			<lb />
			interference in the Scheme for the sale of assets.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			On 25.10.2020, the Emergency Arbitrator passed an Interim
			<lb />
			Award in favor of Amazon. It may be noticed that the
			<lb />
			Emergency Arbitrator and the Single Bench came to
			<lb />
			diametrically opposite conclusions which are juxtaposed
			<lb />
			herein below:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<figure type="table">
			Order of Emergency Arbitrator
			<lb />
			dated 25.10.2020
			<lb />
			Order of Single Judge Bench
			<lb />
			in I.A. No. 10376 of 2020 in
			<lb />
			CS(COMM) No. 493 of 2020
			<lb />
			dated 21.12.2020
			<lb />
			285. In the result, I award, direct,
			<lb />
			and order as follows:
			<lb />
			(a) the Respondents are
			<lb />
			injuncted from taking
			<lb />
			any steps in furtherance
			<lb />
			or in aid of the Board
			<lb />
			Resolution made by the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors or
			<lb />
			FRL on 29 August 2019
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			relation
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Disputed
			<lb />
			Transaction,
			<lb />
			including but not limited
			<lb />
			to filing or pursuing any
			<lb />
			application before any
			<lb />
			person,
			<lb />
			including
			<lb />
			regulatory
			<lb />
			bodies
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			agencies in India, or
			<lb />
			requesting for approval
			<lb />
			at any company meeting;
			<lb />
			(b) the Respondents are
			<lb />
			injuncted from taking
			<lb />
			any steps to complete
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Disputed
			<lb />
			Transaction with entities
			<lb />
			that are part of the MDA
			<lb />
			12.3 Thus the trinity of the
			<lb />
			principles for grant of interim
			<lb />
			injunction i.e. prima facie case,
			<lb />
			irreparable loss and balance of
			<lb />
			convenience are required to be
			<lb />
			tested in terms of principles as
			<lb />
			noted above. Since this Court
			<lb />
			has held that prima facie the
			<lb />
			representation
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Amazon
			<lb />
			based on the pea that the
			<lb />
			resolution dated 29 th August,
			<lb />
			2020 of FRL is void and that
			<lb />
			on conflation of the FCPL SHA
			<lb />
			and FRL SHA, the &apos;control&apos; that
			<lb />
			is sought to be asserted by
			<lb />
			Amazon on FRL is not
			<lb />
			permitted under the FEMA FDI
			<lb />
			Rules,
			<lb />
			without
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			governmental approvals, this
			<lb />
			Court finds that FRL has made
			<lb />
			out a prima facie case in its
			<lb />
			favour for grant of interim
			<lb />
			injunction. However, the main
			<lb />
			tests in the present case are in
			<lb />
			respect
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			&quot;balance
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Group;
			<lb />
			(c) without prejudice to the
			<lb />
			rights of any current
			<lb />
			Promoter Lenders, the
			<lb />
			Respondents
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			injuncted from directly
			<lb />
			or indirectly taking any
			<lb />
			steps
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			transfer/dispose/alienat
			<lb />
			e/encumber FRL&apos;s Retail
			<lb />
			Assets or the shares
			<lb />
			held in FRL by the
			<lb />
			Promoters
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			any
			<lb />
			manner
			<lb />
			without
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			prior written consent of
			<lb />
			the Claimant;
			<lb />
			(d) the Respondents are
			<lb />
			injuncted from issuing
			<lb />
			securities of FRL or
			<lb />
			obtaining/securing any
			<lb />
			financing, directly or
			<lb />
			indirectly,
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			any
			<lb />
			Restricted Person that
			<lb />
			will be in any manner
			<lb />
			contrary
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			Section
			<lb />
			13.3.1 of the FCPL SHA;
			<lb />
			(e) the orders in (a) to (d)
			<lb />
			above are to take effect
			<lb />
			immediately and will
			<lb />
			remain in place until
			<lb />
			further order from the
			<lb />
			Tribunal,
			<lb />
			when
			<lb />
			constituted; and
			<lb />
			(f)
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Claimant is
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			provide within 7 days
			<lb />
			from the date hereof a
			<lb />
			crossundertaking
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			damages
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Respondents.
			<lb />
			If the
			<lb />
			Parties are unable to
			<lb />
			agree on its terms, they
			<lb />
			convenience&quot; and &quot;irreparable
			<lb />
			loss&quot;. Even if a prima facie
			<lb />
			case is made out by FRL, the
			<lb />
			balance of convenience lies
			<lb />
			both in favour of FRL and
			<lb />
			Amazon. If the case of FRL is
			<lb />
			that the representation by
			<lb />
			Amazon to the statutory
			<lb />
			authorities/regulators is based
			<lb />
			on illegal premise, Amazon has
			<lb />
			also based its representation
			<lb />
			on alleged breach of FCPL SHA
			<lb />
			and FRL SHA, as also the
			<lb />
			directions in the EA order.
			<lb />
			Hence it cannot be said that
			<lb />
			the balance of convenience lies
			<lb />
			in favour of FRL and not in
			<lb />
			favour of Amazon. It would be
			<lb />
			a matter of trial after parties
			<lb />
			have led their evidence or if
			<lb />
			decided
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			any
			<lb />
			other
			<lb />
			competent forum to determine
			<lb />
			whether the representation of
			<lb />
			Amazon that the transaction
			<lb />
			between FRL and Reliance
			<lb />
			being in breach of the FCPL
			<lb />
			SHA and FRL SHA would
			<lb />
			outweigh the plea of FRL in the
			<lb />
			present suit. Further in case
			<lb />
			Amazon is not permitted to
			<lb />
			represent its case before the
			<lb />
			statutory
			<lb />
			authorities/Regulators, it will
			<lb />
			suffer an irreparable loss as
			<lb />
			Amazon also claims to have
			<lb />
			created preemptive rights in its
			<lb />
			favour in case the Indian law
			<lb />
			permitted in future. Further
			<lb />
			there may not be irreparable
			<lb />
			loss to FRL for the reason even
			<lb />
			if
			<lb />
			Amazon
			<lb />
			makes
			<lb />
			a
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			refer
			<lb />
			their
			<lb />
			differences to me qua EA
			<lb />
			for resolution; and
			<lb />
			(g) the
			<lb />
			costs
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			Application be part of
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			costs
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			Arbitration.
			<lb />
			representation
			<lb />
			based
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			incorrect facts thereby using
			<lb />
			unlawful means, it will be for
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			statutory
			<lb />
			authorities/Regulators
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			apply their mind to the facts
			<lb />
			and legal issues therein and
			<lb />
			come to the right conclusion.
			<lb />
			There is yet another aspect
			<lb />
			as to why no interim
			<lb />
			injunction can be granted in
			<lb />
			the present application for
			<lb />
			the reason both FRL and
			<lb />
			Amazon have already made
			<lb />
			their representations and
			<lb />
			counter representations to
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			statutory
			<lb />
			authorities/regulators
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			now it is for the Statutory
			<lb />
			Authorities/Regulators
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			take a decision thereon.
			<lb />
			Therefore, this Court finds
			<lb />
			that no case for grant of
			<lb />
			interim injunction is made
			<lb />
			out in favour of the FRL and
			<lb />
			against Amazon.
			<lb />
			13. Consequently,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			present application is disposed
			<lb />
			of, declining the grant of
			<lb />
			interim injunction as prayed
			<lb />
			for by FRL, however, the
			<lb />
			Statutory
			<lb />
			Authorities/Regulators
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			directed to take the decision on
			<lb />
			the applications/objections in
			<lb />
			accordance with law.

				against the respondent No.2; the order dated
				<lb />
				25th October, 2020 is not a nullity; the order

				Act. This Court is of the view that the order dated
				<lb />
				25th October, 2020 is appealable under Section
				<lb />
				37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. This
				<lb />
				Court is of the clear view that the order dated

				this Court under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration
				<lb />
				and Conciliation Act. The detailed reasons shall

				<lb />
				and shall file the status report with respect to the

				13. Again on 18.03.2021, the learned Single Judge in OMP (ENF)
				<lb />
				(COMM) No.17 of 2021, passed the 2 nd impugned order with
				<lb />
				aforesaid directions:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					&quot;188. The Emergency Arbitrator is an Arbitrator
					<lb />
					for all intents and purposes; order of the
					<lb />
					Emergency Arbitrator is an order under Section
					<lb />
					17(1) and enforceable as an order of this Court
					<lb />
					under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and
					<lb />
					Conciliation Act.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					…………
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					190. The respondents have raised a vague plea
					<lb />
					of Nullity without substantiating the same. The
					<lb />
					interim order of the Emergency Arbitrator is not a
					<lb />
					Nullity as alleged by respondent No.2.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					191. Combining/treating all the agreements as a
					<lb />
					single integrated transaction does not amount to
					<lb />
					control of the petitioner over FRL and therefore,
					<lb />
					the petitioner&apos;s investment does not violate any
					<lb />
					law.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					192. All the objections raised by the respondents
					<lb />
					are hereby rejected with cost of Rs.20,00,000/ to
					<lb />
					be deposited by the respondents with the Prime
					<lb />
					Minister Relief Fund for being used for providing
					<lb />
					COVID vaccination to the Below Poverty Line
					<lb />
					(BPL) category senior citizens of Delhi. The cost
					<lb />
					be deposited within a period of two weeks and the
					<lb />
					receipt be placed on record within one week of
					<lb />
					the deposit.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					193. The respondents have deliberately and
					<lb />
					wilfully violated the interim order dated 25th
					<lb />
					October, 2020 and are liable for the
					<lb />
					consequences enumerated in Order XXXIX Rule
					<lb />
					2A of the Code of Civil Procedure.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					194. In exercise of power under Order XXXIX
					<lb />
					Rule 2A(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the
					<lb />
					assets of respondents No.1 to 13 are hereby
					<lb />
					attached. Respondents No.1 to 13 are directed to

				14. In the interregnum, the FCPL and FRL approached the Division
				<lb />
				Bench of the Delhi High Court in FAO (OS) (COM) No.50 and
				<lb />
				51 of 2021 respectively against the 2 nd impugned order
				<lb />
				passed by the learned Single Judge which was stayed vide
				<lb />
				Order dated 22.03.2021.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				15. Subsequently, Amazon filed SLP (C) Nos. 61136114 of 2021
				<lb />
				before this Court against the order dated 22.03.2021 passed
				<lb />
				by the Division Bench of the High Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				16. This Court consolidated all the appeals filed by Amazon before
				<lb />
				this Court, heard the matters together and passed a final
				<lb />
				judgment dated 06.08.2021, answering only the following two
				<lb />
				legal questions:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					i. Whether an Emergency Arbitrator&apos;s Award can be
					<lb />
					said to be within the contemplation of the Arbitration
					<lb />
					Act?
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					ii. Whether an order passed under Section 17(2) of
					<lb />
					the Arbitration Act, in enforcement proceedings, is
					<lb />
					appealable under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act?
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				17. This Court answered the first question in the following
				<lb />
				manner:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					&quot;41. We, therefore, answer the first question by
					<lb />
					declaring that full party autonomy is given by the
					<lb />
					Arbitration Act to have a dispute decided in
					<lb />
					accordance with institutional rules which can
					<lb />
					include Emergency Arbitrators delivering interim
					<lb />
					orders, described as &quot;awards&quot;. Such orders are
					<lb />
					an important step in aid of decongesting the civil
					<lb />
					courts and affording expeditious interim relief to
					<lb />
					the parties. Such orders are referable to and are
					<lb />
					made under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration Act.&quot;
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				The second question was answered thus:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					&quot;76. The second question posed is thus answered
					<lb />
					declaring that no appeal lies under Section 37 of
					<lb />
					the Arbitration Act against an order of
					<lb />
					enforcement of an Emergency Arbitrator&apos;s order
					<lb />
					made under Section 17(2) of the Act. As a result,
					<lb />
					all interim orders of this Court stand vacated. The
					<lb />
					impugned judgments of the Division Bench, dated
					<lb />
					8th February, 2021 and 22nd March, 2021, are
					<lb />
					set aside. The appeals are disposed of
					<lb />
					accordingly.&quot;
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				18. It may be noted that this Court, in the aforesaid judgment of
				<lb />
				06.08.2021, did not adjudicate upon the merits of the case
				<lb />
				and limited its reasoning only to answer the legal questions
				<lb />
				which arose therein. On a reading of this judgment, the
				<lb />
				contention of the learned Senior Advocate Mr. Gopal
				<lb />
				Subramanium, that this Court has upheld the Emergency
				<lb />
				Arbitrator Award and did not interfere with the enforcement
				<lb />
				orders in OMP (ENF)(Comm.) No. 17 of 2021, on merits, is not
				<lb />
				correct. Although, the judgment narrates the facts leading up
				<lb />
				to the appeal, the Court neither returned any findings on
				<lb />
				facts, nor adjudicated on merits of the Order passed by
				<lb />
				Justice Midha in the enforcement proceedings. It is this gap
				<lb />
				which has led to the current round of litigation on merits of
				<lb />
				the case for the second time before this Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				19. In the meanwhile, FRL filed an application under Para 10 of
				<lb />
				Schedule 1 of the SIAC Rules for vacating the Award of the
				<lb />
				Emergency Arbitrator before the Arbitral Tribunal. The oral
				<lb />
				submissions on the vacate petitions were heard between 12 th
				<lb />
				16 th of July 2021 and orders were reserved.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				20. Contemporaneously, aggrieved by the merits of the orders of
				<lb />
				the Single Judge dated 02.02.2021 and 18.03.2021, FCPL and
				<lb />
				FRL preferred appeals directly before this Court in SLP (C) No.
				<lb />
				1354748 of 2021 and SLP (C) No. 1355657 of 2021,
				<lb />
				respectively. On 09.09.2021 the following interim order was
				<lb />
				passed by this Court:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					&quot;Heard learned senior counsel for the
					<lb />
					parties at length and carefully perused the
					<lb />
					material placed on record.
					<lb />
					Issue notice.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					Taking
					<lb />
					into
					<lb />
					consideration
					<lb />
					the
					<lb />
					submissions advanced by the learned senior
					<lb />
					counsel for the parties and particularly the
					<lb />
					fact that the parties have approached the
					<lb />
					Singapore International Arbitration Centre for
					<lb />
					vacating the Emergency Award passed by the
					<lb />
					Emergency Arbitrator and the arguments in
					<lb />
					the said matter have been ssconcluded and
					<lb />
					the order is going to be pronounced shortly,
					<lb />
					we think it fit to balance the interest of both the
					<lb />
					parties by staying all further proceedings before
					<lb />
					the Delhi High Court for the time being. Ordered
					<lb />
					accordingly. We further direct to all the
					<lb />
					authorities i.e. NCLT, CCI and SEBI not to
					<lb />
					pass any final order for a period of four weeks
					<lb />
					from today. This order has been passed with
					<lb />
					the consent of both the parties.
					<lb />
					List these matters after four weeks.&quot;
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(Emphasis supplied)
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				21. Thereafter, the applications filed by FRL and FCPL for vacating
				<lb />
				the award of the Emergency Arbitrator was dismissed by the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal by Order dated 21.10.2021.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				22. The aforesaid order of the Arbitral Tribunal, rejecting the
				<lb />
				vacate petition, was challenged by FCPL and FRL before the
				<lb />
				Delhi High Court in Arb. Pet. No. 63 of 2021 and Arb. Pet. No.
				<lb />
				64 of 2021. In Arb. Pet. No. 64 of 2021, FRL had filed IA No.
				<lb />
				14285/2021, seeking the following prayers:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					a. Stay the operation of the impugned Order dated
					<lb />
					21.10.2021 passed by the Hon&apos;ble Arbitral Tribunal.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					b. Alternatively, pass an order allowing the Appellant
					<lb />
					to take steps pursuing the scheme, subject to the
					<lb />
					condition that it shall not invite the passing of any
					<lb />
					final orders of approval of the scheme by the NCLT.
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				23. While issuing notice in both matters, by orders dated
				<lb />
				29.10.2021 (3 rd impugned Order), the Delhi High Court
				<lb />
				(Justice Suresh Kumar Kait) refused any immediate relief to
				<lb />
				FRL in the following words:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					&quot;15. During the course of hearing, this Court
					<lb />
					time and again referred that when the subject
					<lb />
					matter of this appeal is pending subjudice
					<lb />
					before the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Special
					<lb />
					Leave Petition (Civil) No. 13547 48/2021 and
					<lb />
					infact, by virtue of order dated 09.09.2021
					<lb />
					proceedings before this Court have been stayed
					<lb />
					and also directions have been passed to NCLT,
					<lb />
					CCI, SEBI to not pass any final order, then how
					<lb />
					interim relief, that too without therebeing any
					<lb />
					hearing or any reply from side opposite on
					<lb />
					record, application for interim stay can be heard
					<lb />
					and orders be passed. Upon this, Mr. Harish
					<lb />
					Salve, learned senior counsel submitted in such
					<lb />
					eventuality, this Court may dismiss the
					<lb />
					application.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					16. In view of the above, the application seeking
					<lb />
					interim stay being IA No. 14285/2021 (u/S 151
					<lb />
					CPC) is accordingly dismissed.&quot;
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				24. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, FCPL and FRL have
				<lb />
				approached this Court in SLP (C) Nos. 18089 and 18080 of
				<lb />
				2021 respectively.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				25. Mr. Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel appearing for FRL
				<lb />
				submitted that the orders in the enforcement proceedings have
				<lb />
				been rendered while completely disregarding the order dated
				<lb />
				21.12.2020 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi
				<lb />
				High Court in CS(Comm) No. 493 of 2020, particularly, the
				<lb />
				finding that FRL does not have any arbitration agreement with
				<lb />
				the respondent. He further submitted that although an appeal
				<lb />
				has been filed against the aforesaid order of the learned Single
				<lb />
				Judge, there is no stay operating against the said order.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				26. The learned Senior counsel also submitted that the impugned
				<lb />
				orders passed in the enforcement proceedings merit setting
				<lb />
				aside as the said proceedings have been conducted contrary to
				<lb />
				the principles of natural justice. He submitted that the
				<lb />
				procedure adopted has caused serious prejudice to the
				<lb />
				appellants as, after denying them an opportunity to file a reply
				<lb />
				affidavit, the impugned orders in the Enforcement proceedings
				<lb />
				recorded that FRL had not made any plea on the issue as to
				<lb />
				why were the orders of the Emergency Arbitrator a nullity.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				27. Thirdly, the learned Senior counsel contended that the
				<lb />
				impugned orders passed in the Enforcement proceedings
				<lb />
				extended beyond the scope of the Emergency Arbitrator&apos;s
				<lb />
				interim Award, by directing recall of the approvals granted by
				<lb />
				the Statutory Authorities.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				28. Lastly, while relying upon the Singapore Arbitration Rules,
				<lb />
				learned Senior counsel submitted that the Tribunal&apos;s interim
				<lb />
				order dated 21.10.2021, overrides the Emergency Arbitrator&apos;s
				<lb />
				interim Award which are the subject matter of the impugned
				<lb />
				enforcement proceedings. As a result, the enforcement
				<lb />
				proceedings and the impugned order have lost their relevance
				<lb />
				due to the subsequent events.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				29. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
				<lb />
				FCPL and their promoters, while supplementing the
				<lb />
				submissions of Mr. Salve, specifically contended that the
				<lb />
				impugned order merits setting aside due to grave injustice
				<lb />
				caused to the appellants due to the principles of natural
				<lb />
				justice being given a goby. No opportunity was granted for
				<lb />
				filing of any response which has resulted in various factual
				<lb />
				and legal errors creeping in the impugned order. He further
				<lb />
				submitted that considering the procedure followed by it, the
				<lb />
				penal orders passed by the High Court in the impugned order,
				<lb />
				merit a reconsideration.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				30. Learned Senior counsel further submitted that no prejudice
				<lb />
				would be caused to Amazon by setting aside the impugned
				<lb />
				order passed in the enforcement proceedings or by the passing
				<lb />
				of an interim measure allowing continuation of the
				<lb />
				proceedings before the NCLT. In fact, this Court, vide order
				<lb />
				dated 22.02.2021, has already created an interim arrangement
				<lb />
				by allowing the NCLT proceedings to continue with a direction
				<lb />
				to the NCLT not to pass any final order. On the other hand,
				<lb />
				the impugned order dated 18.03.2021, directed recall of the
				<lb />
				approvals granted by the statutory authorities.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				31. Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel appearing
				<lb />
				for Amazon, submitted that the appellants, by their conduct
				<lb />
				have demonstrated willful and intentional disobedience of the
				<lb />
				Emergency Arbitrator&apos;s interim Award, after agreeing for the
				<lb />
				Emergency Arbitrator. While he fairly stated that Amazon is
				<lb />
				not interested in pursuing the punitive directions imposed on
				<lb />
				FCPL and others, he submitted that the Emergency
				<lb />
				Arbitrator&apos;s interim Award stands confirmed by the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal, which must be abided by the appellants. Learned
				<lb />
				Counsel argued that when no stay has been granted against
				<lb />
				the interim protection afforded to them by the Arbitral
				<lb />
				Tribunal, the appellants cannot operate in contravention of the
				<lb />
				same and proceed to effectuate the scheme before the NCLT.
				<lb />
				He lastly submitted that pending any challenge, the interim
				<lb />
				orders passed by the Tribunal needs to be maintained and
				<lb />
				given effect to, so as to uphold the effectiveness and sanctity of
				<lb />
				the arbitration process.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				32. Mr. Aspi Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
				<lb />
				Amazon contended that the appellants&apos; reliance on the order
				<lb />
				dated 21.12.20, passed by the learned Single Judge of the
				<lb />
				Delhi High Court in the suit proceeding is misplaced. He
				<lb />
				submitted that, in the first instance, the suit instituted by FRL
				<lb />
				before the Delhi High Court was of the nature of an anti
				<lb />
				arbitration suit and a collateral challenge to the arbitration
				<lb />
				proceedings which is in contravention to Section 5 of the
				<lb />
				Arbitration Act. He further submitted that the observations
				<lb />
				being relied upon by the appellants were made in an order
				<lb />
				declining the relief sought by them before the Delhi High
				<lb />
				Court. Finally, the learned Senior counsel submitted that no
				<lb />
				relief should be granted to the appellants by this Court as they
				<lb />
				have not approached this Court with clean hands having failed
				<lb />
				to comply with any judicial order that has been passed.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				33. Having heard learned counsel for both the parties and on
				<lb />
				perusing voluminous documents submitted before the Court,
				<lb />
				the following questions arise for our consideration :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					I. Whether the orders dated 02.02.2021 and 18.03.2021,
					<lb />
					passed by the learned Single Judge in OMP (ENF) (COM)
					<lb />
					No.17 of 2021, are valid in law?
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					II. Whether the orders dated 29.10.2021, passed by the
					<lb />
					learned Single Judge in Arb. A (Comm.) No. 64 and 63 of
					<lb />
					2021, is valid in law?
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<head>
				Question No. I
				<lb />
			</head>
			<p>
				34. The orders of the learned Single Judge [Justice Midha] in OMP
				<lb />
				(ENF) (COMM) No.17 of 2021, is impugned on the grounds of
				<lb />
				lack of an opportunity granted to FCPL and FRL to file a
				<lb />
				counter to establish their defense. Mr. Rohatgi, learned Senior
				<lb />
				Advocate appearing on behalf of FCPL and its promoters has
				<lb />
				submitted that no time was granted by the learned Single
				<lb />
				Judge to respond. He added that a 200page order has been
				<lb />
				passed without any reply being filed on record and holding
				<lb />
				everyone guilty of contempt of court. He has further submitted
				<lb />
				that punitive directions could not have been passed even in
				<lb />
				contempt jurisdiction without affording the party a proper
				<lb />
				opportunity of filing a reply.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				35. In this context, our attention has been drawn to a catena of
				<lb />
				procedural orders passed by the High Court in OMP (ENF)
				<lb />
				(COMM) No.17 of 2021. From the record, we observe that FRL
				<lb />
				and FCPL were not provided sufficient time or opportunity to
				<lb />
				file their counter or raise their defense. On 29.01.2021, they
				<lb />
				were allowed to file a brief note of submission within twenty
				<lb />
				four hours, before orders were passed on 02.02.2021.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				36. On a perusal of the orders, we find that serious procedural
				<lb />
				errors were committed by the learned Single Judge. Natural
				<lb />
				justice is an important facet of a judicial review. Providing
				<lb />
				effective natural justice to affected parties, before a decision is
				<lb />
				taken, is necessary to maintain the Rule of law. Natural justice
				<lb />
				is usually discussed in the context of administrative actions,
				<lb />
				wherein procedural requirement of a fair hearing is read in to
				<lb />
				ensure that no injustice is caused. When it comes to judicial
				<lb />
				review, the natural justice principle is built into the rules and
				<lb />
				procedures of the Court, which are expected to be followed
				<lb />
				meticulously to ensure that highest standards of fairness are
				<lb />
				afforded to the parties.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				37. It is well known that natural justice is the sworn enemy of
				<lb />
				unfairness. It is expected of the Courts to be cautious and
				<lb />
				afford a reasonable opportunity to parties, especially in
				<lb />
				commercial matters having a serious impact on the economy
				<lb />
				and employment of thousands of people. Coming to the facts
				<lb />
				herein, the opportunity provided to the appellants herein was
				<lb />
				insufficient, and cannot be upheld in the eyes of law.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				38. Whenever an order is struck down as invalid being in violation
				<lb />
				of the principles of natural justice, there is no final decision of
				<lb />
				the case and fresh proceedings are left open. All that is done is
				<lb />
				to vacate the order assailed by virtue of its inherent defect.
				<lb />
				Such proceedings are not terminated and are usually remitted
				<lb />
				back. [See Canara Bank v. Debasis Das, (2003) 4 SCC 557]
				<lb />
				However, in this case, much water has flown under the bridge,
				<lb />
				since the passing of the order by the learned Single Judge,
				<lb />
				which has now been rendered redundant, for the following
				<lb />
				reasons :
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					 Initially, this Court by order dated 22.02.2021, had
					<lb />
					allowed proceedings to continue before the NCLT without
					<lb />
					finalization of the scheme.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					 Thereafter, learned Single Judge passed the 2 nd
					<lb />
					impugned order on 18.03.2021, without considering the
					<lb />
					order of this Court dated 22.02.2021.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					 Subsequently, the Division Bench in FAO (OS)(COM) No.
					<lb />
					50 and 51 of 2021, had stayed the aforesaid order of the
					<lb />
					Single Judge, which was taken in appeal again before
					<lb />
					this Court.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					 This Court finally disposed of the case, answering only
					<lb />
					two legal questions, without adjudicating on the merits of
					<lb />
					the matter.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					 In the meanwhile, FRL and FCPL had moved the Arbitral
					<lb />
					Tribunal, for vacating the interim injunction granted by
					<lb />
					the Emergency Arbitrator.
					<lb />
				</item>

					 In view of the pendency of the aforesaid application
					<lb />
					before the Arbitral Tribunal, this Court again through
					<lb />
					interim order dated 09.09.2021, allowed continuation of
					<lb />
					proceedings before the NCLT, without final authorization
					<lb />
					on the scheme.
					<lb />
				</item>

			<p>
				39. One aspect which may be highlighted is the punitive directions
				<lb />
				ordered by the learned Single Judge in the order dated
				<lb />
				18.03.2021, which are extracted below:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					&quot;192. All the objections raised by the
					<lb />
					respondents are hereby rejected with cost of
					<lb />
					Rs.20,00,000/ to be deposited by the
					<lb />
					respondents with the Prime Minister Relief
					<lb />
					Fund for being used for providing COVID
					<lb />
					vaccination to the Below Poverty Line (BPL)
					<lb />
					category senior citizens of Delhi. The cost be
					<lb />
					deposited within a period of two weeks and
					<lb />
					the receipt be placed on record within one
					<lb />
					week of the deposit.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					193. The respondents have deliberately and
					<lb />
					wilfully violated the interim order dated 25th
					<lb />
					October, 2020 and are liable for the
					<lb />
					consequences enumerated in Order XXXIX
					<lb />
					Rule 2A of the Code of Civil Procedure.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					194. In exercise of power under Order XXXIX
					<lb />
					Rule 2A(1) of the Code, the assets of the
					<lb />
					respondents No.1 to 13 are hereby attached.
					<lb />
					Respondents No. 1 to 13 are directed to file
					<lb />
					an affidavit of their assets as on today in
					<lb />
					Form 16A, Appendix E under Order XXI Rule
					<lb />
					41(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure within 30
					<lb />
					days. Respondent No. 1, 2, 12 and 13 are
					<lb />
					directed to file an additional affidavit in the
					<lb />
					format of Annexure B1 and respondents no.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					3 to 11 are directed to file an additional
					<lb />
					affidavit in the format of Annexure A1 to the
					<lb />
					judgment of M/s. Bhandari Engineers &amp;
					<lb />
					Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. Maharia Raj
					<lb />
					Joint Venture, (supra) along with the
					<lb />
					documents mentioned therein within 30
					<lb />
					days.&quot;
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				40. Our attention is drawn to the fact that the learned Single
				<lb />
				Judge had relied on M/s. Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders
				<lb />
				Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. Maharia Raj Joint Venture, 2019 SCC
				<lb />
				Online Del. 11879, which has been overruled by a Division
				<lb />
				Bench order in Delhi Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works
				<lb />
				Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Himgiri Realtors Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr., EFA
				<lb />
				(OS) (Comm.) No. 4 of 2021.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				41. Viewed differently, contempt of a civil nature can be made out
				<lb />
				under Order XXXIX Rule 2A CPC not when there has been
				<lb />
				mere &quot;disobedience&quot;, but only when there has been &quot;wilful
				<lb />
				disobedience&quot;. The allegation of wilful disobedience being in
				<lb />
				the nature of criminal liability, the same has to be proved to
				<lb />
				the satisfaction of the court that the disobedience was not
				<lb />
				mere &quot;disobedience&quot; but &quot;wilful&quot; and &quot;conscious&quot;. This Court
				<lb />
				in the case of Ram Kishan v. Tarun Bajaj, (2014) 16 SCC
				<lb />
				204, considering the implication of exercise of contempt
				<lb />
				jurisdiction, held that the power must be exercised with
				<lb />
				caution rather than on mere probabilities. While delineating
				<lb />
				the conduct which can be held to be &quot;wilful disobedience&quot;, this
				<lb />
				Court held that:
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					&quot;12. Thus, in order to punish a contemnor, it
					<lb />
					has to be established that disobedience of the
					<lb />
					order is &quot;wilful&quot;. The word &quot;wilful&quot; introduces a
					<lb />
					mental element and hence, requires looking
					<lb />
					into the mind of a person/contemnor by
					<lb />
					gauging his actions, which is an indication of
					<lb />
					one&apos;s state of mind. &quot;Wilful&quot; means knowingly
					<lb />
					intentional,
					<lb />
					conscious,
					<lb />
					calculated
					<lb />
					and
					<lb />
					deliberate with full knowledge of consequences
					<lb />
					flowing therefrom. It excludes casual,
					<lb />
					accidental, bona fide or unintentional acts or
					<lb />
					genuine inability. Wilful acts does not
					<lb />
					encompass involuntarily or negligent actions.
					<lb />
					The act has to be done with a &quot;bad purpose or
					<lb />
					without justifiable excuse or stubbornly,
					<lb />
					obstinately or perversely&quot;. Wilful act is to be
					<lb />
					distinguished from an act done carelessly,
					<lb />
					thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently. It
					<lb />
					does not include any act done negligently or
					<lb />
					involuntarily. The deliberate conduct of a
					<lb />
					person means that he knows what he is doing
					<lb />
					and intends to do the same. Therefore, there
					<lb />
					has to be a calculated action with evil
					<lb />
					motive on his part. Even if there is a
					<lb />
					disobedience of an order, but such
					<lb />
					disobedience is the result of some
					<lb />
					compelling circumstances under which it
					<lb />
					was not possible for the contemnor to
					<lb />
					comply with the order, the contemnor
					<lb />
					cannot
					<lb />
					be
					<lb />
					punished.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					&quot;Committal
					<lb />
					or
					<lb />
					sequestration will not be ordered unless
					<lb />
					contempt involves a degree of default or
					<lb />
					misconduct.&quot;
					<lb />

				42. Considering the fact that in the suit instituted by FRL, the
				<lb />
				learned Single Judge had earlier allowed FRL and Amazon to
				<lb />
				continue their pursuit before various regulatory authorities,
				<lb />
				and in view of the interim orders of this Court dated
				<lb />
				22.02.2021 and 09.09.2021, and the Courts below, we are
				<lb />
				inclined to setaside aforesaid directions as the precondition
				<lb />
				of &apos;sufficient mental element for wilful disobedience&apos; is not
				<lb />
				satisfied. Moreover, Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior
				<lb />
				Advocate appearing for Amazon, has fairly stated that Amazon
				<lb />
				is not interested in proceeding with the punitive directions.
				<lb />
				Taking note of the aforesaid submission, we set aside the
				<lb />
				punitive directions issued in the impugned orders of learned
				<lb />
				Single Judge dated 02.02.2021 and 18.03.2021.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				43. Coming to the merits of the case, we would like to mention a
				<lb />
				disconcerting aspect wherein the interim order enforcing the
				<lb />
				Emergency Award has adopted a standard beyond &apos;prima facie
				<lb />
				view&apos;, as required under law. It is expected of Courts to be
				<lb />
				cautious while making observations on the merits of the case,
				<lb />
				which would inevitably influence the Arbitral Tribunals
				<lb />
				hearing the matters on merit.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				44. Therefore, we set aside the order of the learned Single Judge
				<lb />
				dated 02.02.2021 and 18.03.2021 passed in OMP (ENF)
				<lb />
				(COMM.) No.17 of 2021.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<head>
				Question No. II
				<lb />
			</head>
			<p>
				45. At the outset, it is agreed by learned advocates appearing on
				<lb />
				both side that the impugned order dated 29.10.2021 in IA No.
				<lb />
				14285/2021 moved in Arb. A (Comm.) No. 64 of 2021, needs
				<lb />
				to be set aside for nonconsideration of the orders of this
				<lb />
				Court in the proper perspective. Our order dated 09.09.2021,
				<lb />
				imposed no bar on the High Court to adjudicate the issue
				<lb />
				concerning legality of the vacate application order by the
				<lb />
				Arbitral Tribunal. In our opinion, adjudication of the
				<lb />
				applications under Section 37(2), Arbitration Act filed by the
				<lb />
				appellants before the Delhi High Court are distinct from the
				<lb />
				earlier appeals filed before this Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				46. Further, certain important questions of law concerning the
				<lb />
				effect of the award of an Emergency Arbitrator and the
				<lb />
				jurisdiction of an Arbitral Tribunal qua such awards arise in
				<lb />
				the present matter. Therefore, these matters need to be
				<lb />
				remitted back for adjudication on its own merits.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				47. In view of the above, we order:
