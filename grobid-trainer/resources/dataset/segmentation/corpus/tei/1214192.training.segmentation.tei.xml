			JUDGMENT (PER K.R. SHRIRAM, J.) :
			<lb />
			WRIT PETITION NO.1334 OF 2021
			<lb />
		</front>
		<body>
			1
			<lb />
			This writ petition, along with other writ petitions listed today,
			<lb />
			have been filed by various assessees to challenge initiation of assessment
			<lb />
			proceedings under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) for
			<lb />
			different assessment years. All notices in these petitions for initiation of
			<lb />
			assessment proceedings have been issued after 1 st April 2021.
			<lb />
			2
			<lb />
			Since substantial questions of law were involved, interim
			<lb />
			protection has been granted. Revenue has also filed reply in many petitions
			<lb />
			and many petitioners have also filed rejoinder. Since issues were identical,
			<lb />
			we did not insist on the Revenue filing a reply in each of the petitions.
			<lb />
			3
			<lb />
			The cause of action of dispute arising in all these writ petitions
			<lb />
			purely being legal, i.e., on the validity of the assessment proceedings
			<lb />
			initiated against assessees after 1 st April 2021 under the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Act, as it existed before 1 st April 2021, read with the Taxation and Other
			<lb />
			Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020 (the
			<lb />
			Relaxation Act) and the notifications issued thereunder, the peculiar facts or
			<lb />
			pleadings of each case, in our view, are not material to the adjudication of
			<lb />
			the issues involved.
			<lb />
			4
			<lb />
			We have heard the counsels led by Mr. Mistri, Mr. Pardiwalla,
			<lb />
			Mr. Andhyarujina and Mr. Chatterji for petitioners and Mr. Anil Singh,

			Assessing Officer, if he had reason to believe that any income chargeable to
			<lb />
			tax had escaped assessment for any assessment year, he could, subject to the
			<lb />
			provisions of Sections 148 to 153 of the Act, assess or reassess such income
			<lb />
			and also any other income chargeable to tax which had escaped assessment.
			<lb />
			As per Section 148 of the Act, before making such assessment or
			<lb />
			reassessment under Section 147 of the Act, the Assessing Officer had to
			<lb />
			serve a notice on the assessee requiring him to furnish the return of his
			<lb />
			income. Sub-section (2) of Section 148 provided that the Assessing Officer
			<lb />
			shall, before issuing any notice, record his reasons for doing so.
			<lb />
			7
			<lb />
			As per sub-section (1) of Section 149 read with Section 147 of
			<lb />
			the Act, if the assessment has been completed under Section 143(3) of the
			<lb />
			Act, no notice under Section 148 of the Act could be issued beyond a period
			<lb />
			of four years from the end of relevant assessment year unless the income
			<lb />
			chargeable to tax had escaped assessment for the reason of the failure on
			<lb />
			the part of the assessee to disclose truly and fully all material facts necessary
			<lb />
			for assessment and in any case, no such notice could be issued beyond a
			<lb />
			period of six years from the end of relevant assessment year.
			<lb />
			8
			<lb />
			Section 151 of the Act pertained to sanction for issuance of
			<lb />
			notice. Sub-section (1) of Section 151 of the Act provides that no such
			<lb />
			notice could be issued under Section 148 of the Act by the Assessing Officer
			<lb />
			after expiry of a period of four years from the end of relevant assessment

			year unless the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or
			<lb />
			Principal Commissioner or Commissioner is satisfied on the reasons
			<lb />
			recorded by the Assessing Officer that it was a fit case for issuance of such
			<lb />
			notice. As per sub-section (2) of Section 151 of the Act, in a case other than
			<lb />
			a case falling under sub-section (1), no notice could be issued by the
			<lb />
			Assessing Officer who is below the rank of Joint Commissioner unless the
			<lb />
			Joint Commissioner is satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Assessing
			<lb />
			Officer that it is a case fit for issuance of notice. Section 153 of the Act
			<lb />
			contained provisions for time limit for completion of assessments and
			<lb />
			reassessments. In nutshell, this was the scheme for reassessment that existed
			<lb />
			prior to the amendments made by the Finance Act, 2021.
			<lb />
			9
			<lb />
			The entire scheme of reassessment underwent major changes
			<lb />
			under the Finance Act, 2021 and the amendments have been brought into
			<lb />
			with effect from 1 st April 2021. Section 147 of the Act, as it stands now,
			<lb />
			provides that if any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for
			<lb />
			any assessment year, the Assessing Officer may, subject to the provisions of
			<lb />
			Sections 148 to 153 of the Act, assess or reassess such income or recompute
			<lb />
			the loss or the depreciation allowance or any other allowance or deduction
			<lb />
			for such assessment year. The distinction between the cases where income
			<lb />
			chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for the failure of the assessee to
			<lb />
			disclose truly or fully all material facts and the rest is a thing of the past.

			Section 151 of the Act pertaining to sanction for issue of notice

			has also been amended. As per the amended provisions, the specified

			<lb />
			(i) Principal Commissioner or Principal Director or Commissioner or

			issuing notice under Section 148 of the Act applicable would be ten years
			<lb />
			from the end of relevant assessment year.
			<lb />
			The Assessing Officer has reason to believe, as previously
			<lb />
			referred to Section 147 of the Act, has been done away with and the proviso
			<lb />
			to Section 148 of the Act, as it stands now, provides no notice for the
			<lb />
			reassessment would be issued unless there is information with the Assessing
			<lb />
			Officer which suggests that income chargeable to tax has escaped
			<lb />
			assessment.
			<lb />
			18
			<lb />
			The major change under the new regime of reassessment
			<lb />
			is introduction of Section 148A of the Act. This section in a way codifies the
			<lb />
			procedure prescribed in the well known case of the Supreme Court in GKN
			<lb />
			Driveshafts (India) Ltd. V/s. Income Tax Officer 8 . Clause -(a) of Section
			<lb />
			148A of the Act permits the Assessing Officer to conduct enquiry, if required,
			<lb />
			with the prior approval of the specified authority with respect to the
			<lb />
			information which suggests that income chargeable to tax has escaped
			<lb />
			assessment. Clause -(b) of Section 148A of the Act requires the Assessing
			<lb />
			Officer to provide an opportunity of being heard to the assessee by issuing
			<lb />
			notice calling upon him why notice under Section 148 of the Act should not
			<lb />
			be issued on the basis of information which suggests that income chargeable
			<lb />
			to tax has escaped assessment. Clause -(c) requires the Assessing Officer to
			<lb />
			consider the reply of the assessee, if furnished. As per clause -(d), the

			Assessing Officer would decide on the basis of material available on record
			<lb />
			and if reply is furnished, whether it is a fit case for issuing notice under
			<lb />
			Section 148 of the Act.
			<lb />
			Thus, the assessee even has an opportunity to oppose even
			<lb />
			issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act and he could legitimately
			<lb />
			expect the Assessing Officer to provide him the information which according
			<lb />
			to him suggests that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment.

			19
			<lb />
			Much before the Finance Act, 2021 was perhaps even
			<lb />
			conceived, sometime in March 2020 the country was hit by the COVID-19
			<lb />
			pandemic that led to nationwide strict lockdowns putting the lives of
			<lb />
			citizens and the Government machinery totally out of gear. It became
			<lb />
			almost impossible for individuals as well as Government authorities to
			<lb />
			adhere to several statutory time limits which in many cases were not
			<lb />
			extendable. To overcome these difficulties, particularly in the context of tax
			<lb />
			collections, the Government of India introduced the Relaxation Act as an
			<lb />
			ordinance and then later it was replaced by the Act. As an ordinance, it was
			<lb />
			only relaxation of certain provisions but when it became an Act, it became
			<lb />
			relaxation and amendment of certain provisions. The Act provided for
			<lb />
			specified Acts which were defined under Section 2 and it included the Act,
			<lb />
			i.e., Income Tax Act, 1961. Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Relaxation
			<lb />
			Ordinance, 2020 provided that any time limit in the specified Acts, which
			<lb />

			Under Notification No.20 of 2021, the time limit was extended
			<lb />
			to 30 th April 2021. Under Notification No.38 of 2021, the time limit for

			<lb />
			23
			<lb />
			In background of these facts and statutory provisions, the
			<lb />
			contentions raised in the petitions are :
			<lb />
			(a) upon enactment of the Finance Act, 2021, the provisions
			<lb />
			contained in the Act pertaining to reassessment of income stood substituted
			<lb />
			by new set of provisions and upon such substitution the old provisions
			<lb />
			ceased to exist. There is no indication, either in express terms or implied, in
			<lb />
			the newly introduced provisions that the legislature desired to retain the old
			<lb />
			provisions for the past period. In such circumstances, any action of issuance
			<lb />
			of notice for reassessment, which is taken after 1 st April 2021, must be in
			<lb />
			accordance with the amended provisions;
			<lb />
			(b) insertion of new provisions and substitution of the old
			<lb />
			would have the effect of repealing the old provisions which would cease to
			<lb />
			have any applicability thereafter;
			<lb />
			(c) the Relaxation Act merely authorised the Government to
			<lb />
			extend the time limits contained in the specified Act and that did not
			<lb />
			include power to issue any explanation or clarification. The subordinate
			<lb />
			legislature must submit to the limits of powers vested in it by the parent Act.
			<lb />
			By way of explanation, the subordinate legislature cannot revive the
			<lb />
			statutory provisions which had lapsed. The explanations contained in the

			notifications dated 31 st March 2021 and 27 th April 2021 are thus ultra vires
			<lb />
			the powers of the subordinate legislation and therefore, unconstitutional;
			<lb />
			(d) under the taxing statutes there is no scope for intendment.
			<lb />
			If two views are possible, one favouring the assessee should be taken.
			<lb />
			It was pointed out that the Division Bench of Allahabad High
			<lb />
			Court, Rajasthan High Court, Delhi High Court, Madras High Court and a
			<lb />
			single Judge of Calcutta High Court have already decided these issues in
			<lb />
			favour of the assessees. Being pan-India legislation in the field of taxation,
			<lb />
			the Court should strive to achieve consistency. The view adopted by these
			<lb />
			Courts, should, therefore, be followed by this Court.
			<lb />
			24
			<lb />
			On the other hand, the Revenue has opposed the petitions and
			<lb />
			contended that :
			<lb />
			(a) the substitution of old provisions for reopening of
			<lb />
			assessment would not obliterate the previous set of statutory provisions.
			<lb />
			They would continue to have effect for the past period, i.e., for assessment
			<lb />
			years upto 31 st March 2021. If the notice for reopening of assessment was
			<lb />
			issued for any period prior to 1 st April 2021, the provisions as they stood at
			<lb />
			the relevant time would apply. In such a case, there was no requirement of
			<lb />
			following the procedure laid down under Section 148A of the Act before
			<lb />
			issuing notice under Section 148 of the Act;
			<lb />
			(b) present situation is unprecedented and has arisen on
			<lb />
			account of pandemic caused by COVID-19. Unprecedented situation

			required extraordinary measures. The Relaxation Ordinance, 2020 and
			<lb />
			Relaxation Act were, therefore, framed giving extension of time limits for
			<lb />
			taking actions and making compliances. These extensions were for the
			<lb />
			benefit of both, actions that had to be taken by the Revenue as well as
			<lb />
			compliances which had to be made by the assessees. The assessees cannot
			<lb />
			take advantage of the unusual circumstances prevailing on account of
			<lb />
			COVID-19. The CBDT, therefore, in exercise of powers conferred in sub-
			<lb />
			section (1) of Section 3 of the Relaxation Act, has issued necessary
			<lb />
			explanation which merely clarifies which statutory provisions any way
			<lb />
			provide. This explanation makes explicit what is otherwise implicit under
			<lb />
			the Act. The same is well within the power of the Government.
			<lb />
			25
			<lb />
			Two questions, therefore, which come up for our consideration
			<lb />
			are :
			<lb />
			(a) Whether, after introduction of new provisions for
			<lb />
			reassessment of income by virtue of the Finance Act, 2021 with effect from
			<lb />
			1 st April 2021, substituting the then existing provisions, would the
			<lb />
			substituted provisions survive and could be used for issuing notices for
			<lb />
			reassessment for the past period?;
			<lb />
			(b) Whether the explanations contained in the CBDT Circular
			<lb />
			Nos.20 of 2021 of 31 st March 2021 and 38 of 2021 of 27 th April 2021 are
			<lb />
			legal and valid?

			<lb />
			A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the case of
			<lb />
			Ashok Kumar Agarwal (Supra) has ruled in favour of the assessee and in
			<lb />
			paragraphs 64 to 73 held as under :
			<lb />
			&quot;64. As to the first line of reasoning applied by the learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the petitioner, as noted above, there can be no
			<lb />
			exception to the principle -an Act of legislative substitution
			<lb />
			is a composite act. Thereby, the legislature chooses to put in
			<lb />
			place another or, replace an existing provision of law. It
			<lb />
			involves simultaneous omission and re-enactment. By its very
			<lb />
			nature, once a new provision has been put in place of a pre-
			<lb />
			existing provision, the earlier provision cannot survive,
			<lb />
			except for things done or already undertaken to be done or
			<lb />
			things expressly saved to be done. In absence of any express
			<lb />
			saving clause and, since no reassessment proceeding had
			<lb />
			been initiated prior to the Act of legislative substitution, the
			<lb />
			second aspect of the matter does not require any further
			<lb />
			examination.
			<lb />
			65. Therefore, other things apart, undeniably, on 01.04.2021,
			<lb />
			by virtue of plain/unexcepted effect of Section 1(2)(a) of the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2021, the provisions of Sections 147, 148, 149,
			<lb />
			151 (as those provisions existed upto 31.03.2021), stood
			<lb />
			substituted, along with a new provision enacted by way of
			<lb />
			Section 148A of that Act. In absence of any saving clause, to
			<lb />
			save the pre-existing (and now substituted) provisions, the
			<lb />
			revenue authorities could only initiate reassessment
			<lb />
			proceeding on or after 01.04.2021, in accordance with the
			<lb />
			substituted law and not the pre-existing laws.
			<lb />
			66. It is equally true that the Enabling Act that was
			<lb />
			pre-existing, had been enforced prior to enforcement of the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2021. It confronted the Act as amended by
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2021, as it came into existence on 01.04.2021.
			<lb />
			In the Enabling Act and the Finance Act, 2021, there is
			<lb />
			absence, both of any express provision in itself or to delegate
			<lb />
			the function -to save applicability of the provisions of
			<lb />
			sections 147, 148, 149 or 151 of the Act, as they existed up
			<lb />
			to 31.03.2021. Plainly, the Enabling Act is an enactment to
			<lb />
			extend timelines only. Consequently, it flows from the above -
			<lb />
			01.04.2021 onwards, all references to issuance of notice
			<lb />
			contained in the Enabling Act must be read as reference to
			<lb />
			the substituted provisions only. Equally there is no difficulty
			<lb />
			in applying the pre-existing provisions to pending
			<lb />
			proceedings. Looked in that manner, the laws are
			<lb />

			67. It may also be not forgotten, a reassessment proceeding is
			<lb />
			not just another proceeding emanating from a simple show
			<lb />
			cause notice. Both, under the pre-existing law as also under
			<lb />
			the law enforced from 01.04.2021, that proceeding must
			<lb />
			arise only upon jurisdiction being validly assumed by the
			<lb />
			assessing authority. Till such time jurisdiction is validly
			<lb />
			assumed by assessing authority -evidenced by issuance of
			<lb />
			the jurisdictional notice under Section 148, no
			<lb />
			re-assessment proceeding may ever be said to be pending
			<lb />
			before the assessing authority. The admission of the revenue
			<lb />
			authorities that all re-assessment notices involved in this
			<lb />
			batch of writ petitions had been issued after the enforcement
			<lb />
			date 01.04.2021, is tell-tale and critical. As a fact, no
			<lb />
			jurisdiction had been assumed by the assessing authority
			<lb />
			against any of the petitioners, under the unamended law.
			<lb />
			Hence, no time extension could ever be made under section
			<lb />
			3(1) of the Enabling Act, read with the Notifications issued
			<lb />
			thereunder.
			<lb />
			68. The submission of the learned Additional Solicitor
			<lb />
			General of India that the provision of Section 3(1) of
			<lb />
			the Enabling Act gave an overriding effect to that Act and
			<lb />
			therefore saved the provisions as existed under the
			<lb />
			unamended law, also cannot be accepted. That saving could
			<lb />
			arise only if jurisdiction had been validly assumed before the
			<lb />
			date 01.04.2021. In the first place Section 3(1) of the
			<lb />
			Enabling Act does not speak of saving any provision of law. It
			<lb />
			only speaks of saving or protecting certain proceedings from
			<lb />
			being hit by the rule of limitation. That provision also does
			<lb />
			not speak of saving any proceeding from any law that may be
			<lb />
			enacted by the Parliament, in future. For both reasons, the
			<lb />
			submission advanced by learned Additional Solicitor General
			<lb />
			of India is unacceptable.
			<lb />
			69. Even otherwise the word &apos;notwithstanding&apos; creating the
			<lb />
			non obstante clause, does not govern the entire scope of
			<lb />
			Section 3(1) of the Enabling Act. It is confined to and may be
			<lb />
			employed only with reference to the second part of Section
			<lb />
			3(1) of the Enabling Act i.e. to protect proceedings already
			<lb />
			under way. There is nothing in the language of that provision
			<lb />
			to admit a wider or sweeping application to be given to that
			<lb />
			clause -to serve a purpose not contemplated under that
			<lb />
			provision and the enactment, wherein it appears.
			<lb />
			70. The upshot of the above reasoning is, the Enabling Act
			<lb />
			only protected certain proceedings that may have become
			<lb />
			time barred on 20.03.2021, upto the date 30.06.2021.
			<lb />
			Correspondingly, by delegated legislation incorporated by the
			<lb />
			Central Government, it may extend that time limit. That time
			<lb />
			limit alone stood extended upto 30 June, 2021. We also note,
			<lb />
			the learned Additional Solicitor General of India may not be
			<lb />
			entirely correct in stating that no extension of time was

			granted beyond 30.06.2021. Vide Notification No. 3814
			<lb />
			dated 17.09.2021, issued under section 3(1) of the Enabling
			<lb />
			Act, further extension of time has been granted till
			<lb />
			31.03.2022. In absence of any specific delegation made, to
			<lb />
			allow the delegate of the Parliament, to indefinitely extend
			<lb />
			such limitation, would be to allow the validity of an enacted
			<lb />
			law i.e. the Finance Act, 2021 to be defeated by a purely
			<lb />
			colourable exercise of power, by the delegate of the
			<lb />
			Parliament.
			<lb />
			71. Here, it may also be clarified, Section 3(1) of the
			<lb />
			Enabling Act does not itself speak of reassessment
			<lb />
			proceeding or of Section 147 or Section 148 of the Act as it
			<lb />
			existed prior to 01.04.2021. It only provides a general
			<lb />
			relaxation of limitation granted on account of general
			<lb />
			hardship existing upon the spread of pandemic COVID -19.
			<lb />
			After enforcement of the Finance Act, 2021, it applies to the
			<lb />
			substituted provisions and not the pre-existing provisions.
			<lb />
			72. Reference to reassessment proceedings with respect to
			<lb />
			pre-existing and now substituted provisions of Sections 147
			<lb />
			and 148 of the Act has been introduced only by the later
			<lb />
			Notifications issued under the Act. Therefore, the validity of
			<lb />
			those provisions is also required to be examined. We have
			<lb />
			concluded as above, that the provisions of Sections 147, 148,
			<lb />
			148A, 149, 150 and 151 substituted the old/pre-existing
			<lb />
			provisions of the Act w.e.f. 01.04.2021. We have further
			<lb />
			concluded, in absence of any proceeding of reassessment
			<lb />
			having been initiated prior to the date 01.04.2021, it is the
			<lb />
			amended law alone that would apply. We do not see how the
			<lb />
			delegate i.e. Central Government or the CBDT could have
			<lb />
			issued the Notifications, plainly to over reach the principal
			<lb />
			legislation. Unless harmonized as above, those Notifications
			<lb />
			would remain invalid.
			<lb />
			73. Unless specifically enabled under any law and unless that
			<lb />
			burden had been discharged by the respondents, we are
			<lb />
			unable to accept the further submission advanced by the
			<lb />
			learned Additional Solicitor General of India that practicality
			<lb />
			dictates that the reassessment proceedings be protected.
			<lb />
			Practicality, if any, may lead to legislation. Once the matter
			<lb />
			reaches Court, it is the legislation and its language, and the
			<lb />
			interpretation offered to that language as may primarily be
			<lb />
			decisive to govern the outcome of the proceeding. To read
			<lb />
			practicality into enacted law is dangerous. Also, it would
			<lb />
			involve legislation by the Court, an idea and exercise we
			<lb />
			carefully tread away from.&quot;

			A Division Bench of Delhi High Court in the case of Mon Mohan
			<lb />
			Kohli (Supra), in paragraphs 42 to 48, while deciding the issue in favour of
			<lb />
			the assessee, observed as under :
			<lb />
			&quot;42. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, this Court
			<lb />
			is of the view that by virtue of Section 1 (2)(a) of the Finance
			<lb />
			Act, 2021, the substituted Sections 147, 148, 149 and 151 of
			<lb />
			the Income Tax Act, 1961 pertaining to reopening of
			<lb />
			assessments came into force on 1st April, 2021. The
			<lb />
			significance of the expression &apos;shall&apos; in Section 1 (2)(a) of
			<lb />
			the Finance Act, 2021 cannot be lost sight of. This is in
			<lb />
			contrast to the language under Section 1(2)(b) which states
			<lb />
			that Sections 108 to 123 of the Finance Act, 2021 shall come
			<lb />
			into force on such date, as the Central Government may, by
			<lb />
			Notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. The
			<lb />
			Memorandum to the Finance Bill, 2021, too, clarifies that its
			<lb />
			Sections 2 to 88 which included the substituted Sections 147
			<lb />
			to 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 will take effect from
			<lb />
			1st April, 2021. There is also no power with the
			<lb />
			Executive/Respondents/Revenue to defer/postpone the
			<lb />
			implementation of Sections 2 to 88 of the Finance Act, 2021
			<lb />
			which includes the substituted Sections 147 to 151 of the
			<lb />
			Income Tax Act, 1961.
			<lb />
			43. It is settled law that the law prevailing on the date of
			<lb />
			issuance of the notice under Section 148 has to be applied.
			<lb />
			[See: Foramer Vs. CIT (2001) 247 ITR 436 (All.), affirmed by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in (2003) 264 ITR 566 (SC), Varkey
			<lb />
			Jacob Co. Vs. CIT and Anr. (2002) 257 ITR 231 (Ker), Smt.
			<lb />
			N. Illamathy vs. ITO (2020) 275 taxman 25/195 CTR 543
			<lb />
			(Mad)(HC), RK Upadhyay v Shanabhai, (1987) 166 ITR 163
			<lb />
			(SC); CIT v Rameshwar Prasad, (1991) 188 ITR 291 (All
			<lb />
			HC); Dr. Onkar Dutt Sharma v CIT, (1967) 65ITR 359 (All
			<lb />
			HC)].
			<lb />
			44. This Court is of the view that had the intention of the
			<lb />
			Legislature been to keep the erstwhile provisions alive, it
			<lb />
			would have introduced the new provisions with effect from
			<lb />
			1st July, 2021, which has not been done. Accordingly, the
			<lb />
			notices relating to any assessment year issued under Section
			<lb />
			148 on or after 1st April, 2021 have to comply with the
			<lb />
			provisions of Sections 147, 148, 148A, 149 and 151 of the
			<lb />
			Income Tax Act, 1961 as specifically substituted by the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2021 with effect from 1st April, 2021.
			<lb />
			45. Consequently, this Court is of the opinion that as the
			<lb />
			Legislature has permitted re-assessment to be made in this
			<lb />
			manner only, it can be done in this manner, or not at all.

			SECTION 3(1) OF RELAXATION ACT EMPOWERS THE
			<lb />
			GOVERNMENT/EXECUTIVE TO EXTEND ONLY THE TIME
			<lb />
			LINES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE GOVERNMENT/EXECUTIVE
			<lb />
			CAN NEITHER MAKE OR CHANGE LAW OF THE LAND NOR
			<lb />
			CAN IT IMPEDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW MADE BY
			<lb />
			THE PARLIAMENT.
			<lb />
			46. Upon perusal of Section 3(1) of Relaxation Act,
			<lb />
			2020, this Court is of the view that it extends only the time
			<lb />
			lines. Section 3(1) of the Relaxation Act, 2020 stipulates that
			<lb />
			where, any time limit has been stipulated in a specified Act
			<lb />
			which falls between the period 20th day of March, 2020 and
			<lb />
			31st day of December, 2020 for the completion or compliance
			<lb />
			of such action as issuance of any notice under the
			<lb />
			provisions of the specified Acts and where completion or
			<lb />
			compliance of such action has not been made within such
			<lb />
			time, then the time limit for completion or compliance of
			<lb />
			such action shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the
			<lb />
			specified Acts, stand extended. It is important to bear in mind
			<lb />
			that Section 3(1) of the Relaxation Act, 2020 does not
			<lb />
			empower the Central Government to postpone the
			<lb />
			applicability of any provision which has been enacted from a
			<lb />
			particular date. There is a difference between extension of
			<lb />
			time of an action which is getting time barred and
			<lb />
			applicability of a provision which has been enacted and
			<lb />
			notified by the Legislature. Relaxation Act, 2020 nowhere
			<lb />
			delegates power to the Central Government to postpone the
			<lb />
			date of applicability of a new law enacted by the Legislature.
			<lb />
			Relaxation Act, 2020 also does not put any embargo on the
			<lb />
			power of the Legislature to legislate.
			<lb />
			47. Also, the impugned Explanations in the Notifications
			<lb />
			dated 31st March, 2021 and 27th April, 2021 are beyond the
			<lb />
			power delegated to the Government, as the Relaxation Act
			<lb />
			does not give power to Government to extend the erstwhile
			<lb />
			Sections 147 to 151 beyond 31st March, 2021 and/or defer
			<lb />
			the operation of substituted provisions enacted by the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2021. Accordingly, the provisions of Section
			<lb />
			148A had to be complied with before issuing notices under
			<lb />
			Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the submission
			<lb />
			of the respondents-Revenue based on the judgment passed
			<lb />
			by Chhattisgarh High Court in Palak Khatuja Vs. UOI
			<lb />
			(supra) does not find favour with this Court. After all, it is
			<lb />
			settled law that Executive cannot make or change law of the
			<lb />
			land without specific Authority from Parliament to do so.
			<lb />
			48. Consequently, the Relaxation Act, 2020 and Notifications
			<lb />
			issued thereunder can only change the time-lines applicable
			<lb />
			to the issuance of a Section 148 notice, but they cannot
			<lb />
			change the statutory provisions applicable thereto which are
			<lb />
			required to be strictly complied with. Further, just as the

			Executive cannot legislate, it cannot impede the
			<lb />
			implementation of law made by the Legislature.&quot;
			<lb />

			<lb />
			The Rajasthan High Court in the case of Sudesh Taneja (Supra)
			<lb />
			in paragraphs 31 to 37, 39 and 40 has held as under :
			<lb />
			31. We may now attempt to answer these questions ourselves
			<lb />
			with the aid of statutory provisions and law laid down in
			<lb />
			various decisions cited before us we may summarise certain
			<lb />
			principles applicable in the field of taxation and which
			<lb />
			principles would be invoked in the course of the judgment :-
			<lb />
			(i) A taxing statute must be interpreted strictly. Equity has no
			<lb />
			place in taxation nor while interpreting taxing statute
			<lb />
			intendment would have any place.
			<lb />
			In case of State of W.B. Vs. Kesoram Industries Ltd. And Ors.,
			<lb />
			(2004) 10 SCC 201, referring to Article 265 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution which provides that no tax shall be levied or
			<lb />
			collected except by authority of law, it was observed that in
			<lb />
			interpreting a taxing statute, equitable considerations are
			<lb />
			entirely out of place. Taxing statutes cannot be interpreted by
			<lb />
			any presumption or assumption. A taxing statute has to be
			<lb />
			interpreted in light of what is clearly expressed; it cannot
			<lb />
			imply anything which is not expressed; it cannot import
			<lb />
			provisions in the statute so as to supply any deficiency. Before
			<lb />
			taxing any person it must be shown that he falls within the
			<lb />
			ambit of charging section by clear words used in the section
			<lb />
			and if the words are ambiguous and open to two
			<lb />
			interpretations, the benefit of interpretation is given to the
			<lb />
			subject. There is nothing unjust in the tax payer escaping if
			<lb />
			the letter of the law fails to catch him on account of the
			<lb />
			legislature&apos;s failure to express itself clearly.
			<lb />
			\
			<lb />
			A Constitution Bench in the case of Commissioner of Customs
			<lb />
			(Import), Mumbai Vs. Dilip Kumar And Company And Ors.,
			<lb />
			(2018) 9 SCC 1, had reiterated these principles. It was a case
			<lb />
			where on a reference to the Larger Bench the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			was considering a question whether an ambiguity in a tax
			<lb />
			exemption provision or notification, the same must be
			<lb />
			interpreted so as to favour the assessee. Making a clear
			<lb />
			distinction between a charging provision of a taxing statute
			<lb />
			and exemption notification which waives a tax or a levy
			<lb />
			normally imposed, the Supreme Court observed as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;14. We may, here itself notice that the distinction in
			<lb />
			interpreting a taxing provision (charging provision)
			<lb />
			and in the matter of interpretation of exemption (98

			of 113) [CW-969/2022] notification is too obvious
			<lb />
			to require any elaboration. Nonetheless, in a
			<lb />
			nutshell, we may mention that, as observed in
			<lb />
			Surendra Cotton Oil Mills Case, in the matter of
			<lb />
			interpretation of charging Section of a taxation
			<lb />
			statute, strict Rule of interpretation is mandatory
			<lb />
			and if there are two views possible in the matter of
			<lb />
			interpretation of a charging section, the one
			<lb />
			favourable to the Assessee need to be applied. There
			<lb />
			is, however, confusion in the matter of interpretation
			<lb />
			of exemption notification published under taxation
			<lb />
			statutes and in this area also, the decisions are
			<lb />
			galore.
			<lb />
			24. In construing penal statutes and taxation
			<lb />
			statutes, the Court has to apply strict Rule of
			<lb />
			interpretation. The penal statute which tends to
			<lb />
			deprive a person of right to life and liberty has to be
			<lb />
			given strict interpretation or else many innocent
			<lb />
			might become victims of discretionary decision
			<lb />
			making. Insofar as taxation statutes are concerned,
			<lb />
			Article 265 of the Constitution prohibits the State
			<lb />
			from extracting tax from the citizens without
			<lb />
			authority of law. It is axiomatic that taxation statute
			<lb />
			has to be interpreted strictly because the State
			<lb />
			cannot at their whims and fancies burden the
			<lb />
			citizens without authority of law. In other words,
			<lb />
			when the competent Legislature mandates taxing
			<lb />
			certain
			<lb />
			persons/certain
			<lb />
			objects
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			certain
			<lb />
			circumstances, it cannot be expanded/interpreted to
			<lb />
			include those, which were not intended by the
			<lb />
			legislature.&quot;
			<lb />
			(ii) Being the central legislation of pan-India effect and
			<lb />
			operating in the field of taxation, the view of another High
			<lb />
			Court would have considerable persuasive value. In other
			<lb />
			words, the High Court would have due regard to the view
			<lb />
			already expressed by another High Court and to the possible
			<lb />
			extent prefer consistency of views across the country over
			<lb />
			discord. Unless the view expressed by another High Court is
			<lb />
			plainly unacceptable to the Court, the High Court would lean
			<lb />
			in favour of the well considered view already expressed by
			<lb />
			another Court.
			<lb />
			(iii) The speech made the Finance Minister on the floor of the
			<lb />
			House explaining the budgetary provisions would provide a
			<lb />
			useful tool in interpreting the taxing provisions particularly in
			<lb />
			case (99 of 113) [CW-969/2022] the dispute about their
			<lb />
			interpretation arises. When the Finance Minister who has
			<lb />
			piloted the budget in her speech explains the provisions
			<lb />
			contained in the Finance Bill and elaborates on the mischief

			which prevails and which is sought to be cured by substituting
			<lb />
			the existing statutory provisions, the explanation rendered by
			<lb />
			the Finance Minister has considerable importance in the
			<lb />
			context of correct interpretation of such provisions.
			<lb />
			In case of Sole Trustee, Loka Shikshana Trust Vs.
			<lb />
			Commissioner of Income Tax, reported in (1975) 101 ITR 234
			<lb />
			it was observed as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;It is true that it is dangerous and may be misleading to
			<lb />
			gather the meaning of the words used in an enactment
			<lb />
			merely from what was said by any speaker in the
			<lb />
			course of a debate in Parliament on the subject. Such a
			<lb />
			speech cannot be used to defeat or detract from a
			<lb />
			meaning which clearly emerges from a consideration of
			<lb />
			the enacting words actually used. But, in the case
			<lb />
			before us, the real meaning and purpose of the words
			<lb />
			used cannot be understood at all satisfactorily without
			<lb />
			referring to the past history of legislation on the subject
			<lb />
			and the speech of the mover of the amendment who
			<lb />
			was, undoubtedly, in the best position to explain what
			<lb />
			defect in the law the amendment had sought to
			<lb />
			remove. It was not just the speech of any member in
			<lb />
			Parliament. It was the considered statement of the
			<lb />
			Finance Minister who was proposing the amendment
			<lb />
			for a particular reason which he clearly indicated. If the
			<lb />
			reason given by him only elucidates what is also
			<lb />
			deducible from the words used in the amended
			<lb />
			provision, we do not see why we should refuse to take
			<lb />
			it into consideration as an aid to a correct
			<lb />
			interpretation. It harmonises with and clarifies the real
			<lb />
			intent of the words used. Must we, in such
			<lb />
			circumstances, ignore it?&quot;
			<lb />
			In case of K.P. Varghese Vs. Income Tax Officer, reported in
			<lb />
			(1981) 131 ITR 597 it was observed as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;Now it is true that the speeches made by the Members
			<lb />
			of the Legislature on the floor of the House when a Bill
			<lb />
			for enacting a statutory provision is being debated are
			<lb />
			inadmissible for the purpose of (100 of 113) [CW-
			<lb />
			969/2022] interpreting the statutory provision but the
			<lb />
			speech made by the Mover of the Bill explaining the
			<lb />
			reason for the introduction of the Bill can certainly be
			<lb />
			referred to for the purpose of ascertaining the mischief
			<lb />

			relevant should be admissible. In fact there are at least
			<lb />
			three decisions of this Court, one in Sole Trustee Loka
			<lb />
			Shikshana Trust v. CIT: [1975]101 ITR 234, the other in
			<lb />
			Indian Chamber of Commerce v. CIT: [1975]101 ITR
			<lb />
			796 and the third in Additional CIT v. Surat Art Silk
			<lb />
			Cloth Manufacturers Association [1980] 121 ITR
			<lb />
			1/[1980] 2 Taxman 501, where the speech made by the
			<lb />
			Finance Minister while introducing the exclusionary
			<lb />
			clause in Section 2 Clause (15) of the Act was relied
			<lb />
			upon by the Court for the purpose of ascertaining what
			<lb />
			was the reason for introducing that clause. The speech
			<lb />
			made by the Finance Minister while moving the
			<lb />
			amendment introducing Sub-section (2) clearly states
			<lb />
			what were the circumstances in which Sub-section (2)
			<lb />
			came to be passed, what was the mischief for which
			<lb />
			Section 52 as it then stood did not provide and which
			<lb />
			was sought to be remedied by the enactment of Sub-
			<lb />
			section (2) and why the enactment of Sub-section (2)
			<lb />
			was found necessary. It is apparent from the speech of
			<lb />
			the Finance Minister that Sub-section(2) was enacted
			<lb />
			for the purpose of reaching those cases where there was
			<lb />
			under-statement of consideration in respect of the
			<lb />
			transfer or to put it differently, the actual consideration
			<lb />
			received for the transfer was &apos;considerably more&apos; than
			<lb />
			that declared or shown by the assessee, but which were
			<lb />
			not covered by Sub-section (1) because the transferee
			<lb />
			was not directly or indirectly connected with the
			<lb />
			assessee. The object and purpose of Sub-section (2), as
			<lb />
			explicated from the speech of the Finance Minister, was
			<lb />
			not to strike at honest and bonafide transactions where
			<lb />
			the consideration for the transfer was correctly
			<lb />
			disclosed by the assessee but to bring within the net of
			<lb />
			taxation those transactions where the consideration in
			<lb />
			respect of the transfer was shown at a lesser figure than
			<lb />
			that actually received by the assessee, so that they do
			<lb />
			not escape the charge of tax on capital gains by under-
			<lb />
			statement of the consideration. This was real object and
			<lb />
			purpose of the enactment of Sub-section (2) and the
			<lb />
			interpretation of this sub-section must fall in line with
			<lb />
			the advancement of that object and purpose. We must
			<lb />
			therefore accept as the underlying assumption of Sub-
			<lb />
			section (2) that there is under-statement of
			<lb />
			consideration in respect of the transfer and
			<lb />
			Sub-
			<lb />
			section
			<lb />
			(2) applies only
			<lb />
			where
			<lb />
			the actual
			<lb />
			consideration received by the assessee is not disclosed
			<lb />
			and the consideration declared in respect of the transfer
			<lb />
			is shown at a lesser figure than that actually received.&quot;
			<lb />
			(iv) It is well accepted that reopening a completed assessment
			<lb />
			causes great hardship to the assessee and also brings
			<lb />
			uncertainty. In a judgment in case of Gujarat Power

			Corporation Ltd. Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax,
			<lb />
			reported in [2013] 350 ITR 266(Guj), a Division Bench of
			<lb />
			Gujarat High Court had observed as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;41. The powers under Section 147 of the Act are
			<lb />
			special powers and peculiar in nature where a quasi-
			<lb />
			judicial order previously passed after full hearing and
			<lb />
			which has otherwise become final is subject to
			<lb />
			reopening on certain grounds. Ordinarily, a judicial or
			<lb />
			quasi-judicial order is subject to appeal, revision or
			<lb />
			even review if statute so permits but not liable to be
			<lb />
			reopened by the same authority. Such powers are
			<lb />
			vested by the Legislature presumably in view of the
			<lb />
			highly complex nature of assessment proceedings
			<lb />
			involving a large number of assessees concerning
			<lb />
			multiple questions of claims, deductions and
			<lb />
			exemptions, which assessments have to be completed
			<lb />
			in a time frame. To protect the interests of the Revenue,
			<lb />
			therefore, such special provisions are made under
			<lb />
			section 147 of the Act. However, it must be appreciated
			<lb />
			that an assessment previously framed after scrutiny
			<lb />
			when reopened, results into considerable hardship to
			<lb />
			the assessee. The assessment gets reopened not only
			<lb />
			qua those grounds which are recorded in the reasons,
			<lb />
			but also with respect to the entire original assessment,
			<lb />
			of course at the hands of the Revenue. This obviously
			<lb />
			would lead to considerable hardship and uncertainty. It
			<lb />
			is precisely for this reason that even while recognizing
			<lb />
			such powers, in special requirements of the statute,
			<lb />
			certain safeguards are provided by the statute which
			<lb />
			are zealously guarded by the courts. Interpreting such
			<lb />
			statutory provisions courts upon courts have held that
			<lb />
			an assessment previously framed cannot be reopened
			<lb />
			on a mere change of opinion. It is stated that the power
			<lb />
			to reopening cannot be equated with review.&quot;
			<lb />
			32. The fact that under the Finance Act, 2021 the provisions
			<lb />
			for reassessment were substituted is beyond doubt. The notes
			<lb />
			on clauses for making relevant amendments clearly at every
			<lb />
			stage provide that the Bill proposes to substitute the existing
			<lb />
			provisions. For example it is stated that clause 35 seeks to
			<lb />
			amend Section 147 of the Act relating to income escaping
			<lb />
			assessment. Likewise under clause 36 Section 148 is proposed
			<lb />
			to be substituted so as to provide that before making the
			<lb />
			assessment, reassessment or recomputation under Section
			<lb />
			147 and subject to the provisions of Section 148A the
			<lb />
			Assessing Officer shall serve on the assessee a notice along
			<lb />
			with a copy of order passed under clause (d) of Section 148.
			<lb />
			The Finance Act itself also refers to the substitution of
			<lb />
			Sections 147, 148 and 149 etc. along side insertion of Section
			<lb />
			148A which as noted was being introduced for the first time.

			In the budged speech that the Finance Minister gave on the
			<lb />
			floor of the House it was explained that there was a proposal
			<lb />
			to reduce the time limit for reopening of the assessments. In
			<lb />
			the memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance
			<lb />
			Bill, 2021, it was provided that the Bill proposes a completely
			<lb />
			new procedure for assessment of cases of reopening. It was
			<lb />
			pointed out that new Section 148A proposes issuance of
			<lb />
			notice and passing of the order by the Assessing Officer. It was
			<lb />
			further provided as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;Another restriction has been provided that the notice
			<lb />
			under section 148 of the Act cannot be issued at any
			<lb />
			time in a case for the relevant assessment year
			<lb />
			beginning on or before 1st day of April, 2021, if such
			<lb />
			notice could not have been issued at that time on
			<lb />
			account of being beyond the time limit prescribed under
			<lb />
			the provisions of clause (b), as they stood immediately
			<lb />
			before the proposed amendment.
			<lb />
			Since the assessment or reassessment or re-
			<lb />
			computation in search or requisition cases (where such
			<lb />
			(103 of 113) [CW-969/2022] search or requisition is
			<lb />
			initiated or made on or before 31st March 2021) are to
			<lb />
			be carried out as per the provision of section 153A,
			<lb />
			153B, 153C and 153D of the Act, the aforesaid time
			<lb />
			limitation shall not apply to such cases.&quot;
			<lb />
			33. In case of Government of India and Others Vs. Indian
			<lb />
			Tobacco Association, reported in (2005) 7 SCC 396, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court considered the effect of substitution of a
			<lb />
			statutory provision by new one. It was observed as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;15. The word &quot;substitute&quot; ordinarily would mean &quot;to
			<lb />
			put (one) in place of another&quot;; or &quot;to replace&quot;. In Black&apos;s
			<lb />
			Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, at page 1281, the word
			<lb />
			&quot;substitute&quot; has been defined to mean &quot;to put in the
			<lb />
			place of another person or thing&quot;. or &quot;to exchange&quot;. In
			<lb />
			Collins English Dictionary, the word &quot;substitute&quot; has
			<lb />
			been defined to mean &quot;to serve or cause to serve in
			<lb />
			place of another person or thing&quot;; &quot;to replace (an atom
			<lb />
			or group in a molecule) with (another atom or group)&quot;;
			<lb />
			or &quot;a person or thing that serves in place of another,
			<lb />
			such as a player in a game who takes the place of an
			<lb />
			injured colleague&quot;.

			Act, 1973 by Act No. 15 of 1994 whereby the word
			<lb />
			&quot;after&quot; was substituted by the word &quot;upto&quot; fell for

			retrospective effect being declaratory in nature as
			<lb />
			thereby obvious absurdity occurring in the first
			<lb />
			amendment and bring the same in conformity with
			<lb />
			what the legislature really intended to provide was
			<lb />
			removed, stating: (SCC p. 12 paras 23-25)
			<lb />
			&quot;23. The text of Section 2 of the Second
			<lb />
			Amendment Act provides for the word &quot;&quot;upto&quot;&quot;
			<lb />
			being substituted for the word &quot;after&quot;. What is the
			<lb />
			meaning and effect of the expression employed
			<lb />
			therein -&quot;shall be substituted&quot;?
			<lb />
			24. The substitution of one text for the other pre-
			<lb />
			existing text is one of the known and well-
			<lb />
			recognised practices employed in legislative
			<lb />
			drafting. &apos;Substitution&apos; has to be distinguished
			<lb />
			from &apos;supersession&apos; or a mere repeal of an existing
			<lb />
			provision.
			<lb />
			25. Substitution of a provision results in repeal of
			<lb />
			the earlier provision and its (104 of 113) [CW-
			<lb />
			969/2022] replacement by the new provision
			<lb />
			(See Principles of Statutory Interpretation, ibid,
			<lb />
			p.565). If any authority is needed in support of
			<lb />
			the proposition, it is to be found in West U.P.
			<lb />
			Sugar Mills Assn. v. State of U.P., State of
			<lb />
			Rajasthan v. Mangilal Pindwal, Koteswar Vittal
			<lb />
			Kamath v. K. Rangappa Baliga and Co. and
			<lb />
			A.L.V.R.S.T. Veerappa Chettiar v. S. Michael. In
			<lb />
			West U.P. Sugar Mills Association case a three-
			<lb />
			Judges Bench of this Court held that the State
			<lb />
			Government by substituting the new rule in place
			<lb />
			of the old one never intended to keep alive the old
			<lb />
			rule. Having regard to the totality of the
			<lb />
			circumstances centering around the issue the
			<lb />
			Court held that the substitution had the effect of
			<lb />
			just deleting the old rule and making the new rule
			<lb />
			operative. In Mangilal Pindwal case this Court
			<lb />
			upheld the legislative practice of an amendment
			<lb />
			by substitution being incorporated in the text of a
			<lb />
			statute which had ceased to exist and held that
			<lb />
			the substitution would have the effect of
			<lb />
			amending the operation of law during the period
			<lb />
			in which it was in force. In Koteswar case a three-
			<lb />
			Judge Bench of this Court emphasized the
			<lb />
			distinction between &apos;supersession&apos; of a rule arid
			<lb />
			&apos;substitution&apos; of a rule and held that the process of
			<lb />
			substitution consists of two steps : first, the old
			<lb />
			rule is made to cease to exist and, next, the new
			<lb />
			rule is brought into existence in its place.&quot;

			34. In case of State of M.P. Vs. Kedia Leather &amp; Liquor Ltd.
			<lb />
			and Others, reported in (2003) 7 SCC 389, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;13. There is presumption against a repeal by
			<lb />
			implication; and the reason of this rule is based on the
			<lb />
			theory that the Legislature while enacting a law has a
			<lb />
			complete knowledge of the existing laws on the same
			<lb />
			subject matter, and therefore, when it does not provide
			<lb />
			a repealing provisions, the intention is clear not to
			<lb />
			repeal the existing legislation. (See: Municipal Council,
			<lb />
			Palai v. T.J. Joseph, Northern India Caterers (Private)
			<lb />
			Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Punjab and Anr., Municipal
			<lb />
			Corporation of Delhi v. Shiv Shanker and Ratan Lal
			<lb />
			Adukia and Anr. v. Union of India.) When the new Act
			<lb />
			contains a repealing section mentioning the Acts which
			<lb />
			it expressly repeals, the presumption (105 of 113) [CW-
			<lb />
			969/2022] against implied repeal of other laws is
			<lb />
			further strengthened on the principle expressio unius
			<lb />
			(persone vel rei) est exclusio alterius. (The express
			<lb />
			intention of one person or thing is the exclusion of
			<lb />
			another), as illuminatingly stated in Garnett v. Bradley.
			<lb />
			The continuance of existing legislation, in the absence
			<lb />
			of an express provision of repeal by implication lies on
			<lb />
			the party asserting the same. The presumption is,
			<lb />
			however, rebutted and a repeal is inferred by necessary
			<lb />
			implication when the provisions of the later Act are so
			<lb />
			inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of the
			<lb />
			earlier Act and that the two cannot stand together. But,
			<lb />
			if the two can be read together and some application
			<lb />
			can be made of the words in the earlier Act, a repeal
			<lb />
			will not be inferred. (See: A.G. v. Moore, Ratan Lal case
			<lb />
			and R.S. Raghunath v. State of Karnataka)&quot;
			<lb />
			35. In case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Mangilal Pindwal,
			<lb />
			reported in (1996) 5 SCC 60, it was observed that
			<lb />
			substitution of a provision results in repeal of the old
			<lb />
			provision and replacement by new provision. By repeal the
			<lb />
			provisions repealed ceased to exist with effect from the date
			<lb />
			of repeal but operation of the provision as it stood prior to
			<lb />
			repeal is not affected. It was held as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;9. As pointed out by this Court, the process of a
			<lb />
			substitution of statutory provision consists of two Steps
			<lb />
			first; the old rule is made to cease to exist and, next, the
			<lb />
			new rule is brought into existence in its place. [see
			<lb />
			Koteshwar Vittal Kamath v, K. Rangappa &amp; Co., SCR at
			<lb />
			p. 48] In other words, the substitution of a provision
			<lb />
			results in repeal of the earlier provision and its
			<lb />
			replacement by the new provision. As regards repeal
			<lb />
			of a statute the law is thus stated in Sutherland on

			Statutory Construction :
			<lb />
			&quot;The effect of the repeal of a statute where neither a
			<lb />
			saving clause nor a general saving statute exists to
			<lb />
			prescribed the governing rule for the effect of the
			<lb />
			repeal, is to destroy the effectiveness of the repealed act
			<lb />
			in futuro and to divest the right to proceed under the
			<lb />
			statute, which, except as to proceedings past and closed,
			<lb />
			is considered as if it had never existed.&quot; [Vol. I, para
			<lb />
			2042, pp.522-523]
			<lb />
			10. Similarly in Crawford&apos;s Interpretation of Laws it has
			<lb />
			been said : &quot;Effect of Repeal, Generally. -In the (106 of
			<lb />
			113) [CW-969/2022] first place, an outright repeal will
			<lb />
			destroy the effectiveness of the repealed act in futuro
			<lb />
			and operate to destroy inchoate rights dependent on it,
			<lb />
			as a general rule. In many cases, however, where
			<lb />
			statutes are repealed, they continue to be the law of the
			<lb />
			period during which they were in force with reference
			<lb />
			to numerous matters.&quot; [pp.640-641]
			<lb />
			11. The observations of Lord Tenterden and Tindal, C.J.
			<lb />
			referred in the abovementioned passages in Craies on
			<lb />
			Statute Law also indicate that the principle that on
			<lb />
			repeal a statute is obliterated is subject to the exception
			<lb />
			that it exists in respect of transactions past and closed.
			<lb />
			To the same effect is the Jaw laid down by this Court.
			<lb />
			[See :Qudrat Ullah v. Municipal Board. Bareilly, SCR at
			<lb />
			p. 539]
			<lb />
			12. This means that as a result of repeal of a statute the
			<lb />
			statute as repealed ceases to exist with effect from the
			<lb />
			date of such repeal but the repeal does not affect the
			<lb />
			previous operation of the law which has been repealed
			<lb />
			during the period it was operative prior to the date of
			<lb />
			such repeal..........&quot;
			<lb />
			36. It can thus be seen that original provisions upon their
			<lb />
			substitution stood repealed for all purposes and had no
			<lb />
			existence after introduction of the substituting provisions. We
			<lb />
			may refer to Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which
			<lb />
			provides inter-alia that where the State Act or Central Act or
			<lb />
			regulation repeals any enactment then unless a different
			<lb />
			intention appears repeal shall not revive anything not in force
			<lb />
			or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect or
			<lb />
			affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or
			<lb />
			anything duly done or suffered thereunder. Under the
			<lb />
			circumstances after substitution unless there is any intention
			<lb />
			discernible in the scheme of statute either pre-existing or
			<lb />
			newly introduced, the substituted provisions would not
			<lb />
			survive.

			37. In this context we have perused the provisions of
			<lb />
			reassessment contained in the Finance Act, 2021. We have
			<lb />
			noticed earlier the major departure that the new scheme of
			<lb />
			reassessment (107 of 113) [CW-969/2022] has made under
			<lb />
			these provisions. The time limits for issuing notice for
			<lb />
			reassessment have been changed. The concept of income
			<lb />
			chargeable to tax escaping assessment on account of failure
			<lb />
			on the part of the assessee to disclose truly or fully all
			<lb />
			material facts is no longer relevant. Elaborate provisions are
			<lb />
			made under Section 148A of the Act enabling the Assessing
			<lb />
			Officer to make enquiry with respect to material suggesting
			<lb />
			that income has escaped assessment, issuance of notice to the
			<lb />
			assessee calling upon why notice under Section 148 should
			<lb />
			not be issued and passing an order considering the material
			<lb />
			available on record including response of the assessee if made
			<lb />
			while deciding whether the case is fit for issuing notice under
			<lb />
			Section 148. There is absolutely no indication in all these
			<lb />
			provisions which would suggest that the legislature intended
			<lb />
			that the new scheme of reopening of assessments would be
			<lb />
			applicable only to the period post 01.04.2021. In absence of
			<lb />
			any such indication all notices which were issued after
			<lb />
			01.04.2021 had to be in accordance with such provisions. To
			<lb />
			reiterate, we find no indication whatsoever in the scheme of
			<lb />
			statutory provisions suggesting that the past provisions would
			<lb />
			continue to apply even after the substitution for the
			<lb />
			assessment periods prior to substitution. In fact there are
			<lb />
			strong indications to the contrary. We may recall, that time
			<lb />
			limits for issuing notice under Section 148 of the Act have
			<lb />
			been modified under substituted Section 149. Clause (a) of
			<lb />
			sub-section (1) of Section 149 reduces such period to three
			<lb />
			years instead of originally prevailing four years under normal
			<lb />
			circumstances. Clause (b) extends the upper limit of six years
			<lb />
			previously prevailing to ten years in cases where income
			<lb />
			chargeable to tax which has escaped assessment amounts to
			<lb />
			or is likely to amount (108 of 113) [CW-969/2022] to 50 lacs
			<lb />

			<lb />
			as expands the time limit for issuing notice under Section 148
			<lb />
			depending on the question whether the case falls under clause
			<lb />
			(a) or clause (b). In this context the first proviso to Section
			<lb />
			149(1) provides that no notice under Section 148 shall be
			<lb />
			issued at any time in a case for the relevant assessment year
			<lb />
			beginning on or before 01.04.2021 if such notice could not
			<lb />
			have been issued at that time on account of being beyond the
			<lb />
			time limit specified under the provisions of clause (b) of sub-
			<lb />
			section (1) of Section 149 as they stood immediately before
			<lb />
			the commencement of the Finance Act, 2021. As per this
			<lb />
			proviso thus no notice under Section 148 would be issued for
			<lb />
			the past assessment years by resorting to the larger period of
			<lb />
			limitation prescribed in newly substituted clause (b) of
			<lb />
			Section 149(1). This would indicate that the notice that

			substituted Section 149(1) but without breaching the upper
			<lb />
			time limit provided in the original Section 149(1) which stood
			<lb />
			substituted. This aspect has also been highlighted in the
			<lb />
			memorandum explaining the proposed provisions in the
			<lb />
			Finance Bill. If according to the revenue for past period
			<lb />
			provisions of section 149 before amendment were applicable,
			<lb />
			this first proviso to section 149(1) was wholly unnecessary.
			<lb />
			Looked from both angles, namely, no indication of surviving
			<lb />
			the past provisions after the substitution and in fact an active
			<lb />
			indication to the contrary, inescapable conclusion that we
			<lb />
			must arrive at is that for any action of issuance of notice
			<lb />
			under Section 148 after 01.04.2021 the newly introduced
			<lb />
			provisions under the Finance Act, 2021 would apply. Mere
			<lb />
			extension of time limits for issuing notice under section 148
			<lb />
			would not change this position that obtains in law. Under no
			<lb />
			circumstances the extended period available in clause (b) of
			<lb />
			sub-section (1) of Section 149 which we may recall now
			<lb />
			stands at 10 years instead of 6 years previously available with
			<lb />
			the revenue, can be pressed in service for reopening
			<lb />
			assessments for the past period. This flows from the plain
			<lb />
			meaning of the first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 149.
			<lb />
			In plain terms a notice which had become time barred prior to
			<lb />
			01.04.2021 as per the then prevailing provisions, would not
			<lb />
			be revived by virtue of the application of Section 149(1)(b)
			<lb />
			effective from 01.04.2021. All the notices issued in the
			<lb />
			present cases are after 01.04.2021 and have been issued
			<lb />
			without following the procedure contained in Section 148A of
			<lb />
			the Act and are therefore invalid.
			<lb />
			38. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
			<lb />
			39. It is well settled that there is presumption of
			<lb />
			constitutionality of a statute (refer to the Constitution Bench
			<lb />
			judgment in case of The State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Vs.
			<lb />
			Triloki Nath Khosa and Ors., reported in AIR 1974 SC 1). The
			<lb />
			said principle of presumption of constitutionality also applies
			<lb />
			to piece of delegated legislation. In case of St. Johns Teachers
			<lb />
			Training Institute Vs. Regional Director, National Council For
			<lb />
			Teachers Education and Another, reported in (2003) 3 SCC
			<lb />
			321, it was observed that it is well settled in considering the
			<lb />
			vires of subordinate legislation one should start with the
			<lb />
			presumption that it is intra vires and if it is open to two
			<lb />
			constructions, one of which would make it valid and other
			<lb />
			invalid, the courts must adopt that construction which makes
			<lb />
			it valid. However it is equally well (110 of 113) [CW-
			<lb />
			969/2022] settled that the subordinate legislation does not
			<lb />
			enjoy same level of immunity as the law framed by the
			<lb />
			Parliament or the State Legislature. The law framed by the
			<lb />
			Parliament or the State Legislature can be challenged only on
			<lb />
			the grounds of being beyond the legislative competence or
			<lb />
			being contrary to the fundamental rights or any other

			constitutional provisions. Third ground of challenge which is
			<lb />
			now recognized in the judgment in case of Shayara Bano Vs
			<lb />
			Union of India reported in 2017 9 SCC 1 is of legislation
			<lb />
			being manifestly arbitrary. A subordinate legislation can be
			<lb />
			challenged on all these grounds as well as on the grounds that
			<lb />
			it does not conform to the statute under which it is made or
			<lb />
			that it is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act or it is
			<lb />
			contrary to some of the statutes applicable on the subject
			<lb />
			matter. In case of J.K. Industries Ltd. and Ors. Vs. Union of
			<lb />
			India and Ors., reported in (2007) 13 SCC 673, it was
			<lb />
			observed as under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;63. At the outset, we may state that on account of
			<lb />
			globalization and socio-economic problems (including
			<lb />
			income disparities in our economy) the power of
			<lb />
			Delegation has become a constituent element of
			<lb />
			legislative power as a whole. However, as held in the
			<lb />
			case of Indian Express Newspaper v. Union of India
			<lb />
			reported in (1985) 1 SCC 641 at page 689, subordinate
			<lb />
			legislation does not carry the same degree of immunity
			<lb />
			which is enjoyed by a statute passed by a competent
			<lb />
			Legislature. Subordinate legislation may be questioned
			<lb />
			on any of the grounds on which plenary legislation is
			<lb />
			questioned. In addition, it may also be questioned on
			<lb />
			the ground that it does not conform to the statute under
			<lb />
			which it is made. It may further be questioned on the
			<lb />
			ground that it is inconsistent with the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Act or that it is contrary to some other statute applicable
			<lb />
			on the same subject matter. Therefore, it has to yield to
			<lb />
			plenary legislation. It can also be questioned on the
			<lb />
			ground that it is manifestly arbitrary and unjust. That,
			<lb />
			any inquiry into its vires must be confined to the
			<lb />
			grounds on which plenary legislation may be
			<lb />
			questioned, to the grounds that it is contrary to the
			<lb />
			statute under which it is made, to the grounds that it is
			<lb />
			contrary to other statutory provisions or on the ground
			<lb />
			that it is (111 of 113) [CW-969/2022] so patently
			<lb />
			arbitrary that it cannot be said to be inconformity with
			<lb />
			the statute. It can also be challenged on the ground that
			<lb />
			it violates Article 14 of the Constitution.&quot;
			<lb />
			40. With this background we may revert to the Relaxation
			<lb />
			Act, 2020 and the two notifications issued by the CBDT. We
			<lb />
			may recall, under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the
			<lb />
			Relaxation Act, 2020 while extending the time limits for
			<lb />
			taking action and making compliances in the specified Acts
			<lb />
			upto 31.12.2020 the power was given to the Central
			<lb />
			Government to extend the time further by issuing a
			<lb />
			notification. This was the only power vested in the Central
			<lb />
			Government. As a piece of delegated legislation the

			within the confines of such powers. In plain terms under sub-
			<lb />
			section (1) of Section 3 of the Relaxation Act, 2020 the
			<lb />
			Government of India was authorized to extend the time limits
			<lb />
			by issuing notifications in this regard. Issuing any explanation
			<lb />
			touching the provisions of the Income Tax Act was not part of
			<lb />
			this delegation at all. The CBDT while issuing the notifications
			<lb />
			dated 31.03.2021 and 27.04.2021 when introduced an
			<lb />
			explanation which provided by way of clarification that for
			<lb />
			the purposes of issuance of notice under Section 148 as per
			<lb />
			the time limits specified in Section 149 or 151, the provisions
			<lb />
			as they stood as on 31.03.2021 before commencement of the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2021 shall apply, plainly exceeded its jurisdiction
			<lb />
			as a subordinate legislation. The subordinate legislation could
			<lb />
			not have travelled beyond the powers vested in the
			<lb />
			Government of India by the parent Act. Even otherwise it is
			<lb />
			extremely doubtful whether the explanation in the guise of
			<lb />
			clarification can change the very basis of the statutory
			<lb />
			provisions. If the plain meaning of the statutory provision and
			<lb />
			its (112 of 113) [CW-969/2022] interpretation is clear, by
			<lb />
			adopting a position different in an explanation and describing
			<lb />
			it to be clarificatory, the subordinate legislature cannot be
			<lb />
			permitted to amend the provisions of the parent Act.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, these explanations are unconstitutional and
			<lb />
			declared as invalid.
			<lb />
			29
			<lb />
			At the outset, we had made it clear to Mr. Anil Singh, learned
			<lb />
			ASG that we were inclined to go along with the view expressed by the three
			<lb />
			Division Benches of Allahabad High Court, Rajasthan High Court and Delhi
			<lb />
			High Court. During the hearing our attention was invited to the judgment of
			<lb />
			the Division Bench of Madras High Court in Vellore Institute of Technology
			<lb />
			(Supra). We expressed that we were inclined to take a similar view as
			<lb />
			expressed by all the Division Benches and independently also we hold the
			<lb />
			same view. We also indicated to the learned ASG that we were unable to
			<lb />
			persuade ourselves to accept the analysis of the learned Single Judge of the
			<lb />
			Chhattisgarh High Court in Palak Khatuja (Supra).

			<lb />
			We asked Mr. Anil Singh, learned ASG if he has anything more
			<lb />
			to argue apart from the submissions of Revenue already recorded in these
			<lb />
			judgments of the four Division Benches. Mr. Anil Singh, learned ASG
			<lb />
			answered in affirmative.
			<lb />
			31
			<lb />
			Before we proceed further in detail with the submissions of the
			<lb />
			learned ASG, Mr. Mistri and Mr. Pardiwalla, we would note the compact
			<lb />
			submissions made by Mr. Chatterji and Mr. Andhyarujina :
			<lb />
			(a) Mr. Chatterji, inter alia, emphasized that once legislature
			<lb />
			has exercised its powers of legislation by enacting Finance Act, 2021, then
			<lb />
			any action like issuance of impugned notifications contrary to said
			<lb />
			legislation taken by any other agency/wing of the Government is bad in law
			<lb />
			as the same would fall foul of the doctrine of occupied filed as held by the
			<lb />
			Apex Court in A.B. Kirshna and Ors. V/s. State of Karnataka and Ors 10 .
			<lb />
			Mr. Chatterji submitted that no authority was vested in Government to issue
			<lb />
			the impugned notifications so as to disturb/intrude into the field occupied
			<lb />
			by the legislature.
			<lb />
			(b) Mr. Andhyarujina kept his submissions brief as others were
			<lb />
			already covering everything and submitted that essential legislative
			<lb />
			functions and extension of limitation period cannot be delegated and if
			<lb />
			limitation period is altered by a subordinate authority, then the delegation is
			<lb />
			excessive and the doctrine of ultra vires can be invoked which envisages that

			a subordinate authority can exercise only so much power as is conferred to
			<lb />
			it under the law. Mr. Andhyarujina also submitted that since the Finance Act,
			<lb />
			2021 is the latter Act in the instant case, the general rule of law states that
			<lb />
			when there is a conflict between two statues, the one that is more recent
			<lb />
			prevails and in this case, since the Finance Act was more recent compared to
			<lb />
			the Relaxation Act, the provisions of Finance Act would prevail over the
			<lb />
			provisions made in the Relaxation Act. Therefore, as the relaxation and
			<lb />
			extension of the period of limitation in respect of issuing reopening notices
			<lb />
			can only be a function or a power conferred only to the legislation and not a
			<lb />
			subordinate authority, the two notifications extending the period of
			<lb />
			limitation are ultra vires and bad in law and vitiated in law since the
			<lb />
			authority to extend the period of limitation did not vest with the authority at
			<lb />
			all.
			<lb />
			Both Mr. Chatterji and Mr. Andhyarujina supported the
			<lb />
			submissions of Mr. Mistri and Mr. Pardiwalla.

			<lb />
			Now reverting to the submissions of learned ASG, during the
			<lb />
			course of hearing, learned ASG tendered a synopsis of submissions spread in
			<lb />
			39 paragraphs. Learned ASG stated that paragraphs 1 to 15 contained
			<lb />
			additional arguments of respondents other than those urged before and
			<lb />
			negated by the various High Courts and paragraphs 16 to 39 deal with
			<lb />
			issues already considered and dealt with by various High Courts and he

			reiterated and adopted the stand taken by the Revenue before those Courts.
			<lb />
			Revenue&apos;s additional arguments, as set out in the synopsis, are
			<lb />
			as under :
			<lb />
			A. The Notifications do not result in creating an overlap in
			<lb />
			statutory schemes and there is no question of the Executive seeking to apply
			<lb />
			provisions of law after they have been substituted/repealed by Parliament.
			<lb />
			Relaxation Act applies only to actions to be taken between 20 th March 2020
			<lb />
			and 31 st March 2021, a date before the Finance Act, 2021 came into force.
			<lb />
			Thus, Relaxation Act and the Notifications would apply only in respect of
			<lb />
			matters where the time fell due for any act prior to Finance Act, 2021
			<lb />
			coming into force, i.e., prior to 31 st March 2021. However, Relaxation Act
			<lb />
			permits the action to be taken in such cases within certain extended
			<lb />
			timelines owing to the pandemic.
			<lb />
			B. The use of the word &quot;such action&quot; in Section 3(1) of the
			<lb />
			Relaxation Act reveals the legislative intent that it is the very same &quot;action&quot;
			<lb />
			which is permitted to be complied with within the extended deadline. As a
			<lb />
			sequitur, all legal conditions precedent, pre-requisites, limitations and
			<lb />
			procedural norms as applicable on the original date on which &quot;such action&quot;
			<lb />
			was required to be completed/complied/fell due under the Act, would apply,
			<lb />
			even though &quot;such action&quot; is being taken/complied within the extended time
			<lb />
			period provided for under the Relaxation Act and the Notifications
			<lb />
			thereunder. Accordingly, notices under Section 148 of the Act will &quot;relate

			back&quot; and be governed by the previous unamended law. This interpretation
			<lb />
			is apparent from the object of the Relaxation Act, i.e., &quot;In view of the spread
			<lb />
			of pandemic Covid-19 across many countries of the world including India,
			<lb />
			causing immense loss to the lives of people, it had become imperative to
			<lb />
			relax certain provisions, including extension of time-limit&quot; and the plain
			<lb />
			language of Section 3(1) of the Relaxation Act.
			<lb />
			C. It is to be inferred that Section 3(1) of the Relaxation Act
			<lb />
			requires that extended time limits for issue of, inter alia, Section 148 notices
			<lb />
			would also mean/require that the conditions for issue of Section 148 notices
			<lb />
			should be in terms of the Act as it stood on the date of the expiry of the said
			<lb />
			time limits, i.e., a &apos;stop-the-clock&apos; provision, wherein a fiction is created as if
			<lb />
			the compliance of the action is made within the time limit specified in the
			<lb />
			unamended Income-tax Act as it stood when the time for compliance
			<lb />
			expired between 20 th March 2020 and 31 st March 2021.
			<lb />
			D. All reopening notices challenged have been issued in
			<lb />
			accordance with/under the unamended provisions of the Income-tax Act,
			<lb />
			1961, as the provisions of the Relaxation Act empowered assessing officers
			<lb />
			to do so. The case of the Revenue is not that the old provisions apply after
			<lb />
			1 st April 2021, but Section 3(1) empowers the officer to issue notices under
			<lb />
			the old law.
			<lb />
			E. Relaxation Act is a beneficial legislation which relaxes
			<lb />
			requirements in specified Acts for both assessees and revenue alike which

			<lb />
			F. Referring to para 80 of the decision of the Hon&apos;ble Allahabad
			<lb />
			High Court -liberty should be granted to initiate reassessment proceedings
			<lb />
			in accordance with the provisions of the Act, as amended by Finance Act,
			<lb />
			2021, after making all compliances, as required by law.
			<lb />
			33
			<lb />
			The submissions made by learned ASG, as additional arguments
			<lb />
			of respondents, as submitted by Mr. Mistri, with whom we agree, in effect
			<lb />
			are all restatement, made in different style, of the same argument urged
			<lb />
			before the Allahabad, Delhi, Rajasthan, Calcutta and Madras High Court.
			<lb />
			They had already argued/ contended that as the original time limit for
			<lb />
			issuing a notice under Section 148 of the Act was expiring on or before
			<lb />
			31 st March 2021 and such time limit has been extended by the Relaxation
			<lb />
			Act, the old/unamended provisions of Section 148 of the Act will continue
			<lb />
			to govern such notices. This submission of respondents ignores the legal
			<lb />
			position that the provisions of Sections 147 to 151 of the Act have been
			<lb />
			substituted with effect from 1 st April 2021 by the Finance Act, 2021. Further
			<lb />
			a new Section 148A of the Act has been inserted with effect from 1 st April
			<lb />
			2021. Accordingly, the old/unamended provisions of Sections 148 to 151
			<lb />
			cease to have legal effect after 31 st March 2021 and the substituted
			<lb />
			provisions of Sections 148 to 151 have binding force from 1 st April 2021. In
			<lb />
			the absence of a savings clause there is no legal device by which a repealed
			<lb />
			set of provisions can be applied and a set of provisions on the statute book

			(in force) can be ignored. Further if the revenue&apos;s contention had the
			<lb />
			semblance of legality or validity, the impugned Explanations in Notification
			<lb />
			Nos. 20 and 38 of 2021 are otiose and superfluous. Moreover, Revenue&apos;s
			<lb />
			arguments are unsustainable as various High Courts have considered and
			<lb />
			rejected the said arguments or facets thereof.
			<lb />
			34
			<lb />
			It is well settled that the validity of a notice issued under
			<lb />
			Section 148 of the Act must be judged on the basis of the law existing on the
			<lb />
			date on which such notice is issued. Even the Revenue accepts this well
			<lb />
			settled position. Further, the provisions of Sections 147 to 151 are
			<lb />
			procedural laws and accordingly, the provisions as existing on the date of
			<lb />
			the notice would be applicable. Even the revenue accepts this legal position
			<lb />
			and the CBDT Circular No.549 of 1989, that Mr. Mistri relied upon,
			<lb />
			explaining the provisions of the Finance Act, 1989 specifically sets out that
			<lb />
			any notices issued by Revenue after the amendment made by the Finance
			<lb />
			Act, 1989 must comply with the amended provision of the law. Therefore,
			<lb />
			any notice issued after 1 st April, 2021 must comply with the amended
			<lb />
			provisions of the Act which was amended with effect from 1 st April, 2021.
			<lb />
			This contention has also been considered and upheld by the Delhi High
			<lb />
			Court and the Allahabad High Court.

			thing must be done in that specified manner alone, and any other
			<lb />
			method/(s) of performance cannot be upheld. Hence, notices issued under
			<lb />
			Section 148 of the Act after 1 st April, 2021 must comply with the amended
			<lb />
			provisions of law and cannot be sustained on the basis of the erstwhile
			<lb />
			provision.
			<lb />
			36
			<lb />
			In order to uphold the arguments of the Revenue in this regard,
			<lb />
			either a savings clause, or a specific legislative enactment deferring
			<lb />
			applicability of the amended provisions and the repeal of the old provisions
			<lb />
			of the Act, would be required. Plainly no such savings clause or enactment is

			<lb />

			<lb />
			Section 3(1) of Relaxation Act does not provide that any notice

			that the provision as existing on such date will be applicable to notices

			Relaxation Act, as Mr. Mistri rightly submitted, makes it clear that Section
			<lb />
			3(1) of Relaxation Act merely extends the limitation provided in the
			<lb />
			specified Acts (including Income-tax Act) for doing certain Acts but such
			<lb />
			Acts must be performed in accordance with the provisions of the specified

			Acts. Therefore, if there is an amendment in the specified Act, the amended

			provision of the specified Act would apply to such actions of the Revenue.

			The Delhi High Court has considered and rejected the contention of the
			<lb />
			Revenue that the notice issued after 1 st April 2021 relates back to an earlier
			<lb />
			period.
			<lb />
			38
			<lb />
			The Delhi High Court has considered and rejected this
			<lb />
			argument of the Revenue that Relaxation Act creates a legal fiction such that
			<lb />
			the notices issued under Section 148 of the Act are deemed to be issued on
			<lb />
			31 st March, 2021. The so-called legal fiction is directly contrary to the
			<lb />
			Revenue&apos;s own Circular No.549 of 1989, which is binding on them as well as
			<lb />
			the well settled principle that the validity of a notice is to be judged on the
			<lb />
			basis of the law that prevails at the time of its issue.
			<lb />
			39
			<lb />
			Even though Relaxation Act was in existence when the Finance
			<lb />
			Act, 2021 was passed, the parliament has specifically made the amended
			<lb />
			provisions of Sections 147 to 151 of the Act as being applicable with effect
			<lb />
			from 1 st April, 2021. Therefore, the intention of the legislature is clear that
			<lb />
			substituted provisions must apply to notices issued with effect from 1 st April,
			<lb />
			2021. No savings clause has been provided in the Act for saving the
			<lb />
			erstwhile provisions of Sections 147 to 151 of the Act, like in Section 297 of
			<lb />
			the Act where, the Parliament when it intended, has specifically provided
			<lb />
			the savings clause.
			<lb />
			40
			<lb />
			On a plain reading of Relaxation Act it is clear that the only
			<lb />
			powers granted to the Central Government by Relaxation Act is the power to

			notify the period during which actions are required to be taken that can fall
			<lb />
			within the ambit of Relaxation Act, and the power to extend the time limit
			<lb />
			within which those actions are to be taken. A plain reading of the impugned
			<lb />
			Explanations in Notification Nos.20 of 2021 and 38 of 2021 shows that it
			<lb />
			purports to &quot;clarify&quot; that the unamended provisions of Sections 147 to 151
			<lb />
			of the Act will apply for the purposes of issue of notices under Section 148
			<lb />
			of the Act, which is clearly ultra vires Relaxation Act.
			<lb />
			41
			<lb />
			In our view, the reopening notices issued after 1 st April, 2021
			<lb />
			are unsustainable and bad in law even if one was to apply the Explanations
			<lb />
			to the Notification Nos.20 of 2021 and 38 of 2021. The Explanation seeks to
			<lb />
			extend the applicability of erstwhile Sections 148, 149 and 151. The
			<lb />
			impugned Explanation does not cover Section 147, which (as amended)
			<lb />
			empowers the revenue to reopen an assessment subject to Sections 148 to
			<lb />
			153, which includes Section 148A. Thus, even if Explanations are valid, the
			<lb />
			mandatory procedure laid down by Section 148A has not been followed and
			<lb />
			hence, without anything further, the notices under Section 148 of the Act
			<lb />
			are invalid and must be struck down for this reason as well. This proposition
			<lb />
			has also been upheld by the Delhi High Court.
			<lb />
			42
			<lb />
			As regards Revenue&apos;s arguments that Relaxation Act being a
			<lb />
			beneficial legislation must be given purposive interpretation&apos;, the purpose of
			<lb />
			Section 3(1) of Relaxation Act is to extend limitation periods as provided in

			a specified Act (including the Income-tax Act). The purpose of Section 3(1)
			<lb />
			of Relaxation Act is not to postpone the applicability of amended provisions
			<lb />
			of a Specified Act. Though Relaxation Act was in existence when the Finance
			<lb />
			Act, 2021 was passed, the Parliament has specifically enacted the new,
			<lb />
			(amended) provisions of Section 147 to 151 of the Act and made them
			<lb />
			applicable with effect form 1 st April, 2021. Therefore, it is clear that
			<lb />
			amendment is to be applied from 1 st April, 2021. Further, when there is no
			<lb />
			ambiguity on the applicability of the provision, there is no question of
			<lb />
			resorting to purpose test.
			<lb />
			43
			<lb />
			As regards liberty granted by the Allahabad High Court,
			<lb />
			certainly, if the law permits issuance of notices under Section 148 of the Act
			<lb />
			(as amended), afresh, then no liberty is required to be granted by the Court,
			<lb />
			and it would be within the Assessing Officer&apos;s powers to initiate proceedings
			<lb />
			as per the amended law. The Madras High Court has considered this very
			<lb />
			plea and granted liberty to initiate reassessment proceedings in accordance
			<lb />
			with the provisions of the amended Act, &quot;if limitation for it survives&quot;.
			<lb />
			44
			<lb />
			As submitted by Mr. Mistri, with whom we agree, Chapter II of
			<lb />
			Relaxation Act provide for -&quot;Relaxation of Certain Provisions of Specified
			<lb />
			Act&quot;and Section 3 forms part of this Chapter. Further Chapter III provides
			<lb />
			for amendment to Income Tax Act, 1961 and various Sections of the Act
			<lb />
			have been amended in Chapter III. From this the following propositions

			emerge :
			<lb />
			(a) Wherever the Parliament thought fit, the Parliament has
			<lb />
			itself amended the provision of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and not left it for
			<lb />
			the CBDT to make the amendment. Therefore, it is clear that no power is
			<lb />
			given under Relaxation Act to postpone the applicability of provisions of the
			<lb />
			Income Tax Act.
			<lb />
			(b) Chapter II of Relaxation Act is only for &apos;Relaxation of
			<lb />
			Certain Provisions of Specified Act&apos; and, therefore, there is no question of
			<lb />
			the Revenue relying on this Chapter and Section 3 to justify the
			<lb />
			postponement of applicability of certain provisions of the Income Tax Act. If
			<lb />
			the Parliament wanted to give some right to the CBDT, it would have formed
			<lb />
			part of Chapter III, however, there is no such provision in Chapter III of the
			<lb />
			Act.
			<lb />
			45
			<lb />
			As submitted by Mr. Pardiwalla there are other Sections in the
			<lb />
			Finance Act, 2021 which have amended other provisions of the Income Tax
			<lb />
			Act from dates other than 1 st April, 2021. Like for example Section 12 of the
			<lb />
			Finance Act inserted a proviso in Section 43CA. Had the intention of the
			<lb />
			legislature, while amending Sections 147 to 153, been to give it effect from
			<lb />
			1 st July, 2021, a similar savings clause could have been inserted, which has
			<lb />
			not been done. We agree with Mr. Pardiwalla because as per Section 1(2)(a)
			<lb />
			of the Finance Act, 2021, the amendments to Sections 147 to 153 of the Act
			<lb />
			shall come into force on 1 st April, 2021. Similarly, the Memorandum

			explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2021 clarifies that these
			<lb />
			amendments will take effect from 1 st April, 2021. Section 12 of the Finance
			<lb />
			Act inserted a proviso in Section 43CA which inter alia provides that the
			<lb />
			words &apos;one hundred and ten percent&apos; in the first proviso will be substituted
			<lb />
			by the words &apos;one hundred and twenty percent&apos; if the transfer of residential
			<lb />
			units takes place during the period beginning from 12 th day of November,
			<lb />
			2020 and ending on the 30 th day of June, 2021. Therefore, had the intention
			<lb />
			of the legislature, while amending Sections 147 to 153, was to give it effect
			<lb />
			from 1 st July, 2021, a similar savings clause could have been inserted, which
			<lb />
			has not been done.
			<lb />
			46
			<lb />
			Mr. Pardiwalla submitted that only Section 4 of Relaxation Act
			<lb />
			which amended the Act and no such amendments to the substantive
			<lb />
			provisions of the Act were envisaged under Section 3 of Relaxation Act,
			<lb />
			which was only a relaxation provision dealing with time limits under various
			<lb />
			enactments.
			<lb />
			47
			<lb />
			As noted earlier, it is Revenue&apos;s case that Section 3 of Relaxation
			<lb />
			Act enabled the Central Government to issue notifications which would
			<lb />
			permit the Assessing Officers to issue notices under Section 148 of the Act
			<lb />
			after 1 st April, 2021 in terms of the erstwhile provisions of Sections 147 to
			<lb />
			section 151, even though the said provisions were repealed with effect from

			1 st April, 2021 by the Finance Act, 2021. It is, however, pertinent to note

			that Section 3 of Relaxation Act falls in Chapter II of the said Act, which is
			<lb />
			titled &apos;Relaxation of Certain Provisions of Specified Act&apos;. In contradistinction,
			<lb />
			Section 4 of Relaxation Act which does amend several provisions of the Act
			<lb />
			falls in Chapter III, which is titled &apos; Amendments to the Income Tax Act,
			<lb />
			1961&apos;. It will be apposite to notice that the amendments provided for in
			<lb />
			Section 4 were made by the Legislature itself in terms of the said Section
			<lb />
			and no such power to amend the Act was delegated to the Central
			<lb />
			Government. Therefore, we would agree with Mr. Pardiwalla that it is only
			<lb />
			Section 4 of Relaxation Act which amended the Act and no such
			<lb />
			amendments to the substantive provisions of the Act were envisaged under

			Section 3 of Relaxation Act, which was only a relaxation provision dealing

			with time limits under various enactments.

			<lb />
			Mr. Pardiwalla submitted that even assuming for a moment that
			<lb />
			the primary contention of petitioners that the Explanations in the
			<lb />
			notifications are invalid is not accepted, still the impugned notices will be
			<lb />
			bad in law as the Explanation only seeks to effectuate the provisions of the
			<lb />
			erstwhile Sections 148, 149 and 151 of the Act. It does not cover the
			<lb />
			erstwhile Section 147 of the Act. As rightly submitted by Mr. Pardiwalla, the
			<lb />
			Assessing Officer could have assumed jurisdiction while issuing the
			<lb />
			impugned notices only after complying with the amended Section 147. The
			<lb />
			same has not been done by the Assessing Officers as (a) his assumption of

			jurisdiction is on the basis of his &apos;reason to believe&apos; that income chargeable
			<lb />
			to tax has escaped assessment, a concept, which is no longer recognised in
			<lb />
			the amended Section 147; and (b) the amended Section 147 is in any event
			<lb />
			subject to Sections 148 to 153, which would also include the procedure
			<lb />
			contained in Section 148A, which has not been followed. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			impugned notices do not even comply with the relevant statutory provisions,
			<lb />
			even if we do not find fault with the Explanations in the two notifications.
			<lb />
			Infact the Delhi High Court in paragraph 84 of Mon Mohan Kohli (Supra)
			<lb />
			has also considered and accepted this aspect of the matter.
			<lb />
			49
			<lb />
			Some more reasons why the reopening notices must go are :
			<lb />
			(a) Section 297 of the Act provides a saving clause for
			<lb />
			applicability of various provisions of the 1922 Act, even though the Act itself
			<lb />
			had been repealed. In the absence of such a saving clause for applicability of
			<lb />
			erstwhile Sections 147 to 151 of the Act, the amended provision of the Act
			<lb />
			would apply from 1 st April, 2021.
			<lb />
			(b) Moreover, the reopening notices issued after 1 st April, 2021
			<lb />
			are bad in law even if one was to apply the Explanations to the Notification
			<lb />
			Nos.20 and 38. The Explanations seek to extend the applicability of
			<lb />
			erstwhile Sections 148, 149 and 151. They do not cover Section 147, which
			<lb />
			empowers revenue to reopen subject to Section 148 to 153, which includes
			<lb />
			Section 148A. Thus, even if Explanation are valid, procedure of Section
			<lb />
			148A is not followed and hence, notices are invalid.

			(c) In any case, Relaxation Act is not applicable for Assessment
			<lb />
			Years 2015-2016 or any subsequent year and, hence, the question of
			<lb />
			applicability of the Notification Nos.20 and 38 of 2021 does not arise. The
			<lb />
			time limit to issue notice under Section 148 of the Act for the Assessment
			<lb />
			Years 2015-2016 onwards was not expiring within the period for which
			<lb />
			Section 3(1) of Relaxation Act was applicable and, hence, Relaxation Act
			<lb />
			could never apply for these assessment years. As a consequence, there can
			<lb />
			be no question of extending the period of limitation for such assessment
			<lb />
			years.
			<lb />
			50
			<lb />
			To sum up, since we are in respectful agreement with the
			<lb />
			reasons recorded and views taken by the Allahabad High Court, Rajasthan
			<lb />
			High Court, Delhi High Court and Madras High Court, in the cases referred
			<lb />
			hereinabove, and for reasons noted above, all these writ petitions listed
			<lb />
			above are disposed by allowing the same. The explanations to the
			<lb />
			Notification No.20 of 2021 dated 31 st March 2021 and Notification No.38 of
			<lb />
			2021 dated 27 th April 2021 are declared ultra vires and are, therefore, bad
			<lb />
			in law and null and void.
			<lb />
			51
			<lb />
			All the impugned notices issued under Section 148 of the Act
			<lb />
			are quashed and set aside.
			<lb />
			52
			<lb />
			It will be open to the Assessing Officers concerned to initiate
