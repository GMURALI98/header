			Una, in Civil Suit No.99/2003 has been reversed, with a prayer to
			<lb />
			set aside the same and to restore the judgment and decree passed
			<lb />
			by the learned Trial Court.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			The brief facts giving rise to the present appeal are:
			<lb />
			that the Appellant/respondent (hereinafter to be
			<lb />
			called as &quot;the appellant&quot;) maintained a suit for posession by way
			<lb />
			of eviction and recovery of Rs.14,000/ on the contention that he
			<lb />
			is the owner of the premises in the lis and the same was let out
			<lb />
			by him to the respondent/plaintiff (hereinafter to be called as &quot;the
			<lb />
			respondent&quot;) on a monthly rent of Rs.500/ in the month of June,
			<lb />
			1995. As per the plaintiff/respondent, the rent has not been paid
			<lb />
			from June, 2001 to April, 2003 and, thus, the appellant is in
			<lb />
			arrears of rent. Further, that the tenancy of the respondent was
			<lb />
			terminated by a notice.
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			The defendant contested the suit and averred that the
			<lb />
			land underneath the shop was given on lease on a monthly lease
			<lb />
			money of Rs.10/ and the same was enhanced to Rs.50/. Further,
			<lb />
			that after getting land on lease, the respondent raised super
			<lb />
			structure with his own funds and at that time, it was agreed by
			<lb />
			the predecessorininterest of the plaintiff/respondent that lease

			is of permanent nature and so long the defendant pays the lease
			<lb />
			money, he would not be evicted. As per the defendant, the
			<lb />
			allegation of the plaintiff, that the shop in question was rented
			<lb />
			out by the appellant on 01.6.1995, altogether is wrong and false.
			<lb />
			It has been pleaded that the lease money has been paid to the
			<lb />
			plaintiff till April, 2003.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			The learned Trial Court, on completion of the
			<lb />
			pleadings and after recording the evidence, dismissed the suit
			<lb />
			holding that the plaintiff, though owner of the land, has failed to
			<lb />
			prove that the premises was let out to the appellant on a monthly
			<lb />
			rent of Rs.500/ w.e.f. 01.6.1995 and the termination of the
			<lb />
			tenancy and the recovery of the arrears has been held to be not
			<lb />
			tenable.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			The learned District Judge, while setting aside the
			<lb />
			reasoned and balanced judgment of the learned Trial Court,
			<lb />
			decreed the suit. The learned District Judge has held that the
			<lb />
			rent is Rs.100/ per month and the appellant is in arrears of rent
			<lb />
			since 01.1.2001 and while passing the decree of possession by
			<lb />
			eviction, a decree for recovery of Rs.9,600/ was also passed.

			<lb />
			On the pleadings of the parties, the learned Trial
			<lb />
			Court framed the following issues :
			<lb />
			&quot;1. Whether the shop doneted by letters ABCD
			<lb />
			shown red in the site plan are owned by the
			<lb />
			plaintiff as alleged?
			<lb />
			...
			<lb />
			… OPP
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			Whether the defendant took aforesaid shops on
			<lb />
			rent at the rat eof Rs.500/ per month from the
			<lb />
			plaintiff since 1.6.1995, as alleged?
			<lb />
			...
			<lb />
			… OPD
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			Whether the suit is not maintainable?
			<lb />
			...
			<lb />
			… OPD
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			Whether the tenancy of the defendant has been
			<lb />
			validly terminated by the plaintiff vide notice
			<lb />
			dated 8.5.2003?
			<lb />
			...
			<lb />
			… OPP
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of
			<lb />
			possession, as claimed?
			<lb />
			...
			<lb />
			… OPP
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			Whether the site underneath the shops was
			<lb />
			taken on lease of Rs. 10/ per month, which
			<lb />
			stands enhanced now to Rs.50/ per month, as
			<lb />
			alleged. If so, its effect?
			<lb />
			...
			<lb />
			… OPD
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />

			7.
			<lb />
			The learned Trial Court decided Issue No.1 in favour
			<lb />
			of the plaintiff and Issues No.2 to 5 against the plaintiff and
			<lb />
			Issues No.6 and 7 against the defendants and dismissed the suit.
			<lb />
			8.
			<lb />
			The defendants maintained the appeal before the
			<lb />
			learned Lower Appellate Court, which was allowed and the
			<lb />
			judgment and decree passed by the learned Trial Court was set
			<lb />
			aside. Hence, the present regular second appeal, which was
			<lb />
			admitted on 20.4.2010, on the following substantial question of
			<lb />
			law:
			<lb />
			&quot;1. Whether the findings of the learned
			<lb />
			trial Court as well as first Appellate Court
			<lb />
			are result of complete misreading and
			<lb />
			misinterpretation of the evidence and
			<lb />
			material on record and against the settled
			<lb />
			position of law?&quot;
			<lb />
			9.
			<lb />
			I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and
			<lb />
			have also gone through the record.
			<lb />
			10.
			<lb />
			Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant/respondent
			<lb />
			has argued that the judgment and decree passed by the learned
			<lb />
			Lower Appellate Court is without appreciating the facts, which
			<lb />
			have come on record to its true perspective and the same is
			<lb />
			required to be set aside. He has further argued that it was
			<lb />
			incumbent upon the learned Lower Appellate Court to give

		<body>
			findings on each and every aspect, but the learned Appellate
			<lb />
			Court has failed to do so.
			<lb />
			11.
			<lb />
			On the other hand, the learned Senior Counsel
			<lb />
			appearing for the respondent/defendant has argued that the
			<lb />
			judgment and decree passed by the learned Lower Appellate
			<lb />
			Court is just and reasoned and requires no intereference. He
			<lb />
			has further argued that the learned Trial Court has given its
			<lb />
			findings on each and every aspect in detail and no interference is
			<lb />
			required to be taken at this moment.
			<lb />
			12.
			<lb />
			In rebuttal, the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			apellant/plaintiff has argued that there is substantial question of
			<lb />
			law involved, which needs to be adjudicated upon. He has further
			<lb />
			argued that the appeal be allowed.
			<lb />
			13.
			<lb />
			To appreciate the arguments of the learned counsel
			<lb />
			for the parties, I have gone through the record of the case, in
			<lb />
			detail.
			<lb />
			14.
			<lb />
			PW1 Piara Singh had stated that he had been the
			<lb />
			owner of the shop in dispute and he had rented out the shop to
			<lb />
			the defendant on monthly rent of Rs.500/ w.e.f. 01.06.1995 and
			<lb />
			that the appellant/defendant had not paid the rent w.e.f.
			<lb />
			01.01.2001. He has further stated that his son was without any

			job and he wanted to settle him and on this ground he had sought
			<lb />
			eviction of the defendant. However, the defendant despite receipt
			<lb />
			of notice, did not vacate the premises nor had paid any rent. The
			<lb />
			evidence of this PW had been endorsed and supported by PW2
			<lb />
			Bakhshish Singh and PW3 Darshan Singh.
			<lb />
			15.
			<lb />
			PW4 had prepared the site plan of the premises,
			<lb />
			Ext.PW4/A and against the said evidence of the plaintiff, the
			<lb />
			defendant, including himself, had examined seven DWs.
			<lb />
			DW1 Ramesh Chand, MHC had tendered in evidence report,
			<lb />
			Ext. DX, of Daily Diary of Police Post, Haroli on 24.01.1995. It
			<lb />
			has been submitted that the premises in dispute had been
			<lb />
			partially affected by fire on the night intervening 23.01.1995 and
			<lb />
			24.01.1995. DW2 Sarvan Singh was an official of HPSEB. During
			<lb />
			his examination, he has stated that premises in dispute stood
			<lb />
			provided power connection on and w.e.f. 20.07.1993. DW3,
			<lb />
			Ramesh Kumar was an official of Weights and Measures
			<lb />
			Department. DW3 had stated that the defendant had been issued
			<lb />
			certificate/rectipt Ext. DW3/A on 17.05.1985 and the Weights of
			<lb />
			the defendant had been certified by the then Inspector, Weights
			<lb />
			and Measures Department. DW4 Pawan Kumar and DW7
			<lb />
			Dharam Pal had stated that the defendant had been doing

			business of food article and the local health authorities had issued
			<lb />
			licence Ext.DW4/A and DW7/A in favour fo the defendant in the
			<lb />
			year 198889. DW5 Bhajan Singh had stated that defendant had
			<lb />
			construted the premises in dispute sometimes in the year 196667
			<lb />
			and the defendant had been doing business. The defendant had
			<lb />
			not taken the premises in question on rent from the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			DW6 Charna (appellant herein) had controverted the evidence of
			<lb />
			the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			16.
			<lb />
			When the notice was issued to the defendant by the
			<lb />
			plaintiff, he has mentioned that the shop, in question, was given
			<lb />
			to him on rent in the year 1995 at the rate of Rs.500/ per month,
			<lb />
			but this fact found to be not correct as the defendant was running
			<lb />
			the shop as per the witness of the plaintiff itself, i.e. PW4 from
			<lb />
			the year 1985. The specific stand of the defendant that he had
			<lb />
			constructed the shop consisting two rooms on the leased land
			<lb />
			belonging to the plaintiff is not specifically controverted in the
			<lb />
			replication. At the same point of time, the Government
			<lb />
			Departments have given Licence Ext.DW7/A and Ext. DW7/B for
			<lb />
			sale of food, Tea &amp; Sweets in the premises at Pubowal in the year
			<lb />
			198889. The Weights and Measures Department has certified

			the weights and measures of the defendant in the year, 1985 vide
			<lb />
			Ext.DW3/A.
			<lb />
			17.
			<lb />
			Now, to the &apos;Rapt&apos; with regard to the fire. The
			<lb />
			Rapat mark &apos;DX&apos; shows that on 23.01.1995, there was fire in the
			<lb />
			shop, but after analysing mark DX, it is found that the fire
			<lb />
			destroyed (Khahadposh) big grass roofed verandah of the shop
			<lb />
			where the Benches were kept and on one side, was a &apos;Bhatti&apos; and
			<lb />
			the loss was about to Rs.3,000/ only. It seems that the plaintiff
			<lb />
			has taken the cause from this time onward, but the shop having
			<lb />
			two rooms remained intact as per the perusal of mark DX. This
			<lb />
			all shows that had the shop been given to the defendant on rent
			<lb />
			prior to the year 1985, the plaintiff would have again asked the
			<lb />
			defendant for the rent from the year 1985, if not paid, but he has
			<lb />
			contested his case from the year 1995, but the facts on record
			<lb />
			clearly shows that the shop having two rooms was with the
			<lb />
			defendant prior to the year 1995. As per the defendant, he has
			<lb />
			constructed the shop and there is no clear denial by the plaintiff
			<lb />
			in the replication to this effect. The plaintiff has not stated that
			<lb />
			when the shop was constructed; by whom shop was construcred
			<lb />
			and who was keeping the shop in question before the year 1995.
			<lb />
			In these circumstances, the version of the plaintiff is not reliable

			at all and the version of the defendant is reliable. Hence, the
			<lb />
			findings recorded by the learned Lower Appellate Court are, thus,
			<lb />
			without any basis.
			<lb />
			18.
			<lb />
			This Court finds that the findings recorded by the
			<lb />
			learned Appellate Court are perverse and so, the findings as
			<lb />
			recorded by the learned Appellate Court are not sustainable in
			<lb />
			the eyes of law. In these circumstances, this Court comes to the
			<lb />
			conclusion that the findings of the learned Lower Appellate Court
			<lb />
			are perverse. So, the substantial question of law, as framed, is
			<lb />
			answered accordingly.
			<lb />
			19.
			<lb />
			The net result of the above discussion is that the
			<lb />
			appeal is required to be allowed, which is allowed and the
			<lb />
			judgment and decree passed by the learned Lower Appellate
			<lb />
			Court is set aside and that of the learned Trial Court is affirmed.
			<lb />
			Pending application(s) if any, also stands disposed of. No costs.
