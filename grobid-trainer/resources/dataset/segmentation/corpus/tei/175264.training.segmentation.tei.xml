			the learned Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal,
			<lb />
			Kolkata was justified in dismissing the appeal filed by the petitioner on

			the ground that while filing the appeal before the Appellate Tribunal,

			the petitioner did not deposit the amount as required under Section

			<lb />
			is misconceived. Accordingly, I.A no.05/2020 stands dismissed.
