			08.03.2021 personal hearing notice, learned counsel submits
			<lb />
			that writ petitioner had sent a detailed reply dated 11.03.2021,
			<lb />
			saying that Covid-19 situation and the lock down is delaying
			<lb />
			the collection of 15 year old documents and some time has
			<lb />
			been requested, but notwithstanding the same the impugned
			<lb />
			orders have been passed without giving personal hearing.
			<lb />
			6. Ms.Amirta Dinakaran, learned Revenue counsel
			<lb />
			accepts notice on behalf of sole respondent and requests for a
			<lb />
			short accommodation to get instructions.
			<lb />
			List in the Admission Board day after tomorrow i.e.,

			captioned writ petitions and Ms.Amirta Dinakaran, learned Revenue
			<lb />
			counsel for the lone respondent in both the captioned writ petitions are
			<lb />
			before me.
			<lb />
			3. Before proceeding further, regarding paragraph 3 of previous
			<lb />
			proceedings dated 13.09.2021, I deem it appropriate to make it clear that
			<lb />
			the impugned order in the senior WP, which has been made under CST
			<lb />
			Act is under Section 12 of CST Act read with Section 9(2A) of CST Act,

			<lb />

		<body>
			whereas, impugned order in junior WP has been made under Section 12
			<lb />
			per se of TNGST Act. To this extent, paragraph 3 of the previous
			<lb />
			proceedings shall stand corrected.
			<lb />
			4. Reverting to the core issue i.e., issue captured in the previous
			<lb />
			proceedings, learned Revenue counsel, on instructions submits that the
			<lb />
			first notice dated 11.12.2020 was returned &apos;unserved&apos; and to the second
			<lb />
			notice dated 08.03.2021, writ petitioner did respond citing the Covid-19
			<lb />
			situation and sought time. In other words, there is no disputation that the
			<lb />
			first notice dated 11.12.2020 was made available to the writ petitioner
			<lb />
			only on 27.07.2021 post impugned order.
			<lb />
			5. Regarding service of notices, the applicable Rules are the &apos;Tamil
			<lb />
			Nadu General Sales Tax Rules, 1959&apos; [hereinafter &apos;TNGST Rules&apos; for the
			<lb />
			sake of convenience]. To be noted, this Court is informed without any
			<lb />
			disputation or disagreement that TNGST Rules is applicable with regard
			<lb />
			to proceedings under CST Act also. The Rules that deals with services of
			<lb />
			notices is Rule 52 and the relevant Rule in this case is 52(1)(d), which
			<lb />
			reads as follows:

			of any notice, summons or order under the Act or these rules
			<lb />
			may be effected in any of the following ways, namely:-

			R.52(1)(a) ..............
			<lb />
			R.52(1)(b) ..............

			R.52(1)(d) if none of the modes aforesaid is practicable,
			<lb />
			by affixing it in some conspicuous place at his last known place
			<lb />
			of business or residence.&apos;
			<lb />
			6. In the case on hand, there is no disputation that there was no
			<lb />
			affixure much less affixure in the conspicuous place at his last known
			<lb />
			place of business/residence qua writ petitioner. Therefore, there was no
			<lb />
			service of notice as far as the 11.12.2020 notice is concerned. Therefore,
			<lb />
			following order is passed:
			<lb />
			a) Impugned orders being orders (both) dated
			<lb />
			30.06.2021 bearing reference CST:676385/2004-05 and
			<lb />
			TNGST:3261190/2004-05 respectively are set aside solely on
			<lb />
			the ground that pre order notices have not been served in
			<lb />
			accordance with TNGST Rules;
			<lb />
			b) Though obvious, it is made clear that the impugned
			<lb />
			orders are set aside solely on the ground that pre order notices
