			3.The contents of the memo are reiterated in the hearing
			<lb />
			today.
			<lb />
			4.The writ petitions are of the year 2006 and they have been
			<lb />
			filed on 20.01.2006 to be precise. This means that the writ petitions
			<lb />
			are more than one and half decades old i.e., more than 15 years
			<lb />
			old.
			<lb />
			5.Be that as it may, learned Revenue counsel pointed out that
			<lb />
			nothing really survives in the captioned matter as the issue

			pertaining to entry tax and imported cars has been decided by a
			<lb />
			Hon&apos;ble Division Bench in V.Krishnamurthy Vs. State of Tamil
			<lb />
			Nadu and Others reported in 2019 SCC Online Mad 8523 and
			<lb />
			the captioned matter is squarely covered by the same.
			<lb />
			6.In the light of the aforementioned narrative, captioned writ
			<lb />
			petitions are dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
			<lb />
			Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
