			1.
			<lb />
			The extension of tenure of Production Sharing Contract dated
			<lb />
			15.5.1995 (hereafter referred to as &quot;PSC&quot;) qua the Rajasthan Block RJ-ON-
			<lb />
			90/1 (hereafter referred to as &quot;Rajasthan Block&quot;) for a period of 10 years
			<lb />
			beyond its current term is at the heart of the matter.
			<lb />
			1.1 The present tenure of the PSC comes to an end on 14.5.2020. The
			<lb />
			petitioners seek the extension of the tenure of the PSC for a further period
			<lb />

		<body>
			of 10 years i.e., till 14.5.2030. This right, the petitioners claim, based on
			<lb />
			the provisions of Article 2.1 of the PSC.
			<lb />
			1.2 It is the stand of the petitioners that the extension of tenure of the
			<lb />
			PSC is required to take place without alteration of the subsisting terms.
			<lb />
			The petitioners claim that the mutuality envisaged under Article 2.1 of the
			<lb />
			PSC pertains to the periods in issue and not qua financial terms already
			<lb />
			agreed to by respondent no.1 and 2.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			Therefore, much would turn upon how Article 2.1 of the PSCs is
			<lb />
			construed. Thus, for the sake of convenience, Article 2.1 of the PSCs is
			<lb />
			extracted hereafter:
			<lb />
			&quot;The term of this Contract, subject to the terms hereof and the
			<lb />
			applicable laws, shall be for a period of twenty five (25) years
			<lb />
			from the Effective Date, unless the Contract is terminated
			<lb />
			earlier in accordance with its terms, but may be extended
			<lb />
			upon mutual agreement between the Parties for a further
			<lb />
			Period not exceeding five (5) years; provided that in the event
			<lb />
			of Commercial Production of Natural Gas, which is expected
			<lb />
			to continue beyond the end of the term of the Contract, the
			<lb />
			Contract shall be extended for such a period up to but not
			<lb />
			exceeding thirty five (35) years from the Effective Date, as
			<lb />
			may be mutually agreed between the Parties to be sufficient to
			<lb />
			permit the Contractor to maximize the production of Natural
			<lb />
			Gas in accordance with good petroleum industry practice. If
			<lb />
			the production of Crude Oil or of Natural Gas is expected to
			<lb />
			continue beyond the end of the relevant period referred to
			<lb />
			above, the Parties may agree to extend this Contract for a
			<lb />
			further period upon such terms as may be mutually agreed.&quot;
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			Respondent no.1 and 2, who are charged with the responsibility of
			<lb />
			taking a decision on the extension of the tenure of the PSC, resist the same,
			<lb />
			on the ground that during the pendency of the writ petition, a New Policy
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />
		</note>
		<page>
			Page 2 of 56
			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			stood framed, and therefore, grant of extension can only be on the terms
			<lb />
			and conditions stipulated therein. This policy, which was framed on
			<lb />
			07.04.2017 (hereafter referred to as &quot;New Policy&quot;) according to respondent
			<lb />
			no. 1 and 2 should form the basis for extension of the PSC.
			<lb />
			3.1 According to respondents no. 1 and 2, the New Policy provides for a
			<lb />
			transparent and defined framework for granting extension to operational
			<lb />
			Pre-New Exploration Licensing Policy (Pre-NELP) exploratory PSCs. The
			<lb />
			New Policy, thus, as per the stand of the respondent no.1 and 2, provides a
			<lb />
			level playing field to all contractors, who had secured for themselves Pre-
			<lb />
			NELP blocks for exploration.
			<lb />
			3.2 It is the stand of respondent no. 1 and 2 that, the Government of
			<lb />
			India (GOI) is the owner of natural resources and, thus, holds sway over
			<lb />
			the exploration blocks in the larger interest of the people of India.
			<lb />
			3.3 The logical sequitur of this argument is that the GOI cannot be
			<lb />
			divested of its supervisory power in matters pertaining to national
			<lb />
			importance.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			This, in effect, is the stand of respondent no. 1 and 2 on merits.
			<lb />
			Thus, in line with the foregoing submission it is stated, on behalf of
			<lb />
			respondent no.1 and 2 that the petitioners&apos; were advised vide letter dated
			<lb />
			12.04.2017 to submit a formal application to seek approval of the extension
			<lb />
			of the PSC tenure in accordance with the New Policy framework.
			<lb />
			4.1 The respondent no.1 and 2, thus, take the line that the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;mutual agreement&quot; obtaining in Article 2.1 of the PSC would mean that
			<lb />
			extension can only be granted in terms of the New Policy.

			5.
			<lb />
			This apart the respondent no.1 and 2 take the objection that no writ
			<lb />
			petition would lie in respect of rights and obligation which are rooted in a
			<lb />
			contract.
			<lb />
			5.1 In this behalf, respondent no.1 and 2 have referred to the order dated
			<lb />
			14.12.2015, when, while issuing notice in the writ petition, this aspect was
			<lb />
			taken note of.
			<lb />
			Background Facts:
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			Therefore, before I proceed to deal with the issues raised in the writ
			<lb />
			petition, I propose to set out the following broad facts which form the
			<lb />
			background in which the instant dispute has arisen between the parties.
			<lb />
			6.1 On 15.5.1995, when, the PSC was first executed, there were two
			<lb />
			parties to the contract, i.e., ONGC and Shell India Production Development
			<lb />
			NV (hereafter referred to as &quot;Shell&quot;). At this point of time, Shell had 100%
			<lb />
			participating interest in the Rajasthan Block. Via an addendum dated
			<lb />
			07.06.2000, Shell assigned 50% of its participating interest in the Rajasthan
			<lb />
			Block in favour of an entity by the name of: Cairn Energy India Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			(&quot;CEIL&quot;).
			<lb />
			6.2 On 27.07.2004, Shell assigned the remaining 50% of its participating
			<lb />
			interest in the Rajasthan Block in favour of petitioner no.3/ CEHL. This
			<lb />
			was captured in Amendment no.2 to the PSC.
			<lb />
			6.3 Since, GOI decided to exercise its back-in-option under the PSC,
			<lb />
			ONGC was nominated to hold 30% of the participating interest in the
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block. Accordingly, at that juncture, the participating interest in
			<lb />
			the Rajasthan Block was spread out as follows:
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />
		</note>
		<page>
			Page 4 of 56
			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			(i) While Petitioner no.3 and CEIL held 35% each of the participating
			<lb />
			interest, the balance 30% was held by ONGC.
			<lb />
			6.4 This arrangement underwent a change when on 18.10.2012, GOI
			<lb />
			allowed CEIL to assign its entire participating interest in favour of
			<lb />
			petitioner no.1/ CIL. This apart, a change in operatorship was also brought
			<lb />
			about. Consequently, petitioner no.1 acquired 35% participating interest in
			<lb />
			the Rajasthan Block and, was also, designated as the operator under the
			<lb />
			PSC. In this capacity, petitioner no.1 was required to act on behalf of its
			<lb />
			joint venture partners. Thus, in effect, at present, the participating interest
			<lb />
			in the Rajasthan Block is shared in the following manner:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			Petitioner no.1 and 3 hold 35 % each of the participating interest,
			<lb />
			while ONGC holds 30%.
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />
			It is the case of the petitioners that though the PSC was executed as
			<lb />
			far back in May, 1995, the delay in commencement of production of crude
			<lb />
			oil and natural gas was attributable to respondent no. 1 and 2. Though a
			<lb />
			chart in that behalf comprising of dates and events has been appended to
			<lb />
			the writ petition, it is not necessary to discuss the same in detail in view of
			<lb />
			the nature of the controversy at hand.
			<lb />
			8.
			<lb />
			Suffice it to say that according to the petitioners, on 15.09.2004,
			<lb />
			&quot;Commercial Discovery&quot; at Rajasthan Block was made which led to
			<lb />
			commercial production of crude oil, in 2009.
			<lb />
			8.1 It is the case of the petitioners that, with the use of sound industry
			<lb />
			practices and latest technology, they were able to make 25 hydrocarbon
			<lb />
			discoveries in the Rajasthan Block.
			<lb />

			9.
			<lb />
			The petitioners&apos; claim that they have made an additional investment
			<lb />
			of USD 4 billion towards development of fields and construction of pipe
			<lb />
			lines. It is the petitioners&quot; say that there is considerable potential in the
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block provided latest petroleum industry practices are employed.
			<lb />
			It is also the petitioners&apos; assessment, that estimated recoverable reserves in
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block is approximately 1.2 billion Barrels of Oil Equivalent
			<lb />
			(&quot;BOE&quot;). Furthermore, according to the petitioners, out of this reserve, 466
			<lb />
			million BOE can be recovered if the tenure of the existing PSC is extended
			<lb />
			till 2030.
			<lb />
			9.1 The petitioner no. 1 &amp; 3 claim that they have uptil now invested in
			<lb />
			the Rajasthan Block moneys in excess of the Rs.30,000/-crores.
			<lb />
			9.2
			<lb />
			It is also the say of the petitioners that currently GOI&quot;s revenue
			<lb />
			which includes its nominee/licensee is, approximately, 60-70% of the
			<lb />
			prevailing price; which includes the revenue from &quot;Profit Petroleum&quot;,
			<lb />
			royalty, and cess.
			<lb />
			10. It is in this background that on, 15.01.2009, petitioner no.1 made a
			<lb />
			representation to respondent no.2 to extend the PSC tenure by 20 years i.e.,
			<lb />
			up to 14.05.2040. In this communication, petitioner no.1, inter alia,
			<lb />
			indicated to respondent no.2, that if, enhanced oil recovery methods were
			<lb />
			used in addition to conventional recoveries schemes, it had the potential of
			<lb />
			increasing the expected ultimate recovery by 10-20% of Stock-Tank Oil
			<lb />
			Initially In Place (hereafter referred to as &quot;STOIIP&quot;).
			<lb />
			10.1 In response thereto, vide communication dated 21.03.2009,
			<lb />
			respondent no.2 requested petitioner no.1 to submit long term production
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			profiles of the Rajasthan Block to establish that the production line of the
			<lb />
			said block would continue beyond the current tenure of the PSC.
			<lb />
			Furthermore, petitioner no.1 was also told to furnish detailed break-up of
			<lb />
			additional investment which was required to be made in the Rajasthan
			<lb />
			block.
			<lb />
			10.2 In response thereto, petitioner no.1 vide its communication dated
			<lb />
			06.03.2009 provided the production profile and proposed investment,
			<lb />
			which, incidentally, was factored for development of both, existing
			<lb />
			discoveries and future potential of the Rajasthan Block.
			<lb />
			11. Having received the requisite information from petitioner no.1,
			<lb />
			respondent no. 2 did a wee bit of U-turn by indicating to it via its
			<lb />
			communication dated 31.03.2009 that it was in the process of framing
			<lb />
			policy guidelines qua extension of PSCs beyond the initial contractual
			<lb />
			period. In this behalf, reference was also made to Article 2.1 of the PSC.
			<lb />
			12. Pertinently, in view of the fact that no permission was granted to
			<lb />
			conduct further exploration activities in the Rajasthan Block beyond the
			<lb />
			exploration phase, further exploratory development could not be
			<lb />
			undertaken.
			<lb />
			13. It is the petitioners&quot; say that, since, GOI issued office memorandum
			<lb />
			dated 1.2.2013 permitting contractors under PSCs to undertake further
			<lb />
			exploratory activities, in the mining areas, beyond the initial exploration
			<lb />
			period, albeit, on certain terms and conditions (such as Government&quot;s share
			<lb />
			of petroleum profits was not impacted), they recommenced their
			<lb />
			exploratory activities in the Rajasthan Block.

			13.1 It is in this context that on 05.04.2013, petitioner no.1 wrote to
			<lb />
			respondent no.1 that, while the known commercial production profile of the
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block extends beyond 2040, in terms of Article 2.1 of the PSC,
			<lb />
			extension by a period of 10 years beyond 2020 would suffice. The relevant
			<lb />
			observation made in this communication is extracted hereafter for the sake
			<lb />
			of convenience:
			<lb />
			&quot;At this point in time the PSC term is valid till 14 May 2020
			<lb />
			while the known commercial production profile extends
			<lb />
			beyond 2040. Also while all the stakeholders believe in the
			<lb />
			further and huge potential of the block, we are keen and
			<lb />
			ready to proceed with huge investments to find more and
			<lb />
			more hydrocarbons. We will be able to firm up our
			<lb />
			investment and action plans and with reasonable certainty
			<lb />
			once the PSC term is formally extended.
			<lb />
			The RJ-ON-90/1 PSC (pre NELP PSC) has been
			<lb />
			contemplated extension of PSC term vide Art 2.1. It initially
			<lb />
			provides for 5 years extension on general merit basis and in
			<lb />
			the alternative 10 years extension if gas sales profile is
			<lb />
			extending beyond 2020. It also provides for subsequent
			<lb />
			extension for indefinite period. In the present case 10 years
			<lb />
			extension is applicable. In respect of this 10 years extension
			<lb />
			Art 2.1 uses the expression &quot;shall&quot; which is very significant
			<lb />
			and positive. Art 2.1 also contemplates mutual agreement for
			<lb />
			such extension and hence we hereby convey our agreement
			<lb />
			for the same.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis is mine)
			<lb />
			14. Happily, since certain fields in the Rajasthan Block were also
			<lb />
			producing natural gas along with crude oil, albeit, in excess of its
			<lb />
			operational needs, petitioner no.1 sought permission to sell excess
			<lb />
			quantities of natural gas, so produced, for a period up to 2 years. This
			<lb />
			permission was sought by petitioner no. 1 vide its communication dated
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015

			30.01.2013 addressed to respondent no.1/GOI. The request was reiterated
			<lb />
			by petitioner no.1 vide communication dated 18.02.2013 and 12.03.2013.
			<lb />
			14.1 Consequent thereto, GOI vide letters dated 28.03.2013 and
			<lb />
			23.04.2013 accorded its approval for sale of gas to Gujarat Narmada valley
			<lb />
			Fertilizers and chemical ltd (&quot;GNVFC&quot;) limited though to the extent of
			<lb />
			0.10 mmscmd.
			<lb />
			15. In view of the fact that the production was better than expected and
			<lb />
			there was lesser consumption of gas, petitioner no.1 vide letter dated
			<lb />
			20.5.2013 sought approval to increase the volume of gas to be sold to
			<lb />
			GNVFC from 0.10 mmscmd to 0.2 mmscmd. This request was made, once
			<lb />
			again, vide letter dated 20.11.2013; though this time around approval was
			<lb />
			sought to sell 0.35 mmscmd volume of gas to GNVFC.
			<lb />
			16. As a matter of fact, via letter dated 02.07.2014, petitioner no. 1
			<lb />
			sought approval of GOI to sell gas beyond the test period to avoid shutting
			<lb />
			off wells, pending approval of Field Development Plan (&quot;FDP&quot;) addendum.
			<lb />
			This review was sought as FDP-2005 did not envisage gas-sell as the field
			<lb />
			was developed for captive consumption.
			<lb />
			16.1 It was petitioner no.1&quot;s stand that data collected from ongoing
			<lb />
			extended well test had established potential of production of gas from
			<lb />
			Raageshwari Deep Gas Fields (in short &quot;RDG fields&quot;).
			<lb />
			17. Petitioner no.1 in this behalf sought approval of the Management
			<lb />
			Committee (&apos;MC&apos;). Pertinently MC comprises of four (4) members, out of
			<lb />
			which two (2) members represent respondent no.1 and 2. Crucially,
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			members representing respondent no. 1 and 2 are also conferred with Veto
			<lb />
			rights.
			<lb />
			17.1 Despite this configuration, on 23.12.2014, MC approved revised
			<lb />
			FDP which enabled commercial sale of natural gas on the premise that it
			<lb />
			would continue beyond the current tenure of PSC and was likely to go
			<lb />
			upto, at least, 2030.
			<lb />
			18. The record shows that in the interregnum i.e. on 20.05.2013,
			<lb />
			respondent no.2, apparently, had written to petitioner no.1 to give its
			<lb />
			suggestions qua the draft policy formulated by it for grant of extension to
			<lb />
			PSCs awarded to private joint ventures, in cases where the economic life of
			<lb />
			the field was not yet over.
			<lb />
			18.1 Consequently, petitioner no.1 vide communication dated 15.05.2013
			<lb />
			gave its suggestion qua the draft policy for grant of extension to subsisting
			<lb />
			PSCs.
			<lb />
			18.2 Thereafter, several communications were sent in that behalf to all
			<lb />
			and sundry which, however, did not result in any fruitful result. Reliance
			<lb />
			in this regard is placed by the petitioners on communications dated
			<lb />
			16.05.2013, 23.10.2013, 03.12.2013 and 09.01.2014 and 04.02.2014.
			<lb />
			19. Finally, vide communication dated 31.03.2014 respondent no.1
			<lb />
			wrote to respondent no.2. By virtue of this communication, it was
			<lb />
			indicated that respondent no. 2&apos;s proposal for extension of PSCs had been
			<lb />
			examined and, thereafter, a decision had been reached that consent of
			<lb />
			respondent No.3&quot;s Board had to be taken before the proposal could be
			<lb />
			processed further. This view was taken in the background of the fact that
			<lb />

		<body>
			respondent No.3 was one of the parties to contract, and also, GOI&quot;s
			<lb />
			nominee and licensee of the Rajasthan Block. A copy of this letter was
			<lb />
			marked by respondent no.1 to petitioner no.1.
			<lb />
			20. Consequent, thereto vide letter dated 01.04.2014, respondent no.2,
			<lb />
			formally wrote to petitioner no.1 that it had to obtain the consent of the
			<lb />
			respondent No.3&quot;s Board before the proposal for extension of the PSC
			<lb />
			tenure could be re-submitted to respondent no.1/GOI.
			<lb />
			21. Resultantly, petitioner no.1 wrote to respondent No.3 vide letter
			<lb />
			dated 07.04.2014 to accord its consent to the extension of tenure of the
			<lb />
			PSC.
			<lb />
			22. In the same vein, respondent no.2, on 04.06.2014, wrote to
			<lb />
			respondent No.3 to give its comments on petitioner no.1&apos;s proposal for
			<lb />
			seeking extension of the PSC tenure.
			<lb />
			23. While, petitioner No.1 was awaiting a response from respondent
			<lb />
			No.3 with regard to its view on extension of PSC tenure, it wrote another
			<lb />
			letter dated 11.06.2014 to respondent No.2. In this communication, while
			<lb />
			reiterating its view that the PSC, tenure ought to be extended, reference
			<lb />
			was made to clause 4.5 of the Joint Operating Agreement.
			<lb />
			23.1 Based on the said provision, it was contended that being the operator
			<lb />
			of the Rajasthan Block, it was entitled to request for extension of the tenure
			<lb />
			of the PSC. It was the say of petitioner No.1 that under Articles 2.1 and 5.6
			<lb />
			of the PSC, neither the Operating Committee (&apos;OC&apos;) nor the MC had any
			<lb />
			role to play in the matter involving extension of tenure of the PSC. The
			<lb />
			thrust of the communication was that involvement of the MC, at this stage,
			<lb />

		<body>
			would not only delay the matter but would also cause significant loss to the
			<lb />
			exchequer.
			<lb />
			23.2 Importantly, in this communication, emphasis was laid by petitioner
			<lb />
			No.1 on the fact that it was already producing 2 lakh barrels of crude oil
			<lb />
			from Rajasthan block alone which was nearly 1/4 th of the entire domestic
			<lb />
			production. It indicated to respondent No.2 that it had plans to explore,
			<lb />
			develop and produce higher volumes in future -a circumstance which if
			<lb />
			allowed to occur would help the country as GOI otherwise, was importing
			<lb />
			80% of its crude oil requirement.
			<lb />
			24. Via letter dated 12.06.2014, respondent No.3, in response to
			<lb />
			petitioner No.1&quot;s letter of 04.02.2014 not only sought a break-up of
			<lb />
			projected figures of production and planned investments in Rajasthan block
			<lb />
			but also a response to its proposal for extension of tenure.
			<lb />
			24.1 Petitioner No.1, vide written letter dated 20.06.2014, promptly
			<lb />
			supplied the information sought by respondent No.3.
			<lb />
			25. On 14.08.2014, petitioner No.1 apprised GOI that it had submitted
			<lb />
			RDG FDP addendum, wherein, a proposal was made for commercial
			<lb />
			production of gas beyond 2030 at the plateau rate of 0.9 mmscfd. The
			<lb />
			emphasis on behalf of petitioner No.1 was that since Article 2.1 of the PSC
			<lb />
			places an obligation on it to maximize the production of gas, it was
			<lb />
			agreeable to extend the same, in accordance with the provisions of the said
			<lb />
			Article.
			<lb />
			26. In line with the aforesaid, on 15.09.2014, a resolution was passed by
			<lb />
			the OC approving the revised RDG FDP. This recommendation under the

			PSC was made to the MC for its consideration and approval of the Revised
			<lb />
			Development Plan for &quot;RDG&quot; Field and commercial sale of gas. This
			<lb />
			resolution bears the signatures of representatives of petitioner No.1 and
			<lb />
			respondent No.3.
			<lb />
			26.1 In the interregnum i.e. on 03.12.2013, petitioner No.1&quot;s parent
			<lb />
			company wrote to GOI seeking extension of the PSC tenure. Emphasis
			<lb />
			was laid on the fact that extension of PSC should be automatic and the fact
			<lb />
			that they had still not got approval qua the Rajasthan Block. It was also
			<lb />
			stressed that the GOI had earned revenue of Rs.24,000 crores from
			<lb />
			petitioner No.1 during the subsistence of the PSC.
			<lb />
			26.2 Interestingly the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) also got into
			<lb />
			the fray and, accordingly, wrote to the GOI vide letter dated 18.12.2014,
			<lb />
			albeit, in support of all explorers that Global petroleum industry practice
			<lb />
			for PSC extension should be used as a reference point to frame guidelines,
			<lb />
			if the same were required to be formulated. CII emphasized that while
			<lb />
			according extension, fiscal terms should remain unchanged and, in case the
			<lb />
			fiscal terms are being re-negotiated, they should be made more favourable
			<lb />
			to the contractors as it is important to ensure continuity of operations.
			<lb />
			27. Pursuant to the resolution passed by the OC. (to which reference has
			<lb />
			been made above), MC at its meeting held on 23.12.2014 approved the
			<lb />
			revised Raageshwari Deep Gas FDP excluding export gas pipeline. The
			<lb />
			result was that the MC approved production profile of revised Raageshwari
			<lb />
			Deep Gas FDP till 31.12.2030.

			28. In line with the resolution passed by the MC, respondent No.3 vide
			<lb />
			its communication dated 27.01.2015 wrote to respondent No.2 that it had
			<lb />
			approved the revised FDP of RDG Field at its Board of Directors meeting
			<lb />
			held on 21.01.2015, entailing gas delivery at RGT Battery limit with an
			<lb />
			estimated Capex of USD 531.20 million.
			<lb />
			29. In sync with its earlier correspondence, on 19.02.2015, petitioner
			<lb />
			No.1 via one of the MC members wrote to respondent No.2 as to why,
			<lb />
			according to it, both, based on interpretation of Article 2.1 of the PSC and
			<lb />
			economic rationale, the tenure of the PSC should be extended. In support
			<lb />
			of its argument for extension of tenure, reference was made to the fact that
			<lb />
			the MC had approved the revised FDP qua RDG Field having regard to the
			<lb />
			fact that it had been established that commercial gas development could
			<lb />
			take place at least till 2030.
			<lb />
			30. Coincidently, vide a letter of even date i.e. 19.02.2015, respondent
			<lb />
			No.3 wrote to respondent No.2 that they would like to hold a meeting to
			<lb />
			discuss the terms and conditions for extension of tenure of the PSC. In this
			<lb />
			regard, reference was made to the decision taken by respondent No.3&quot;s
			<lb />
			Board of Directors on the subject, which, evidently was conveyed to GOI
			<lb />
			via its letter dated 27.01.2015; a copy of which was dispatched to
			<lb />
			respondent No.2.
			<lb />
			30.1 Respondent No.2, via communication dated 20.02.2015, convened a
			<lb />
			meeting on the issue on 23.02.2015. This communication was addressed
			<lb />
			both to petitioner No.1 as well respondent No.3.

			31. Accordingly, a meeting was convened and at the meeting, after the
			<lb />
			views of representatives of petitioner No.1, respondent No.2 and
			<lb />
			respondent No.3 were heard, a decision was taken that respondent No.3 and
			<lb />
			petitioner No.1 would form a joint working group which would come up
			<lb />
			with a common proposal for extension of tenure of the PSC.
			<lb />
			31.1 Resultantly, it was agreed that they would place their proposal with
			<lb />
			respondent No.2 by 20.03.2015.
			<lb />
			31.2 Significantly on 25.05.2015, respondent No.3 conveyed to GOI that
			<lb />
			its Board of Directors at its meeting dated 28.04.2015 had taken a decision
			<lb />
			that the tenure of the PSC should be extended on the existing terms and
			<lb />
			conditions. Pertinently, in this letter respondent No.3 provided both
			<lb />
			commercial and the legal rational which had propelled its Board of
			<lb />
			Directors to reach such a conclusion.
			<lb />
			32. It appears that pursuant to the issuance of the aforementioned letter
			<lb />
			of respondent No.3 to GOI, a meeting was convened on 18.06.2015,
			<lb />
			amongst, the representatives of petitioner No.1, respondent No.2 and
			<lb />
			respondent No.3 whereat the issue concerning extension of tenure was
			<lb />
			discussed once again. Respondent No.2 conveyed to the other participants
			<lb />
			that GOI would expect an increase in the profit petroleum by at least 5%
			<lb />
			subject to the condition that its share would be protected at the level of at
			<lb />
			least 60% during the extended period of the PSC. Furthermore, respondent
			<lb />
			No.2 conveyed to the other participants that uptil 31.03.2015, the profit
			<lb />
			share of three constituents was as under:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			GOI
			<lb />
			:
			<lb />
			USD 3.2 billion
			<lb />

			(ii) Petitioner No.1
			<lb />
			:
			<lb />
			USD 6.3 billion
			<lb />
			(iii) Respondent No.3/ONGC :
			<lb />
			USD 2.7 billion
			<lb />
			32.1 Importantly both petitioner No.1 and respondent No.3 conveyed to
			<lb />
			respondent No.2 that existing fiscal terms and Contract Area to be extended
			<lb />
			were not negotiable as per the prevailing terms of the contract obtaining
			<lb />
			between the parties. It was pointed out that the extension of the PSC was
			<lb />
			sought in terms thereof and not for the areas within the contract.
			<lb />
			32.3 Evidently, at this meeting, a query was raised by respondent No.2 as
			<lb />
			to why respondent No.3 had changed its view in the matter. The response
			<lb />
			given and as recorded in the drafts minutes of meeting being relevant, is
			<lb />
			extracted hereafter:
			<lb />
			&quot;………ONGC representative responded that the latest ONGC
			<lb />
			Board decision is based on the legal opinion obtained
			<lb />
			subsequently from outside agency. Further, the working
			<lb />
			ground of Cairn and ONGC has also deliberated the present
			<lb />
			development activities in the block, production profile available
			<lb />
			beyond PSC period (both for oil and gas) and the future
			<lb />
			ensuing projects as put up by Operator. All these details were
			<lb />
			also put up to Board, which were deliberated and was primarily
			<lb />
			the basis to review the earlier decision as these activities were
			<lb />
			likely to come/give results beyond the PSC period. Further,
			<lb />
			extension under the existing terms and conditions would be
			<lb />
			beneficial to ONGC as a commercial organization…..&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis is mine)
			<lb />
			33. It appears that petitioner No.1 after having received the drafts
			<lb />
			minutes of meeting dated 18.06.2015, closely examined the profit share
			<lb />
			figures placed at the meeting by respondent No.2.

			33.1 Accordingly, petitioner No.1 sent a mail dated 03.07.2015 to
			<lb />
			respondent No.2 with a copy to respondent No.3 with regard to the profit
			<lb />
			share of each of the constituents.
			<lb />
			33.2 As per this mail, up to 31.03.2015, GOI&quot;s total profit share was USD
			<lb />
			6.1 billion which included profit petroleum and cess (includes NCCD) and
			<lb />
			not USD 3.2 billion as was stated in the draft minutes. In addition thereto,
			<lb />
			it was also pointed out that the Government of Rajasthan had also earned
			<lb />
			money and that its total profit share uptil 31.03.2015 was USD 4.3 billion,
			<lb />
			out of which USD 3.8 billion was earned as royalty and USD 0.5 billion
			<lb />
			was earned in the form of sales tax. Likewise, it was pointed out that while
			<lb />
			respondent No.3&quot;s profit share was rightly recorded as USD 2.7 billion,
			<lb />
			petitioner No1&quot;s profit share was incorrectly recorded. According to
			<lb />
			petitioner No.1, it had earned a total profit of USD 5.1 billion uptil
			<lb />
			31.03.2015 and not USD 6.3 billion as indicated in the draft minutes. The
			<lb />
			relevance of this mail is that an attempt was made by petitioner No.1 to
			<lb />
			show that the Government&quot;s entities had made more money than that which
			<lb />
			was projected at the meeting dated 18.06.2015. In this connection,
			<lb />
			petitioner No.1 sent another mail dated 29.06.2015.
			<lb />
			34. Pursuant to the meeting dated 18.06.2015, respondent No.3 wrote to
			<lb />
			petitioner No.1 via communication dated 22.07.2015 asking it to submit its
			<lb />
			proposed plan of action, reserve estimates, probable project economy and,
			<lb />
			likely, GOI share -so as to justify that the entire area should be retained
			<lb />
			during the extended period of PSC. The said information was sought by
			<lb />
			respondent No.3, from petitioner No.1, by 27.07.2015.

			34.1 On 22.07.2015, respondent No.2 wrote to the petitioner. In this
			<lb />
			letter, petitioner No.1 was informed that GOI was formulating a policy for
			<lb />
			extension of PSC. Comments of petitioner No. 1 were sought vis-à-vis the
			<lb />
			draft policy which was appended to the said letter.
			<lb />
			35. Petitioner No. 1, thus, vide communication dated 25.07.2015 gave its
			<lb />
			comments on the proposed policy sought to be formulated by the GOI for
			<lb />
			extension of Pre-NELP PSCs.
			<lb />
			35.1 In addition thereto, apropos to the letter of respondent No.3 dated
			<lb />
			22.07.2015, petitioner No. 1 vide letter dated 03.08.2015 supplied the
			<lb />
			necessary details.
			<lb />
			35.2 Evidently, respondent No.3 vide letter dated 05.08.2015 sought
			<lb />
			further details from petitioner No.1.
			<lb />
			35.3 Given the fact that further information was sought by respondent
			<lb />
			No.3, petitioner No.1 communicated to respondent no.3 that its help was
			<lb />
			required in expediting the technical evaluation process. Furthermore, it
			<lb />
			was conveyed that since the Rajasthan Block resource estimates for many
			<lb />
			of the fields are only indicative, based on the current understanding, they
			<lb />
			are in no way binding on the parties. It was also suggested by petitioner
			<lb />
			No. 1 that neither approval of OC or MC was required for the said exercise
			<lb />
			and that a high level technical understanding and alignment was sufficient
			<lb />
			to proceed jointly in the matter.
			<lb />
			36. On 18.09.2015, petitioner No. 1 once again wrote to the GOI for an
			<lb />
			early decision on the extension of PSC so that its joint venture partners
			<lb />
			could commit to the additional investments to be made and there could be

			an increase in production, leading to maximization of economic recovery
			<lb />
			from the Rajasthan Block. To buttress its position, further facts and figures
			<lb />
			were also given with regard to production of hydrocarbons from Rajasthan
			<lb />
			Block. It was indicated that 300 million barrels of hydrocarbons were
			<lb />
			produced which not only helped in reducing the country&apos;s dependence on
			<lb />
			energy imports but also saved nearly, a sum of USD 25 billion in foreign
			<lb />
			exchange for the country. Reference was also made to the fact that there
			<lb />
			was a possibility of recovering nearly 1.2 billion BOEs from the Rajasthan
			<lb />
			Block.
			<lb />
			37. The record shows that via communication dated 16.10.2015,
			<lb />
			respondent No.3 called upon petitioner No. 1 to convey to respondent
			<lb />
			No.2, the recoverable potential of the Rajasthan Block beyond the PSC
			<lb />
			period, that is, till 2030 based on technical alignment between JV partners.
			<lb />
			37.1 Consequently, vide letter dated 20.10.2015, petitioner no.1
			<lb />
			communicated to respondent No.2 that the JV partners had deliberated on
			<lb />
			the matter with regard to the remaining recoverable reserve potential of the
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block in the extended tenure period, that is, between 2020 and
			<lb />
			2030.
			<lb />
			37.2 It was, thus, conveyed by petitioner no.1 that JV partners were fully
			<lb />
			aligned on the overall primary recoverable reserve potential of the
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block. Petitioner No.1 stressed the point that the technical
			<lb />
			alignment achieved, demonstrated that the Rajasthan Block was estimated
			<lb />
			to hold a total recoverable resource potential of 1.128 BOEs. The break-up
			<lb />
			of this figure was also provided in the letter which reads as follows:

			&quot;……0.280 bn boe has been produced till March 2015
			<lb />
			0.382 bn boe incremental potential between FY15-16 to

			FY19-20
			<lb />
			0.466 bn boe incremental potential between FY19-20 to
			<lb />
			FY29-30…&quot;
			<lb />
			38. What is important to note is that petitioner No. 1 indicated to
			<lb />
			respondent No.2 that the aforementioned communication should be treated
			<lb />
			as its final communication, marking fulfillment of requirements qua the
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block with respect to achieving technical alignment.
			<lb />
			38.1 A great amount of stress was laid by petitioner No.1 on fact that it
			<lb />
			was critical, that an early decision be taken on extension of the tenure of
			<lb />
			the PSC to avoid potential value loss.
			<lb />
			39. As had been the approach in the past, respondent No.2 vide letter
			<lb />
			dated 30.10.2015, asked for further information from petitioner no.1.
			<lb />
			40. Consequently vide letter dated 05.11.2015, petitioner no.1 gave its
			<lb />
			justification for retaining the areas referred to in the PSC for its extension.
			<lb />
			Since endorsement of JV partners was also required to be given, petitioner
			<lb />
			No. 1 vide letter dated 06.11.2015 wrote to respondent No.3 requesting for
			<lb />
			a joint endorsement of commercials, as was sought by respondent No.2. In
			<lb />
			this regard, a request was made that a meeting be convened.
			<lb />
			41. Since, there was no movement in the matter, the petitioners took the
			<lb />
			decision to move this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the captioned writ petition was filed which, as indicated
			<lb />
			above, came up before this Court for the first time on 14.12.2015. The
			<lb />
			Court after recording submissions of the counsel for parties decided to

			issue certain directions, albeit, without prejudice to rights and contentions
			<lb />
			of parties. A perusal of the order would show that the Court was concerned
			<lb />
			about the delay in decision being taken with regard to the extension of
			<lb />
			PSC. Consequently, the Court, as indicated above, fixed a time frame for
			<lb />
			each step. These directions are recorded in paragraphs 17 of the order.
			<lb />
			The relevant part of the said order is extracted hereafter:-
			<lb />
			&quot;A
			<lb />
			The respondents no. 1 &amp; 2 Ministry of Petroleum &amp;
			<lb />
			Natural Gas and Director General of Hydrocarbons to within
			<lb />
			four weeks furnish the petitioners, with a copy to the respondent
			<lb />
			No.3 ONGC, a list of further particulars if any required by
			<lb />
			them to be able to take a decision on the request of the
			<lb />
			petitioners for extension of PSS.
			<lb />
			B
			<lb />
			The respondent No.3 ONGC to also within the said
			<lb />
			period of four weeks furnish the petitioners a list of further
			<lb />
			particulars required by the respondent No.3 ONGC to give its
			<lb />
			consent to the commercial terms of the project of the petitioner
			<lb />
			for extension.
			<lb />
			C
			<lb />
			The petitioners to within two weeks thereafter furnish to
			<lb />
			the respondent No.3 ONGC the particulars sought by the
			<lb />
			respondent No.3 ONGC.
			<lb />
			D
			<lb />
			The respondent No.3 ONGC to take a decision thereon
			<lb />
			within a period of six weeks and to communicate the same to
			<lb />
			the petitioners.
			<lb />
			E
			<lb />
			If there consensus between the petitioners and the
			<lb />
			respondent No.3/ONGC, the petitioners will forward the
			<lb />
			documents in that regard to the GoI.
			<lb />
			F.
			<lb />
			The GoI to take a decision thereon within three months
			<lb />
			therefrom.&quot;
			<lb />
			42. The matter was, thereafter, posted for hearing on 05.04.2016. On
			<lb />
			that date, it was represented on behalf of respondent No.1/GOI that due to

		<body>
			insufficient information being supplied by the petitioners, respondent No.3
			<lb />
			could not take a decision on the petitioners&apos; request for extension of tenure
			<lb />
			of PSC beyond 2020. Accordingly, the Court directed respondent No.3 to
			<lb />
			give last and final opportunity to the petitioners to furnish the relevant
			<lb />
			documents. For this purpose, two weeks were granted to the petitioners.
			<lb />
			Respondent No.3 was directed to take a decision within a period of two
			<lb />
			weeks of the documents being furnished. The matter was renotified for
			<lb />
			28.07.2016
			<lb />
			43. In the interregnum, an interlocutory application (C.M.
			<lb />
			No.17679/2016) was moved and the matter was taken up on 11.05.2016.
			<lb />
			On that date, respondent No.3 was directed to convey to the petitioners
			<lb />
			within one week as to the additional information sought by it.
			<lb />
			Furthermore, on behalf of respondent No.3, an assurance was given to the
			<lb />
			Court that once additional information was supplied by the petitioners, a
			<lb />
			decision would be taken within a period of five (5) weeks.
			<lb />
			44. The matter, thereafter, came up for hearing, thereupon, on the usual
			<lb />
			date i.e. 28.07.2016. On this date, the Court recorded that respondent No.3
			<lb />
			had taken a decision to approve the request of the petitioners and that this
			<lb />
			decision was being forwarded to the GOI for its consideration and final
			<lb />
			approval. On behalf of the GOI, it was conveyed to the Court that a
			<lb />
			decision will be taken on the issue within the next five weeks. The matter
			<lb />
			was fixed for further proceedings on 09.09.2016. On 09.09.2016, on behalf
			<lb />
			of the GOI, a stand was taken that in terms of the Court&apos;s earlier order dated
			<lb />
			14.12.2015, it had available to it a period of three months from the date
			<lb />
			respondent No.3 forwarded its decision to it for processing the same. Thus,

		<body>
			the plea made on behalf of the GOI was that GOI will convey its decision
			<lb />
			to the Court by 14.10.2016.
			<lb />
			44.1 Accordingly, the matter was posted for further consideration by the
			<lb />
			Court on 07.11.2016. On 07.11.2016, an interlocutory application was
			<lb />
			placed before the Court i.e. C.M. No.41397/2016. It was argued on behalf
			<lb />
			of GOI that it would require time to evaluate the pros and cons as also the
			<lb />
			technical and financial impact of extension of PSC sought by the
			<lb />
			contractors. It was sought to be conveyed to the Court that Policy
			<lb />
			guidelines had to be formulated so that a uniform decision could be taken
			<lb />
			in such like matters including the matter under consideration. Time for the
			<lb />
			purpose was sought till 31.01.2017.
			<lb />
			44.2 The Court, however, declined to link the formulation of policy
			<lb />
			guidelines with the matter at hand. The observations made by the Court in
			<lb />
			this behalf, being crucial, are extracted hereafter:-
			<lb />
			&quot;….. The decision that the respondent no. 1 is to take is in terms
			<lb />
			of the order dated 14.12.2015 passed by this court. That order
			<lb />
			does not link taking of any decision with any policy guidelines
			<lb />
			that the respondent may be contemplating to be framing.
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 has to take decision in terms of the order
			<lb />
			dated 14.12.2015 without linking the same with any policy
			<lb />
			guidelines that may be in contemplation. Taking of a decision
			<lb />
			cannot be delayed or postponed on that account.
			<lb />
			Since the respondent requires some consultative process
			<lb />
			to be carried out, I deem it appropriate to grant further time of
			<lb />
			two months i.e. till 06.01.2017 to comply with the order dated
			<lb />
			14.12.2015. It may be noted that respondents have twice earlier
			<lb />
			assured the court that decision would be taken within the
			<lb />
			timeline as per order dated 14.12.2015. It is expected that
			<lb />
			respondents shall now positively take a decision within the time

			granted by this court. The application is disposed of, in the
			<lb />
			above terms… &quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis is mine)
			<lb />
			45. Record shows that an interlocutory application (C.M.No.649/2017)
			<lb />
			was filed by GOI to seek extension of time for complying with the
			<lb />
			directions contained in the order dated 07.11.2016. The Court, based on
			<lb />
			the stand taken by the learned ASG on behalf of the GOI that he had
			<lb />
			personally examined the matter and that earnest steps had been taken to
			<lb />
			reach a decision, extended the time till 28.02.2017.
			<lb />
			45.1 The matter was posted for further proceedings on 31.03.2017.
			<lb />
			45.2 Thereafter, despite three dates, no substantial orders could be passed
			<lb />
			in the matter.
			<lb />
			46. For the purpose of good order and record, it would be relevant to
			<lb />
			note, at this juncture that vide order dated 28.07.2017, based on an
			<lb />
			application (C.M. No. 26719/2017), the amendment to the cause title was
			<lb />
			allowed, whereby, the name of petitioner No. 1 was allowed to be
			<lb />
			substituted for Vedanta Limited, in view of an order of amalgamation
			<lb />
			passed by the Mumbai Bench of National Company Law Tribunal, on
			<lb />
			23.03.2017.
			<lb />
			47. The matter came up before this Court on 17.01.2018.
			<lb />
			48. After hearing the detailed arguments in the matter, judgment was
			<lb />
			reserved.
			<lb />
			49. However, an application (C.M. No.19300/2018) was moved on
			<lb />
			behalf of the petitioners, whereby, they sought leave to apply under the

			New Policy along with respondent No.3, albeit, without prejudice to their
			<lb />
			rights and contentions. Consequently vide order dated 10.05.2018, leave
			<lb />
			was granted to the petitioners to apply under the New policy without
			<lb />
			prejudice to the rights and contentions of the contesting parties.
			<lb />
			49.1 The application was disposed of on 10.05.2018, based on an agreed
			<lb />
			direction.
			<lb />
			50. Given this background, let me briefly set out the arguments
			<lb />
			advanced on behalf of the parties herein:
			<lb />
			Submissions of the counsel
			<lb />
			50.1 However, before I proceed further, it would be relevant to record that
			<lb />
			submission on behalf of the petitioner were advanced by Mr. C.A.
			<lb />
			Sundaram, Senior Advocate, whereas, on behalf of respondent No.1/GOI
			<lb />
			and respondent No.2, submissions were advanced by Mr. Kirtiman Singh.
			<lb />
			Likewise, on behalf of respondent No.3, arguments were made by Mr.Ajay
			<lb />
			Kumar Jha and Mr. Sasiprabhu.
			<lb />
			50.2 It was the submission of the petitioners that the present case only
			<lb />
			requires interpretation of one clause of the PSC i.e. Article 2.1. Therefore,
			<lb />
			according to the petitioners, notwithstanding the objection taken by the
			<lb />
			respondents, a writ petition was maintainable under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, as the issue raised would have impact on production of oil
			<lb />
			and natural gas available in the country. In other words, the petitioners
			<lb />
			contend that the dispute relates to public law. Furthermore, the petitioners
			<lb />
			contend that since, the respondents are not agreeable to the grant extension
			<lb />
			of tenure despite unambiguous provision contained in Article 2.1 of the
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />

		</page>
		<body>
			PSC, actions of the respondents are both unreasonable and arbitrary, and
			<lb />
			therefore, the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution would come into
			<lb />
			play.
			<lb />
			50.3 In this behalf, it was contended that the Rajasthan Block was not a
			<lb />
			discovered field, at the point in time, when, the PSC was executed between
			<lb />
			the parties concerned. Respondent No.1/GOI had, in fact, devised the
			<lb />
			methodology of putting in place a PSC so as to attract private investments
			<lb />
			for exploration and development of Rajasthan Block. Accordingly, the
			<lb />
			PSC gave incentives for exploration and development of the Rajasthan
			<lb />
			Block and, in consonance with said theme, stipulated therein that if there
			<lb />
			was commercial production of natural gas, which was expected to continue
			<lb />
			beyond the initial existing term of the PSC i.e. 2020, then, automatic
			<lb />
			extension for a further period of 10 years, albeit, on the same terms and
			<lb />
			conditions would be given.
			<lb />
			50.4 This, according to the petitioners, being in line with the good
			<lb />
			petroleum industry practice would enable maximization of production of
			<lb />
			natural gas.
			<lb />
			50.5 The failure on the part of respondent No.1/GOI to confirm extension
			<lb />
			of tenure of the PSC, based on the existing terms and conditions, was
			<lb />
			according to the petitioners, not only creating a sense of uncertainty but as
			<lb />
			also adversely affecting their future investment programs. In other words,
			<lb />
			the lack of clarity on the issue was discouraging financers from lending
			<lb />
			monies required for investment in the Rajasthan Block. This uncertainty,
			<lb />
			according to the petitioners, was adversely and irrevocably affecting the
			<lb />
			viability and recoverability of crude oil from the Rajasthan Block.

			50.6 It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that respondent
			<lb />
			No.1/GOI would get 80%of the revenue over the life of the Rajasthan
			<lb />
			Block and, therefore, increase in the revenue was in public interest.
			<lb />
			Emphasis was laid on behalf of the petitioners on the fact that till
			<lb />
			September, 2017, the petitioners had paid over US$ 13.7 billion to
			<lb />
			respondent No.1/GOI in the form of profit petroleum, royalty, cess and
			<lb />
			sales tax. Furthermore, it was also contended that so far as the petitioners
			<lb />
			were concerned, it had already invested a sum of Rs.46,000 crores towards
			<lb />
			exploration, development and production, which was expected to increase
			<lb />
			to approximately Rs.54,000 crores by the end of financial year 2020.
			<lb />
			50.7 Importantly, it was sought to be brought to the notice of the Court
			<lb />
			that Article 2.1 which stands incorporated in the instant PSC dated
			<lb />
			15.05.1995, was customized and was, therefore, distinctly different from
			<lb />
			the Model Pre-NELP PSCs. For the sake of convenience, two articles are
			<lb />
			extracted hereafter:-
			<lb />
			Article 2.1 of the Model Pre-
			<lb />
			NELP PSC
			<lb />
			Article 2.1 of PSC dated 15.05.1995
			<lb />
			The terms of this Contract,
			<lb />
			subject to the terms hereof and
			<lb />
			the applicable laws, shall be for
			<lb />
			a period of twenty five (25) years
			<lb />
			from the Effective Date, unless
			<lb />
			the Contract is terminated
			<lb />
			earlier in accordance with its
			<lb />
			terms, but may be extended upon
			<lb />
			mutual agreement between the
			<lb />
			Parties for a further Period not
			<lb />
			exceeding five (5) years.
			<lb />
			The term of this Contract subject to the
			<lb />
			terms hereof and the applicable laws,
			<lb />
			shall be for a period of twenty five (25)
			<lb />
			years from the Effective Date, unless
			<lb />
			the Contract is terminated earlier in
			<lb />
			accordance with its terms, but may be
			<lb />
			extended upon mutual agreement
			<lb />
			between the Parties for a further Period
			<lb />
			not exceeding five (5) years.
			<lb />
			Provided that in the event of Provided that in the event of

		<body>
			Commercial Production of Non
			<lb />
			Associated Natural Gas, the
			<lb />
			Contract may, by mutual
			<lb />
			agreement between the parties,
			<lb />
			be extended for a period not
			<lb />
			exceeding ten (10) years.
			<lb />
			Commercial Production of Natural
			<lb />
			Gas, which is expected to continue
			<lb />
			beyond the end of the terms of the
			<lb />
			Contract, the Contract shall be
			<lb />
			extended for such a period up to but
			<lb />
			not exceeding thirty five (35) years
			<lb />
			from the Effective Date, as may be
			<lb />
			mutually agreed between the Parties to
			<lb />
			be sufficient to permit the Contractor
			<lb />
			to maximize the production of Natural
			<lb />
			Gas in accordance with
			<lb />
			good
			<lb />
			petroleum industry practice.
			<lb />
			If the production of Crude Oil or of
			<lb />
			Natural Gas is expected to continue
			<lb />
			beyond the end of the relevant period
			<lb />
			referred to above, the Parties may
			<lb />
			agree to extend this Contract for a
			<lb />
			further period upon such terms as may
			<lb />
			be mutually agreed.
			<lb />
			(emphasis is mine)
			<lb />
			50.8 Based on the difference in the language of Article 2.1 as found in the
			<lb />
			instant PSC, and that which is found mentioned in the Model pre-NELP
			<lb />
			PSC, it was argued that respondent No.1/GOI was obligated to
			<lb />
			automatically extend the tenure by another 10 years, albeit, on the existing
			<lb />
			terms and conditions. In this context, it was emphasized that the purpose
			<lb />
			of automatic extension was to enable the contractors to maximize the
			<lb />
			production of natural gas in accordance with good petroleum industry
			<lb />
			practice.
			<lb />
			51. Accordingly, my attention was drawn to the fact that there was no
			<lb />
			dispute that commercial production of natural gas from Rajasthan Block
			<lb />
			was expected to continue beyond 2020 for a period of 10 years i.e. up to
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />
		</note>

			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			14.05.2030. In this context, reference was made to the approval granted by
			<lb />
			the MC to the revised FDP qua the Rajasthan Block, on the basis, that
			<lb />
			commercial production of natural gas from the said block was expected to
			<lb />
			continue even beyond 2030.
			<lb />
			51.1 It was stated that it was for this reason that respondent No.3, on
			<lb />
			08.07.2016 during the pendency of the instant writ petition, had approved
			<lb />
			the extension of PSC for a period of 10 years beyond the existing tenure,
			<lb />
			albeit, on the same terms and conditions.
			<lb />
			51.2 This decision, according to the petitioners, had the approval of the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors of respondent No.3, which was taken at their meeting
			<lb />
			held on 30.06.2016.
			<lb />
			51.3 In other words, it is contended that proviso to Article 2.1 adverts to
			<lb />
			petitioner No.1&quot;s accrued right of extension which, willy-nilly, stands
			<lb />
			vested in it. This right, according to the petitioners, is recognized in the
			<lb />
			PSC as other rights under Article 7.1.
			<lb />
			51.4 According to the petitioners, the New Policy was not applicable to
			<lb />
			them as it was announced by respondent No.1/GOI during the pendency of
			<lb />
			the instant writ petition. As per the directions issued by this Court on
			<lb />
			07.11.2016, respondent No.1/GOI was required to take a decision on the
			<lb />
			issue of extension of tenure of the PSC under Article 2.1 to the New Policy
			<lb />
			without linking it to policy guidelines. According to the petitioners, this
			<lb />
			was contrary to the directions issued by this Court on 07.11.2016 and,
			<lb />
			therefore, the communication dated 12.04.2017 served on the petitioners
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />
		</note>
		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			calling upon them to apply under the New Policy was an attempt to
			<lb />
			overreach the directions issued by this Court.
			<lb />
			51.5 It was, thus, contended on behalf of the petitioners, that the
			<lb />
			provisions in the New Policy which require them to pay an additional sum
			<lb />
			of 10% had no nexus with the objective of improving the investment
			<lb />
			climate so as to ensure expeditious exploration of resources and
			<lb />
			maximization of production in the interest of energy security of the
			<lb />
			country.
			<lb />
			51.6 It is submitted that the action of respondent No.1/GOI in unilaterally
			<lb />
			applying the provisions of PSC by taking recourse to the New Policy was
			<lb />
			not tenable in law. For this purpose, reliance was placed, on behalf of the
			<lb />
			petitioners on Article 34.2 of the PSC, which, according to them,
			<lb />
			prohibited amendments, modifications, variations or even having the PSC
			<lb />
			supplemented in any respect without the parties agreeing to it.
			<lb />
			51.7 Therefore, the submission advanced was that respondent No.1/GOI
			<lb />
			could not abuse its position as a sovereign and unilaterally amend the terms
			<lb />
			of the contract.
			<lb />
			51.8 In support of its principal argument that extension of tenure of the
			<lb />
			PSC had to occur on the subsisting terms and conditions, it was argued that
			<lb />
			such an approach, if adopted, would impart business efficacy to the PSC. It
			<lb />
			was contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that based on the PSC, they
			<lb />
			had irreversibly altered their position and, therefore, the respondents could
			<lb />
			not change their position at this juncture as it would adversely affect their
			<lb />

			<lb />

		<body>
			interest. In this behalf, petitioners sought to rely upon the doctrine of
			<lb />
			promissory estoppels and legitimate expectation.
			<lb />
			51.9 Furthermore, it was contended that certainty was the bulwark of such
			<lb />
			like contracts, and, therefore, the State like any other prudent businessmen
			<lb />
			should adhere to its commitment and honour its obligations. Reference was
			<lb />
			also made to the fact that respondent No.1/GOI was committed to creating
			<lb />
			an atmosphere of &quot;ease of doing business&quot; in the country and, thus,
			<lb />
			consistent with that principle, it should extend the tenure of the contract as
			<lb />
			it was in sync with the principles of good governance, stability and
			<lb />
			consistency.
			<lb />
			51.10 The petitioners also adverted to the fact that Article 2.1 of the PSC
			<lb />
			could not be linked to the area under the commercial production qua
			<lb />
			natural gas. It was stated that the extension was mandatory, if commercial
			<lb />
			production of natural gas was expected to continue beyond the term of the
			<lb />
			PSC-which, according to the petitioners, was the relevant consideration
			<lb />
			rather than the surface/on-ground area. For this purpose, reliance was
			<lb />
			placed on the affidavit dated 19.09.2017 filed on behalf of respondent
			<lb />
			No.1/GOI, wherein, while recognizing the fact that commercial production
			<lb />
			of natural gas had occurred, it was stated that it was confined to a smaller
			<lb />
			area.
			<lb />
			52. Furthermore, the petitioners contend that revenue maximization
			<lb />
			cannot be the sole or overriding objective of respondent No.1/GOI. For
			<lb />
			this purpose, reference was made to the judgment of the Constitution
			<lb />
			Bench of the Supreme Court in Special Reference No.1/2012 (2012) 10
			<lb />

			SCC 1. This apart, in support of their other submissions, the petitioners
			<lb />
			relied upon the following judgments: -
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			A. Ayyasamy Vs. A Paramashivam and Ors., (2016) 10 SCC 386;
			<lb />
			(ii) Vodafone International Holdings BV Vs. Union of India, (2012)
			<lb />
			341 ITR 1 (SC);
			<lb />
			(iii) The State of Bihar and Anr. Vs. P.E.C. Ltd and Others., (2004) 3
			<lb />
			PLJR 741; and
			<lb />
			(iv) UP Power Corporation Ltd. and Anr. Vs. Sant Steel and Alloys Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd. and Ors. (2009) 13 SCC 55.
			<lb />
			53. On behalf of respondents No. 1 &amp; 2, it was contended that the writ
			<lb />
			petition need not proceed further as respondent No.1/GOI had taken a
			<lb />
			decision in the matter. In other words since a decision had been taken by
			<lb />
			respondent No.1/GOI, which, had been conveyed to the petitioners, nothing
			<lb />
			would survive in the instant writ petition. For this purpose, reliance was
			<lb />
			placed not only on the New policy, but also, on the subsequent
			<lb />
			communication dated 12.04.2017, whereby, the petitioners were called
			<lb />
			upon to apply under the New policy. In support of this submission, as
			<lb />
			indicated above, reliance was placed on behalf of respondents No. 1 &amp; 2 on
			<lb />
			the observations made by the Court at the time of issuing notice via its
			<lb />
			order dated 14.12.2015.
			<lb />
			53.1 Besides this, it was contended that since the dispute fell within the
			<lb />
			realm of a contract, this Court ought not entertain the writ petition. The
			<lb />
			emphasis was, on the fact that since the dispute raised was in the realm of
			<lb />
			contract remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution was not warranted.

		<body>
			Furthermore, it was submitted that Article 2.1 of the PSC clearly indicated
			<lb />
			that the tenure of the contract was only up to 14.05.2020 and that beyond
			<lb />
			this period, extension can be granted based only on &apos;mutual agreement&apos;
			<lb />
			arrived at between the parties.
			<lb />
			53.2 In this context, it was stated the fact that a New Policy had been
			<lb />
			approved and a framework had been provided for grant of extension qua all
			<lb />
			Pre-NELP PSCs, the extension could take place based only on what was
			<lb />
			provided in the said policy.
			<lb />
			53.3 It was, thus, emphasized that as communicated by respondent
			<lb />
			No.1/GOI in its letter dated 12.04.2017, the contractors would have to
			<lb />
			submit a formal application for seeking approval of extension of tenure of
			<lb />
			the PSC. In support of submissions made on behalf of respondent No.1 and
			<lb />
			2, reliance was placed on the following judgments: Arun Kumar Aggarwal
			<lb />
			Vs. Union of India, 2013 (7) SCC 1; and Joshi Technologies
			<lb />
			International Inc. Vs. Union of India &amp; Others, (2015) 7 SCC 728.
			<lb />
			54. On behalf of respondent No.3, it was argued that since the New
			<lb />
			policy had come into play, the reliance placed by the petitioners on Article
			<lb />
			2.1 of the PSC was meaningless as the extension was to be granted on
			<lb />
			mutually agreed terms. It was submitted that in the absence of the Policy
			<lb />
			for extension of pre-NELP exploratory block PSC, respondent No.3 had
			<lb />
			agreed for extension on the subsisting terms and conditions, which was
			<lb />
			conveyed vide communication dated 08.07.2016.
			<lb />
			54.1 According to respondent no.3, this position had undergone a change
			<lb />
			with the New policy coming into force on 07.04.2017. It was stated that

		<body>
			respondent No.3 being a nominee of respondent No.1/GOI, it was required
			<lb />
			to abide by the decision of respondent No.1/GOI. In this context, it was
			<lb />
			sought to be highlighted that the New Policy had been issued before the
			<lb />
			expiry of the subsisting terms of the PSC, that is, prior to 14.05.2020 and
			<lb />
			hence it would apply to the PSC in issue.
			<lb />
			54.2 In this context, on behalf of respondent No.3, it was argued that once
			<lb />
			respondent No.1/GOI had formulated its New Policy, its Board of Directors
			<lb />
			held a meeting on 28.12.2017 and took the following decision:
			<lb />
			&quot;……ONGC being a Government nominee in RJ-ON-90/1
			<lb />
			Block to seek extension of PSC term by 10 years as per terms
			<lb />
			and conditions mentioned in GOI Policy for Grant of Extension

			<lb />
			dated

			07.04.2017……..&quot;
			<lb />
			Reasons
			<lb />
			55. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
			<lb />
			record.
			<lb />
			56. What emerges from the record and qua which, there is possibly no
			<lb />
			dispute is as follows:-
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block was not a discovered field at the point in time the
			<lb />
			PSC in issue was signed between the parties.
			<lb />
			(ii) The PSC was executed on 15.05.1995.
			<lb />
			(iii) For the first seven (7) years of the contract (i.e. between 1993 and
			<lb />
			2003), petitioner No. 1&apos;s predecessor-in-interest could not make any

			commercial discovery, even though substantial amounts were invested in
			<lb />
			the Rajasthan Block. This resulted in a change being brought about in the
			<lb />
			participants&apos; interest, to which, I have made a reference above.
			<lb />
			(iv) The subsisting tenure of the PSC, if not extended, would come to an
			<lb />
			end on 14.05.2020.
			<lb />
			(v) On 25.05.2015, respondent No.3 in a letter to respondent No.1/GOI
			<lb />
			conveyed to it that at its Board of Directors&apos; meeting held on 28.04.2015, a
			<lb />
			decision had been taken to seek a extension of tenure of the PSC in issue,
			<lb />
			albeit, on the subsisting terms and conditions.
			<lb />
			(vi) In the interregnum, on 15.09.2014, the OC, concerned with the
			<lb />
			Rajasthan Block had approved the revised FDP for RDG. This was placed
			<lb />
			for approval before the MC, which, at its meeting held on 23.12.2014, also
			<lb />
			approved the revised FDP for RDG.
			<lb />
			(vii) Interestingly, at a meeting convened by respondent No.2, on
			<lb />
			18.06.2015, where representatives of petitioner No. 1 and respondent No.3
			<lb />
			were also present, a query was addressed to the representative of
			<lb />
			respondent No.3, whereby, it was sought to be ascertained as to why it had
			<lb />
			changed its view and agreed to the request of the petitioners to extend the
			<lb />
			tenure of the PSC. Crucially, the representative of respondent No.3, in
			<lb />
			response, gave a cogent answer, which was, that respondent no.3 had not
			<lb />
			only sought a legal opinion from an outside legal expert but had also
			<lb />
			examined the commercials, and thereafter, reached a considered decision
			<lb />
			that the tenure of the PSC had to be extended and that too on subsisting
			<lb />
			terms and conditions.

			57. Clearly, the stand of respondent No.1 that it wanted a higher share of
			<lb />
			petroleum profits got articulated at the joint meeting held on 18.06.2015.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, there was back and forth on the technical and financial
			<lb />
			information sought by respondent No.2 from petitioner No. 1/respondent
			<lb />
			No.3. The details of how correspondence was exchanged on this aspect, has
			<lb />
			been dealt in detail, by me, while narrating the facts of the case. Therefore,
			<lb />
			despite the fact that respondent no.3 had conveyed its decision to
			<lb />
			respondent No.1, not once, but on two occasions, that the tenure of the PSC
			<lb />
			had to be extended on the same terms and conditions, an attempt was made
			<lb />
			to delay the final decision by seeking information with regard to additional
			<lb />
			investments, which would be required to be made for the extended period
			<lb />
			of the PSC and the benefit that would accrue thereof in terms of the
			<lb />
			production of oil and gas.
			<lb />
			58. It was in the background of these facts and circumstances that the
			<lb />
			petitioners approached this Court by way of the instant writ petition. As
			<lb />
			alluded to above, while narrating the factual scenario that it was only upon
			<lb />
			the Court nudging respondent No.1 and respondent No.3 to move in the
			<lb />
			matter that a decision was taken qua extension of tenure of the PSC. While
			<lb />
			the matter was in Court, on 08.07.2016, respondent No.3 conveyed to
			<lb />
			respondent No.1/GOI that its Board of Directors had taken a decision to
			<lb />
			seek extension of the PSC on the subsisting terms and conditions on
			<lb />
			8.7.2016.
			<lb />
			59. It was only, thereafter, that this aspect of the matter got reflected in
			<lb />
			the proceedings of the Court held on 07.11.2016. The relevant parts of the
			<lb />
			said order have been extracted hereinabove by me..

			59.1 A close perusal of order dated 07.11.2016 would show that even
			<lb />
			though respondent No.1/GOI conveyed to the Court that it was in the
			<lb />
			process of framing policy guidelines for extension of the Pre-NELP PSCs,
			<lb />
			the Court made it clear that respondent no.1/ GOI could not link its policy
			<lb />
			guidelines with its decision in the matter as that was not contemplated by
			<lb />
			the order of 14.12.2015. Accordingly, the Court on 07.11.2016 gave time
			<lb />
			till 06.01.2017 to respondent No.1/GOI to comply with the order dated
			<lb />
			14.12.2015.
			<lb />
			59.2 Respondent No.1, concededly, did not chose to challenge, either the
			<lb />
			directions contained in the order dated 14.12.2015 or, those which were
			<lb />
			contained in the order dated 07.11.2016.
			<lb />
			60. Despite the aforesaid situation obtaining, respondent No.1/GOI
			<lb />
			sprung upon the petitioners, the New Policy which was framed on
			<lb />
			07.04.2018 and consequent thereto, told the petitioners via letter dated
			<lb />
			12.04.2017 to apply under the New policy for seeking extension of the
			<lb />
			PSC.
			<lb />
			61. Given this foreground, the issues which, to my mind, arise for
			<lb />
			consideration are as follows:
			<lb />
			Issues
			<lb />
			I.
			<lb />
			Did the order dated 14.12.2015, passed by this Court, foreclose a
			<lb />
			final examination by the Court as to whether a remedy by way of a writ is
			<lb />
			maintainable in the facts and circumstances of this case?
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />
		</note>
		<page>
			Page 37 of 56
			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			II.
			<lb />
			If the answer to issue No. I is in the affirmative, did a remedy by
			<lb />
			way of writ petition lie in the instant case?
			<lb />
			III. If the answers to issues No. I &amp; II are in the affirmative, can the
			<lb />
			petitioners seek extension of the existing tenure of the PSC beyond
			<lb />
			14.05.2020 i.e. till 14.05.2030 unimpeded by the fact that a New Policy has
			<lb />
			come into play?
			<lb />
			IV. What is the scope and effect of Article 2.1, which obtains in the PSC
			<lb />
			in issue?
			<lb />
			V.
			<lb />
			If Article 2.1 entitles the petitioners to extension of tenure of the
			<lb />
			PSC, is the refusal to extend the tenure by the respondents arbitrary and
			<lb />
			unfair?
			<lb />
			Issue No. I
			<lb />
			62. A careful perusal of the order dated 14.12.2015 would show that the
			<lb />
			Court had not foreclosed the issue with regard to whether or not in the
			<lb />
			instant case, a remedy by way of writ would be available to the petitioners.
			<lb />
			The observations made were tentative in nature. The Court, at that
			<lb />
			juncture, was of the view that notwithstanding the objections taken qua the
			<lb />
			maintainability of a writ, the procrastination displayed by the respondents
			<lb />
			qua the issue of extension of tenure of the PSC, necessitated its intercession
			<lb />
			in the matter. The idea was to nudge the respondents to take a call in the
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />
		</note>
		<page>
			Page 38 of 56
			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			matter in terms of its obligation under PSC. At that stage, clearly, the legal
			<lb />
			tenability of a wrong call could not have been tested.
			<lb />
			62.1 Therefore, the argument advanced on behalf of the respondents, in
			<lb />
			particular, respondent No.1/GOI, that since a decision had been taken, the
			<lb />
			writ petition had worked itself out and consequently, rendered infructuous,
			<lb />
			to my mind, is a submission which is completely unsustainable. In any
			<lb />
			event, in my view, the order dated 14.12.2015 was only an interim order
			<lb />
			which could not have precluded further arguments that the petitioners
			<lb />
			would have wanted to advance in the matter. In fact, right from inception,
			<lb />
			the stand of the petitioners has been, (given the construct of Article 2.1 of
			<lb />
			the PSC) that the respondents have no choice but to extend the tenure for
			<lb />
			the PSC for another 10 years, once, the stage of commercial production of
			<lb />
			gas is reached. Further, there are no such observations in the order which
			<lb />
			would prevent examination of the issue, that is, whether or not a writ
			<lb />
			petition would lie in matter of like nature.
			<lb />
			Issue No. II
			<lb />
			63. The answer to this question would be in the affirmative, only if one
			<lb />
			were to come to the conclusion that though the dispute is in the realm of a
			<lb />
			contractual field, the State has acted in a manner which is arbitrary,
			<lb />
			unreasonable and unfair manner.
			<lb />
			63.1 Before I proceed further, I may advert to the decision of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in ABL International Ltd. And Another Vs. Export Credit
			<lb />
			Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd &amp; Others., (2004) 3 SCC 553.
			<lb />
			63.2 The broad facts which obtained in ABL were as follows:

			63.3 A company by the name of Rassik Woodworth Limited (&apos;RWL&apos;)
			<lb />
			entered into a contract with a State-owned Corporation of Kazakhstan for
			<lb />
			supply of for supply of 3,000 metric tons of tea.
			<lb />
			63.4 This agreement was entered into between them in and about
			<lb />
			26.08.1993. As per the terms of the agreement, payment for tea exported
			<lb />
			was to be made by Kazakhstan Corporation by barter of goods mentioned
			<lb />
			in the schedule to the agreement, albeit, within 120 days of the date of
			<lb />
			delivery by the exporter.
			<lb />
			63.5 The agreement was guaranteed by the Government of Kazakhstan.
			<lb />
			Evidently, on the very same day, when, the agreement was signed, clause 6
			<lb />
			of the agreement which provided for payment by barter of goods came to
			<lb />
			be amended by way of an addendum. By virtue of the amendment, it was
			<lb />
			agreed that if the barter of goods could not be finalized for any reason,
			<lb />
			then, the Kazakhstan Corporation was to pay to the exporter for the goods
			<lb />
			received by it in US Dollars within 120 days of delivery.
			<lb />
			63.6 Such payment was required to be remitted by Kazakhstan
			<lb />
			Corporation to the bank account of an exporter at Delhi. The amended
			<lb />
			agreement also received the backing of the Kazakhstan Government.
			<lb />
			63.7 After RWL had entered into the said agreement with Kazakhstan
			<lb />
			Corporation, it assigned a part of the said export contract to ABL, albeit, on
			<lb />
			the same terms and conditions.
			<lb />
			63.8 Upon a direction issued by the Reserve Bank of India, the appellants
			<lb />
			before the Supreme Court, in order to insure the risk arising out of export
			<lb />
			of tea, approached the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India

			Limited (&apos;ECGC&apos;), on 23.09.1993.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, ECGC issued a
			<lb />
			comprehensive risk policy on 30.09.1993, which was effective for the
			<lb />
			period spanning between 23.09.1993 and 30.09.1995.
			<lb />
			63.9 Kazakhstan Government also furnished an irrevocable guarantee,
			<lb />
			which was that, in the event Kazakhstan Corporation was unable to meet its
			<lb />
			payment obligations, it would make the payment to the exporter in US
			<lb />
			Dollars upon delivery of tea.
			<lb />
			63.10 Evidently, payment of consideration, by way of barter of goods, did
			<lb />
			not materialize. Therefore, the Kazakhstan Corporation agreed to pay the
			<lb />
			consideration in US Dollars. Some amounts were paid. However, the
			<lb />
			balance money was not paid.
			<lb />
			63.11 The Kazakhstan Government also did not fulfill its obligation due to
			<lb />
			lack of funds.
			<lb />
			63.12 Consequently, the appellants called upon ECGC, which had covered
			<lb />
			the risk to compensate them for the loss suffered by them.
			<lb />
			63.13 The ECGC repudiated the insurance contract on the ground that the
			<lb />
			appellants had rejected the barter offer made by the Kazakhstan
			<lb />
			Corporation and instead opted for payment in US Dollars.
			<lb />
			63.14 It is, in this background, that the appellants had approached the High
			<lb />
			Court for quashing the letter of repudiation issued by the ECGC.
			<lb />
			Consequential, relief was also sought that ECGC should be called upon to
			<lb />
			make payment of dues to the appellants under the contract of insurance.

			63.15 The learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court allowed the writ
			<lb />
			and came to a conclusion that though the dispute arose from a contract, the
			<lb />
			ECGC being a State under Article 12 of the Constitution was bound by the
			<lb />
			terms of the contract. In other words, the writ was held maintainable and
			<lb />
			consequential relief was also granted. However, the Division Bench in
			<lb />
			appeal reversed the judgment of the learned Single Judge on the ground
			<lb />
			that it involved disputed questions of fact which could not be adjudicated
			<lb />
			upon in a writ petition. It is, in these circumstances, that the matter reached
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court.
			<lb />
			63.16 In paragraph 8 of the judgment, the Supreme Court observed that one
			<lb />
			of the questions which fell for its consideration was whether a writ petition
			<lb />
			under Article 226 was maintainable to enforce the contractual obligation of
			<lb />
			the State or its instrumentality, by an aggrieved party. The Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			in this context made the following apposite observations in paragraphs 13
			<lb />
			&amp; 20 to 24:
			<lb />
			&quot;….13 .
			<lb />
			We do not think this Court in the above case
			<lb />
			has, in any manner, departed from the view expressed in
			<lb />
			the earlier judgments in the case cited hereinabove. This
			<lb />
			Court in the case of Life Insurance Corporation of India
			<lb />
			(Supra) proceeded on the facts of that case and held that
			<lb />
			a relief by way of a writ petition may not ordinarily be an
			<lb />
			appropriate remedy. This judgment does not lay down
			<lb />
			that as a rule in matters of contract the court&apos;s
			<lb />
			jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution is
			<lb />
			ousted. On the contrary, the use of the words &quot;court may
			<lb />
			not ordinarily examine it unless the action has some
			<lb />
			public law character attached to it&quot; itself indicates that
			<lb />
			in a given case, on the existence of the required factual
			<lb />
			matrix a remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution
			<lb />
			will be available….

			<lb />
			The learned counsel for the respondent then
			<lb />
			placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in the case of
			<lb />
			VST Industries Ltd. vs. VST Industries Workers&apos; Union &amp;
			<lb />
			Anr. In the said case, this Court held:(SCC p.306, para 8)
			<lb />
			&quot;In Anadi Mukta case this Court examined the
			<lb />
			various aspects and the distinction between an
			<lb />
			authority and a person and after analysis of the
			<lb />
			decisions referred in that regard came to the
			<lb />
			conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when
			<lb />
			the authority or the person performs a public
			<lb />
			function or discharges a public duty that Article
			<lb />
			226 of the Constitution can be invoked. In the
			<lb />
			present case, the appellant is engaged in the
			<lb />
			manufacture and sale of cigarettes. Manufacture
			<lb />
			and sale of cigarettes will not involve any public
			<lb />
			function.&quot;
			<lb />
			21
			<lb />
			Placing reliance on the observations of this Court
			<lb />
			in the said case, learned counsel contended, unless the
			<lb />
			action challenged in the writ petition pertains to the
			<lb />
			discharge of a public function or public duty by an
			<lb />
			authority, the courts will not entertain a writ petition
			<lb />
			which does not involve the performance of said public
			<lb />
			function or public duty. Learned counsel argued in the
			<lb />
			instant case while repudiating the contract, the first
			<lb />
			respondent was not discharging any public function or
			<lb />
			public duty.
			<lb />
			22
			<lb />
			We do not think the above judgment in VST
			<lb />
			Industries Ltd. (supra) supports the argument of the
			<lb />
			learned counsel on the question of maintainability of the
			<lb />
			present writ petition. It is to be noted that VST Industries
			<lb />
			Ltd. against whom the writ petition was filed was not a
			<lb />
			State or an instrumentality of a State as contemplated
			<lb />
			under Article 12 of the Constitution, hence, in the normal
			<lb />
			course, no writ could have been issued against the said
			<lb />
			industry. But it was the contention of the writ petitioner
			<lb />
			in that case that the said industry was obligated under
			<lb />
			the statute concerned to perform certain public functions;
			<lb />

		<body>
			failure to do so would give rise to a complaint under
			<lb />
			Article 226 against a private body. While considering
			<lb />
			such argument, this Court held that when an authority
			<lb />
			has to perform a public function or a public duty, if there
			<lb />
			is a failure a writ petition under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution is maintainable. In the instant case, as to the
			<lb />
			fact that the respondent is an instrumentality of a State,
			<lb />
			there is no dispute but the question is: was first
			<lb />
			respondent discharging a public duty or a public function
			<lb />
			while repudiating the claim of the appellants arising out
			<lb />
			of a contract ? Answer to this question, in our opinion, is
			<lb />
			found in the judgment of this Court in the case of Kumari
			<lb />
			Shrilekha Vidyarthi vs. State of U.P. wherein this Court
			<lb />
			held : SCC pp.236-37, paras 22 &amp; 24)
			<lb />
			&quot;The impact of every State action is also on public
			<lb />
			interest… It is really the nature of its personality as
			<lb />
			State which is significant and must characterize all
			<lb />
			its actions, in whatever field, and not the nature of
			<lb />
			function, contractual or otherwise which is decisive
			<lb />
			of the nature of scrutiny permitted for examining
			<lb />
			the validity of its act. The requirement of Article 14
			<lb />
			being the duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably,
			<lb />
			there is nothing which militates against the concept
			<lb />
			of requiring the State always to so act, even in
			<lb />
			contractual matters.&quot;
			<lb />
			23
			<lb />
			It is clear from the above observations of this
			<lb />
			Court, once State or an instrumentality of State is a party
			<lb />
			to the contract, it has an obligation in law to act fairly,
			<lb />
			justly and reasonably which is the requirement of Article
			<lb />
			14 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by the
			<lb />
			impugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants the
			<lb />
			first respondent as an instrumentality of the State has
			<lb />
			acted in contravention of the above said requirement of
			<lb />
			Article 14, then we have no hesitation that a writ court
			<lb />
			can issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary
			<lb />
			actions of the first respondent. In this context, we may
			<lb />
			note that though the first respondent is a company

			registered under the Companies Act, it is wholly owned
			<lb />
			by the Government of India. The total subscribed share
			<lb />
			capital of this company is 2,50,000 shares out of which
			<lb />
			2,49,998 shares are held by the President of India while
			<lb />
			one each share is held by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of
			<lb />
			Commerce and Industry and Officer on Special Duty,
			<lb />
			Ministry of Commerce and Industry respectively. The
			<lb />
			objects enumerated in the Memorandum of Association of
			<lb />
			the first respondent at Para 10 read:
			<lb />
			&quot;To undertake such functions as may be entrusted
			<lb />
			to it by Government from time to time, including
			<lb />
			grant of credits and guarantees in foreign currency
			<lb />
			for the purpose of facilitating the import of raw
			<lb />
			materials and semi-finished goods for manufacture
			<lb />
			or processing goods for export.&quot;
			<lb />
			Para 11 of the said object reads thus :
			<lb />
			&quot;To act as agent of the Government, or with the
			<lb />
			sanction of the Government on its own account, to
			<lb />
			give
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			guarantees,
			<lb />
			undertake
			<lb />
			such
			<lb />
			responsibilities and discharge such functions as
			<lb />
			are considered by the Government as necessary in
			<lb />
			national interest.&quot;
			<lb />
			24
			<lb />
			It is clear from the above two objects of the
			<lb />
			company that apart from the fact that the company is
			<lb />
			wholly a Government owned company, it discharges the
			<lb />
			functions of the Government and acts as an agent of the
			<lb />
			Government even when it gives guarantees and it has a
			<lb />
			responsibility to discharge such functions in the national
			<lb />
			interest. In this background it will be futile to contend
			<lb />
			that the actions of the first respondent impugned in the
			<lb />
			writ petition do not have a touch of public function or
			<lb />
			discharge of a public duty. Therefore, this argument of
			<lb />
			the first respondent must also fail….&quot;

			63.17 The Court summarized the principles in paragraph 27 of the
			<lb />
			said judgment, which, for the sake of convenience, is extracted
			<lb />
			hereafter:
			<lb />
			&quot;27. From the above discussion of ours, the following
			<lb />
			legal principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ
			<lb />
			petition :-
			<lb />
			(a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as
			<lb />
			against a State or an instrumentality of a State
			<lb />
			arising out of a contractual obligation is
			<lb />
			maintainable.
			<lb />
			(b) Merely because some disputed questions of
			<lb />
			facts arise for consideration, same cannot be a
			<lb />
			ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all
			<lb />
			cases as a matter of rule.
			<lb />
			(c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief
			<lb />
			of monetary claim is also maintainable… &quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis is mine)
			<lb />
			64. Therefore, if the aforesaid indices are applied to the facts of this
			<lb />
			case, one cannot but come to the conclusion that a writ petition would lie.
			<lb />
			65. Thus, the principles which emerge upon consideration of the
			<lb />
			judgment in ABL and Kumar Shrilesh Vidyarathi qua the aspect which
			<lb />
			arises in this case are:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			Firstly, it is nature of the respondents&quot; personality which is
			<lb />
			significant and not the nature of its function, which could be contractual or
			<lb />
			otherwise.
			<lb />
			(ii) Second, the State does not shed its personality just because it enters
			<lb />
			the contractual arena.

		<body>
			(iii) Third, there is nothing in Article 14 which indicates that the State
			<lb />
			and/or its instrumentality need not act reasonably or fairly or sans
			<lb />
			arbitrariness, when it operates in the contractual field.
			<lb />
			66. The distinction drawn earlier by the Supreme Court that a writ
			<lb />
			against a State would lie only prior to the firming up of a contract and not
			<lb />
			thereafter, has been done away after it rendered the judgment in the matter
			<lb />
			of Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi Etc. vs State Of U.P. And Ors., (1991) 1
			<lb />
			SCC 212.
			<lb />
			66.1 In the instant case, the aforementioned principles would apply with
			<lb />
			greater force as there is an element of a public law involved in the subject
			<lb />
			transaction.
			<lb />
			Therefore, whether one applies the narrower Kumar
			<lb />
			Shrilekha Vidyarathi test or the braoder ABL test, a writ petition would lie
			<lb />
			in the instant case.
			<lb />
			66.2 Thus, as in the ABL case, there is a contract in subsistence i.e. the
			<lb />
			PSC. The PSC is executed between a private party and a State. The fact
			<lb />
			that it deals with the natural resources is not in dispute. Furthermore, the
			<lb />
			fact that the extension of the contract would impact public interest is also
			<lb />
			not in doubt. The contract involves exploration of gas and oil over which
			<lb />
			the State has complete control for the reason that slightest error could have
			<lb />
			exponential impact on the country&quot;s economy. Therefore, to contend that
			<lb />
			no public law element is involved, in my view, is a contention which
			<lb />
			cannot be accepted. This apart, the allegation that there is manifest
			<lb />
			arbitrariness in the respondents refusing to extend the tenure of the PSC
			<lb />
			leaves doubt in my mind that the action is amenable to writ jurisdiction of
			<lb />
			this Court.

			67. Given these facets, what, I am required to examine is whether
			<lb />
			respondent No.1/GOI in this case is acting unfairly and/or arbitrarily in
			<lb />
			denying extension under Article 2.1 of the PSC to the petitioners. In other
			<lb />
			words, is there a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			67.1 This part of the inquiry will be made by me, while discussing issue
			<lb />
			No. III &amp; IV. Suffice it to say that so far as issue No. II is concerned, a
			<lb />
			remedy by way of a writ petition would lie. Before I conclude my view, on
			<lb />
			this issue, I may also refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Joshi
			<lb />
			Technologies International Inc, wherein, once again, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			has considered the entire gamut of case law on the issue including the
			<lb />
			decision in ABL.
			<lb />
			67.2 In that case, the Court was called upon to consider as to whether the
			<lb />
			deduction under Section 42 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short &quot;IT Act&quot;)
			<lb />
			would be available to the appellant. The contract arrived at between the
			<lb />
			appellant and the State, it appears, inadvertently or otherwise, did not make
			<lb />
			a reference to that aspect of the matter. The appellant, in fact, in the
			<lb />
			assessment years prior to 2005-2006 had obtained deduction under Section
			<lb />
			42 of the I.T. Act till it was pointed out that necessary ingredients in that
			<lb />
			behalf were not incorporated in the agreement entered into between the
			<lb />
			appellant and the respondent. Unfortunately, even though, the Ministry of
			<lb />
			Petroleum and Natural Gas supported the case of the appellant, the
			<lb />
			Ministry of Finance did not issue the necessary clarification, vis-à-vis, the
			<lb />
			contract.
			<lb />
			67.3 The Supreme Court denied relief to the appellant in that case,
			<lb />
			principally, on the ground, that in order to obtain a deduction under Section
			<lb />

		<body>
			42 of the I.T. Act, a clear stipulation in that behalf had to be provided in the
			<lb />
			contract as these were special allowances, which otherwise were not
			<lb />
			available, since the expenses incurred resulted in bringing into the
			<lb />
			existence assets of enduring nature or, were in the nature of initial
			<lb />
			expenditure which set the profit earning machinery in motion. In other
			<lb />
			words, but for Section 42 under ordinary principles of income tax law
			<lb />
			allowances claimed would not have been available as they were in the
			<lb />
			nature of capital expenditure. What is important, though, is that, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in paragraphs 68, 69 &amp; 70 had made the following
			<lb />
			observations while citing with approval the ABL case:
			<lb />
			&quot;68. The Court thereafter summarized the legal position in the
			<lb />
			following manner:
			<lb />
			&quot;27. From the above discussion of ours, following legal
			<lb />
			principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition
			<lb />
			:-
			<lb />
			(a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as
			<lb />
			against a State or an instrumentality of a State
			<lb />
			arising out of a contractual obligation is
			<lb />
			maintainable.
			<lb />
			(b) Merely because some disputed questions of
			<lb />
			facts arise for consideration, same cannot be a
			<lb />
			ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all
			<lb />
			cases as a matter of rule.
			<lb />
			(c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief
			<lb />
			of monetary claim is also maintainable.
			<lb />
			28. However, while entertaining an objection as to the
			<lb />
			maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />
		</note>
		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>
		<body>
			fact that the power to issue prerogative writs
			<lb />
			under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature
			<lb />
			and is not limited by any other provisions of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. The High Court having regard to the facts
			<lb />
			of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to
			<lb />
			entertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon
			<lb />
			itself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power
			<lb />
			(See: Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade
			<lb />
			Marks,). And this plenary right of the High Court to issue
			<lb />
			a prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the
			<lb />
			Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless
			<lb />
			such action of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary
			<lb />
			and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional
			<lb />
			mandate of Article 14 or for other valid and legitimate
			<lb />
			reasons, for which the court thinks it necessary to
			<lb />
			exercise the said jurisdiction.
			<lb />
			69. The position thus summarized in the aforesaid principles
			<lb />
			has to be understood in the context of discussion that preceded
			<lb />
			which we have pointed out above. As per this, no doubt, there is
			<lb />
			no absolute bar to the maintainability of the writ petition even
			<lb />
			in contractual matters or where there are disputed questions of
			<lb />
			fact or even when monetary claim is raised. At the same time,
			<lb />
			discretion lies with the High Court which under certain
			<lb />
			circumstances, can refuse to exercise. It also follows that under
			<lb />
			the following circumstances, &apos;normally&apos;, the Court would not
			<lb />
			exercise such a discretion:
			<lb />
			69.1 The Court may not examine the issue unless the action has
			<lb />
			some public law character attached to it.
			<lb />
			69.2 Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute is
			<lb />
			provided in the contract, the High Court would refuse to
			<lb />
			exercise its discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution and
			<lb />
			relegate the party to the said mode of settlement, particularly
			<lb />
			when settlement of disputes is to be resorted to through the
			<lb />
			means of arbitration.

			69.3 If there are very serious disputed questions of fact which
			<lb />
			are of complex nature and require oral evidence for their
			<lb />
			determination.
			<lb />
			69.4 Money claims per se particularly arising out of
			<lb />
			contractual obligations are normally not to be entertained
			<lb />
			except in exceptional circumstances.
			<lb />
			70
			<lb />
			Further legal position which emerges from various
			<lb />
			judgments of this Court dealing with different situations/aspects
			<lb />
			relating to the contracts entered into by the State/public
			<lb />
			Authority with private parties, can be summarized as under:
			<lb />
			70.1 At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts
			<lb />
			purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations
			<lb />
			of fairness.
			<lb />
			70.2 State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual
			<lb />
			field, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practice some
			<lb />
			discriminations.
			<lb />
			70.3 Even in cases where question is of choice or consideration
			<lb />
			of competing claims before entering into the field of contract,
			<lb />
			facts have to be investigated and found before the question of a
			<lb />
			violation of Article 14 of the Constitution could arise. If those
			<lb />
			facts are disputed and require assessment of evidence the
			<lb />
			correctness of which can only be tested satisfactorily by taking
			<lb />
			detailed evidence, involving examination and cross-
			<lb />
			examination of witnesses, the case could not be conveniently or
			<lb />
			satisfactorily decided in proceedings under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution. In such cases court can direct the aggrieved party
			<lb />
			to resort to alternate remedy of civil suit etc.
			<lb />
			70.9 The distinction between public law and private law
			<lb />
			element in the contract with State is getting blurred. However,
			<lb />
			it has not been totally obliterated and where the matter falls
			<lb />
			purely in private field of contract, this Court has maintained the
			<lb />
			position that writ petition is not maintainable. Dichotomy
			<lb />
			between public law and private law, rights and remedies would

		<body>
			depend on the factual matrix of each case and the distinction
			<lb />
			between public law remedies and private law, field cannot be
			<lb />
			demarcated with precision. In fact, each case has to be
			<lb />
			examined, on its facts whether the contractual relations
			<lb />
			between the parties bear insignia of public element. Once on
			<lb />
			the facts of a particular case it is found that nature of the
			<lb />
			activity or controversy involves public law element, then the
			<lb />
			matter can be examined by the High Court in writ petitions
			<lb />
			under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to see whether
			<lb />
			action of the State and/or instrumentality or agency of the State
			<lb />
			is fair, just and equitable or that relevant factors are taken into
			<lb />
			consideration and irrelevant factors have not gone into the
			<lb />
			decision making process or that the decision is not arbitrary.
			<lb />
			70.10 Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen,
			<lb />
			in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable
			<lb />
			right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may
			<lb />
			render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirements
			<lb />
			of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of
			<lb />
			the principle of non-arbitrariness.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis is mine)
			<lb />
			67.4. Therefore, as indicated above, given the facts and circumstances of
			<lb />
			the case, there would be no bar in entertaining a writ petition, even though
			<lb />
			the dispute arising between the parties falls within the realm of a contract.
			<lb />
			Issue No.III, IV &amp; V:
			<lb />
			68. The answer to these issues depends primarily upon the conclusion
			<lb />
			that one would reach vis-à-vis the scope and effect of Article 2.1. In the
			<lb />
			preceding part of my judgment, I have already set out Article 2.1 in
			<lb />
			extenso. A close perusal of Article 2.1 of the PSC would show that its
			<lb />
			initial tenure is twenty five (25) years, commencing from the effective
			<lb />
			date-which, unless it is terminated earlier, in accordance with its terms,
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">
			W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015
			<lb />

		<body>
			could be extended upon mutual agreement between the parties by a further
			<lb />
			period not exceeding five (5) years. This is the first part of Article 2.1.
			<lb />
			68.1 The second part of Article 2.1 which is contained in the proviso to
			<lb />
			the first part incorporates a situation, which is that, if the event adverted
			<lb />
			therein i.e., Commercial Production of Natural Gas, were to take place and
			<lb />
			that event was expected to continue beyond the initial term of the contract,
			<lb />
			then, the contract was mandatorily required to be extended for a further
			<lb />
			period, though not exceeding thirty five (35) years from the effective date.
			<lb />
			To this part, a limb, in a manner of speech, has been added which provides
			<lb />
			that there should mutual agreement between the parties, sufficient to permit
			<lb />
			the contractor to maximize production of natural gas in accordance with the
			<lb />
			good petroleum practice. The mandatoriness qua extension in this part is
			<lb />
			spelled out from the use of the expression &quot;shall&quot;.
			<lb />
			68.2 The last part of Article envisages that if the production of crude oil
			<lb />
			or the natural gas is expected to continue beyond the end of the relevant
			<lb />
			period referred to above, the party &apos;may&quot; agree to extend the contract for a
			<lb />
			further period upon such terms as they may mutually agree.
			<lb />
			68.3 Therefore, as alluded to above, Article 2.1, broadly, has three parts to
			<lb />
			it. The first part encapsulates the initial term which is to run for twenty five
			<lb />
			(25) years unless an early termination brings the contract to an end. This
			<lb />
			part also provides that the contract could be extended for a further period of
			<lb />
			five (5) years, based on mutual agreement arrived at between the parties.
			<lb />
			The use of the word &apos;may&apos; gives leverage to the parties qua the aspect of the
			<lb />
			extension of the contract.
			<lb />
			68.4 The second part of the contract gets triggered, once, commercial
			<lb />
			production of the gas takes place and the production is expected to continue
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">

		<body>
			beyond the end of the term of the contract. In such a situation, the Article
			<lb />
			envisages mandatory extension of the contract for a period upto but not
			<lb />
			exceeding thirty five (35) years. This aspect gets emphasized by the use of
			<lb />
			the term &apos;shall&apos;. There is an element of mutuality provided to the extension
			<lb />
			to the extent that the extension should be sufficient to permit the contractor
			<lb />
			to maximize production of natural gas in accordance with good petroleum
			<lb />
			industry practice.
			<lb />
			68.5 The last part of Article 2.1, to my is open ended inasmuch as
			<lb />
			after thirty five (35) year period is over, if the production of crude oil or
			<lb />
			natural gas is expected to continue beyond the said period, the parties are at
			<lb />
			liberty to extend the contract on mutually agreed terms. In this part, the
			<lb />
			term &apos;may&apos; is used, in a sense, as a suffix, both in respect of the decision to
			<lb />
			be taken, that is, as to whether or not the contract should be extended, and
			<lb />
			also, as to the terms on which extension is to be made.
			<lb />
			69. In the instant case, there is, as indicated above, no dispute that
			<lb />
			commercial production of natural gas has taken place and that the MC
			<lb />
			which also comprised of the representatives of respondent No.1 and
			<lb />
			respondent No.2 have come to a conclusion that its production is expected
			<lb />
			to extend to further period of ten years i.e. till 2030. If that be the situation,
			<lb />
			then, to my mind, the contract, as contended by the petitioners, is
			<lb />
			mandatorily required to be extended for a period of ten (10) years beyond
			<lb />
			the current tenure of the PSC. The argument advanced on behalf of
			<lb />
			respondent No.1/GOI that it cannot be on the same terms and conditions
			<lb />
			would have to be repelled as mutuality which is envisaged in Article 2.1 is
			<lb />
			to be such that permits the contractor to maximize production of natural gas
			<lb />
			in accordance with the good petroleum industry practice. The intent,
			<lb />
		</body>
		<note place="footnote">

		<body>
			evidently, was that the oil and natural gas contracts need a long terms
			<lb />
			perspective since investments are heavy and, therefore, once an expectation
			<lb />
			is created, based on the verifiable data, then, the terms and conditions of
			<lb />
			engagement ought not be changed qua the extended period. The fact that
			<lb />
			there is a reference to good petroleum industry practice, only fortifies this
			<lb />
			view.
			<lb />
			69.1 CII in its representation brought to fore this view generally for the
			<lb />
			benefit of all pre-NELP PSC Contractors. Certainty is the hallmark of
			<lb />
			good petroleum practice. I may also indicate herein that the petitioners are
			<lb />
			right in their contention that the subject PSC is different from the Model
			<lb />
			pre-NELP PSC inasmuch as the wordings contained in the proviso to the
			<lb />
			Model Article 2.1 are clearly different from those obtaining in the
			<lb />
			corresponding article in the PSC in issue.
			<lb />
			70. Therefore, having regard to the aforesaid, I am of the view that the
			<lb />
			petitioners are right in contending that they are entitled to the extension of
			<lb />
			the tenure of the PSC in issue. The contra argument of the respondents that
			<lb />
			since the New policy has come into play, the extension, can only be on the
			<lb />
			terms stipulated therein, according to me, is without merit for two reasons.
			<lb />
			(i) First, the New Policy cannot be used to repudiate the plain terms of the
			<lb />
			contract to the detriment of the petitioners. The execution of the PSC
			<lb />
			occurred prior to formulation of the New Policy. The New Policy was
			<lb />
			firmed up and notified during the pendency of the writ petition. The New
			<lb />
			Policy, therefore, cannot govern the terms of the PSC. (ii) Second, despite
			<lb />
			the fact the Court in its order dated 07.11.2016 had observed that the
			<lb />
			respondents&apos; decision with respect to extension could not be linked to any
			<lb />

		<body>
			policy guidelines, the respondents have attempted to do exactly the
			<lb />
			opposite without assailing the orders of this Court.
			<lb />
			70.1 Therefore, answer to all three issues has to be in favour of the
			<lb />
			petitioners and against the respondents. The petitioners are not only entitled
			<lb />
			to seek an extension, as indicated hereinabove, by me, but would be
			<lb />
			entitled to the same, based on the existing terms and conditions, that is,
			<lb />
			dehors the terms stipulated in the New Policy.
			<lb />
			70.2 Given the circumstances, as discussed above, which, show that the
			<lb />
			petitioners fall within the ambit of Article 2.1, the refusal by the
			<lb />
			respondents to extend the tenure is both arbitrary and unfair; hence,
			<lb />
			violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
			<lb />
			71. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is allowed.
			<lb />
			Respondent No.1/GOI will extend the PSC dated 15.05.1995, pertaining to
			<lb />
			the Rajasthan Block, for a period of 10 years beyond its current term i.e. till
			<lb />
			14.05.2030 as envisaged in Article 2.1 of the PSC, on the same terms and
			<lb />
			conditions. Since, the decision of the Board of Directors of respondent
			<lb />
			No.3, taken at its meeting held on 28.12.2017, was arrived at, in the
			<lb />
			backdrop of the New Policy being notified, the same would be disregarded.
			<lb />
			Respondent No.3&apos;s earlier decision dated 08.07.2016 will hold the field.
			<lb />
			72. Thus, respondent No.1/GOI will convey its decision, formally, to the
			<lb />
			petitioners, within two weeks of the date of the receipt of a copy of the
			<lb />
			order. No costs.
