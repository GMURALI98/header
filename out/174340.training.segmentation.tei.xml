			<front>REPORTABLE <lb/>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA <lb/>CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION <lb/>CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2104 of 2009 <lb/>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ....APPELLANT(S) <lb/>VERSUS <lb/>MEGA CORPORATION LIMITED <lb/>.â€¦RESPONDENT(S) <lb/>J U D G M E N T <lb/>PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. <lb/>This is a statutory appeal under Section 15Z of the Securities and <lb/>Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 1 against the final order of the Securities <lb/>Appellate Tribunal 2 , by which the Tribunal has set aside the order passed by <lb/>the Securities and Exchange Board of India 3 restricting the respondent-<lb/>company from accessing the capital market for one year and further restraining <lb/>the promoter directors from buying, selling or otherwise dealing with securities <lb/>for India. While dismissing the appeal, we have explained that the jurisdiction <lb/>of the Supreme Court under Section 15Z is confined to question of law. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. <lb/>M/s Mega Corporation Limited, listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange in <lb/>1996, is engaged in the business of radio taxi service, coupled with trading of <lb/>shares in a small measure till 2004. The attention of the share market regulator, <lb/>SEBI, was drawn to the unusual price movement of the scrip of the Company <lb/>between January 2005 to September 2005. The Company&apos;s shares traded <lb/>between Rs. 4.25/-to Rs. 43.85/-. This upward spurt resulted in an increase in <lb/>the average monthly volume of shares to 1,56,22,583 shares. Having observed <lb/>this activity, the SEBI directed investigation while passing an ex parte ad <lb/>interim order under Section 11B, 11(4) (b) and 11(D) of the Act against 56 <lb/>entities, being the Company, its promoter-directors, some of its clients, <lb/>stockbrokers and depositors. After hearing the objections, the interim orders <lb/>were confirmed, and a show-cause notice for violation of Regulations 3(a), (b), <lb/>(c)&amp;(d) and 4(1), 4(2)(k) &amp; 4(2)(r) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and <lb/>Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 4 was <lb/>issued on 10.10.2007. <lb/>3. <lb/>The show cause notice was premised on the information obtained after <lb/>investigation on the following: <lb/>3.1 The Company made huge profits from undeclared business and <lb/>sale of scrips and there is uncertainty about the source of income. <lb/>It is not known whether the Company had amended its <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4 hereinafter referred to as &apos;PFUTP Regulations&apos;. <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 3 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>Memorandum and Articles for undertaking the activity of trading. <lb/>The surge in the profits is unusual, and there is no reasonable <lb/>explanation for the same. This is violative of Regulation 3 of the <lb/>PFUTP Regulations. <lb/>3.2 Between April 2005 to September 2005, the Company and other <lb/>noticees issued public statements in the form of advertisements <lb/>and other notifications to lure the public in investing in the <lb/>Company. This activity was undertaken to create an artificial <lb/>demand knowing fully well that this is not the truth of the matter. <lb/>This is in violation of Regulation 4(2)(k) and 4(2)(r) of the PFUTP <lb/>Regulations. <lb/>3.3 The Company manipulated its profits by selling shares through <lb/>orchestrated deals which were detected in the investigation. The <lb/>manipulations led to an artificial increase of the scrip to a <lb/>phenomenal extent sub-serving the fraudulent intention of the <lb/>Company, and this is again violative of Regulation 3 of the PFUTP <lb/>Regulations. <lb/>4. <lb/>The Company and other noticees filed their responses. After hearing all <lb/>parties, the SEBI passed the final order dated 28.02.2008 holding that the <lb/>Company has violated the provisions of the Act and the PFUTP Regulations. <lb/>In the exercise of its powers under Sections 11 and 11B read with Section 19 <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 4 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>of the Act and the PFUTP Regulations, SEBI restrained the Company from <lb/>accessing the capital market in any manner and its directors from dealing in <lb/>securities for one year. The operative portion of the order is as follows: <lb/>&quot;4.1 Now, therefore, I in exercise of powers conferred <lb/>upon me under Section 11 and 11B read with Section 19 of <lb/>the SEBI Act, 1992 further read with PFUTP Regulations <lb/>2003, hereby restrain Mega Corporation Limited (PAN-<lb/>AAC-CM-9506-E) from accessing the capital market in any <lb/>manner whatsoever for a of period of one year (1 year) and <lb/>Shri Kunal Lalani (PAN-AAG-OPL-0992-C), Shri Himanshu <lb/>Mehta (PAN-AAL-PM-5750-F) and Shri Surendra Chhalani <lb/>(PAN-ACI-PC2863-K) Directors of the company are hereby <lb/>restrained from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in <lb/>securities, in any manner, for a period of one year <lb/>(1 year).&quot; <lb/>5. <lb/>The Company filed an appeal under Section 15T of the Act being Appeal <lb/>No. 60 of 2008 before the Tribunal. The Tribunal re-examined the three <lb/>circumstances which became the basis of SEBI decision and finally allowed the <lb/>appeal, by its judgment dated 15.10.2008. The Tribunal held: <lb/>5.1 The unusual profits, if any, made during the year 2004-05 by itself <lb/>cannot constitute any transgression of law. The powers vested in <lb/>the Board are only to ensure that investors are not misled in <lb/>making investments based on fraud and allurement and that there <lb/>is nothing unusual about investors being attracted when the <lb/>Company comes with positive annual reports. The Tribunal held <lb/>that extraordinary profits in itself cannot be the basis for <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Page 5 of 24 <lb/></note>

			<body>concluding that the Company&apos;s accounts are manipulated with a <lb/>specific objective to mislead the investors. <lb/>5.2 On the issue of public statements in the form of advertisements <lb/>and notifications dated 07.04.2005 and 20.04.2005, the Tribunal <lb/>concluded that there is nothing wrong in the advertisements issued <lb/>for entering into the business of foreign exchange with the launch <lb/>of &apos;Mega Forex Brand&apos; and also the announcement relating to tour <lb/>services based on the agreement with Gems Tours and Travels <lb/>Private Limited. The Tribunal found that these announcements <lb/>were in the ordinary course of business, and there was sufficient <lb/>evidence to that effect. Having considered facts in detail, the <lb/>Tribunal reversed the findings of the SEBI. <lb/>5.3 Finally, the Tribunal also examined the allegation relating to <lb/>manipulation. It considered the findings of the SEBI that the <lb/>transactions were orchestrated through entities that had links with <lb/>the Company. On reappreciation the Tribunal found that the <lb/>alleged links were not established and that the Board had <lb/>unnecessarily read into certain activities, a meaning which could <lb/>not be inferred in the ordinary course of events. <lb/>It is in this context that the Tribunal proceeded to accept the <lb/>submission made on behalf of the Company that the Board could <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 6 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>not have relied on the letter of the stockbroker contradicting the <lb/>stand taken by it without giving an opportunity of cross-<lb/>examination. Because such an opportunity was not granted, the <lb/>Tribunal held that the principles of natural justice stood violated. <lb/>6. <lb/>The present appeal under Section 15Z of the Act is against this judgment <lb/>of the Tribunal. We heard Shri C.U. Singh, Senior Advocate, assisted by Shri <lb/>Pratap Venugopal for SEBI and Shri Vaibhav Gaggar, appearing on behalf of <lb/>the Company. <lb/>7. <lb/>On behalf of the Board, Shri C.U. Singh, Senior Advocate, submitted <lb/>that: <lb/>7.1 The Tribunal examined the order passed by SEBI in a disjointed <lb/>manner by taking each incident as a standalone event and gave its <lb/>finding as if they were separate events. In its approach to examine <lb/>the events as independent episodes, the Tribunal misled itself in <lb/>coming to the wrong conclusions. Shri Singh took us through the <lb/>orders passed by SEBI and the final judgment of the Tribunal and <lb/>submitted that the findings of SEBI are correct and that the <lb/>Tribunal is wrong in each of its conclusions. He also submitted <lb/>that the events depicting manipulation are correctly identified, and <lb/>they are based on the evidence available on record and, therefore, <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 7 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>the Tribunal was not justified in interfering with findings of <lb/>manipulation. <lb/>7.2 Disapproving the principle adopted by the Tribunal about the right <lb/>of cross-examination, he submitted that such an approach would <lb/>virtually disable SEBI from performing its functions. Reliance was <lb/>placed on the judgments of this Court in K.L Tripathi 5 , Tara <lb/>Chand Vyas 6 and Jah Developers 7 . <lb/>8. <lb/>Shri Vaibhav Gaggar, in his reply, submitted that: <lb/>8.1 The appeal has to be dismissed as there is no question of law <lb/>involved in the case. <lb/>8.2 The approach adopted by SEBI in focusing on the sudden spurt in <lb/>profit of the Company, is itself, is wrong approach. He sought to <lb/>demonstrate that there is no unusual income in the profit of the <lb/>Company. <lb/>8.3 On the issuance of advertisements, Shri Gaggar showed us the <lb/>factual background leading to the advertisements and stated that <lb/>there is no indication of any intention to mislead the public or lure <lb/>the investors on the statements made therein. He submitted that the <lb/>findings of the Tribunal that the advertisements were not in <lb/></body>

			<body>violation of the Regulations are based on the correct facts as <lb/>evidenced by the material placed before the Board. Reliance was <lb/>placed on the judgment of the Tribunal in M/s Vijay Textile. 8 <lb/>8.4 Shri Gaggar submitted that the conclusions drawn by the Board on <lb/>the assumption that the sales were orchestrated through artificial <lb/>purchase and sale are incorrect. He endeavoured to establish that <lb/>the assumed link between the parties is non-existent and only <lb/>imaginary. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in <lb/>Rakhi Trading 9 and Kishore Ajmera 10 . <lb/>8.5 A final submission was made on the ground that principles of <lb/>natural justice would be violated if an opportunity to cross-<lb/>examine is not granted in a case where a material adverse to the <lb/>party is taken cognisance by SEBI. In support of this, decisions of <lb/>this Court in the judgments in Meenglas 11 , Bareilly <lb/>Electricity 12 and Swadeshi Cotton Mills 13 were relied on. <lb/>9. <lb/>In his rejoinder, Shri Singh has distinguished the cases cited by <lb/>Shri Gaggar and referred to precedents to establish that there is no right to <lb/></body>

			<body>cross-examination of a witness and the principles of natural justice would not <lb/>require granting a right of cross-examination. He reiterated that the functioning <lb/>of the SEBI will be hampered if this formality is to be followed in every case. <lb/>10. The following issues arise for consideration: <lb/>10.1 What is the scope and ambit of statutory appeal to the Supreme <lb/>Court under Section 15Z of the Act against an order passed by <lb/>the Securities Appellate Tribunal? <lb/>10.2 Whether the advertisements dated 07.04.2005 and 20.04.2005, <lb/>are in violation of Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) read with <lb/>Regulation 4 (1), (2) (k) and (r) as amounting to misleading and <lb/>defrauding the investors? <lb/>10.3 Whether the Company has violated Regulations 3(a), (b), (c) and <lb/>(d) and Regulation 4(1), 4(2)(k) and 4(2) (r) of the SEBI (PFUTP) <lb/>Regulations, 2003 by manipulating the share prices and <lb/>accounts? <lb/>10.4 Whether there is a right to cross-examine the author of a <lb/>document if SEBI seeks to rely on that document which is against <lb/>the interest of the company? <lb/>11. Before we consider the rival contentions based on the issues, as <lb/>formulated above, it is necessary to take note of certain statutory provisions. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 10 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>Section 11 of the Act enumerates the functions of the SEBI and empowers it to <lb/>take measures for protecting the interests of investors in securities. <lb/>Section 11B empowers SEBI to issue necessary directions. In exercise of its <lb/>powers under Section 30 the SEBI made the PFUTP Regulations, of which, we <lb/>are concerned with Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulations 4(1), 4(2)(k) <lb/>and 4(2)(r). <lb/>ISSUE 1: What is the scope and ambit of statutory appeal to the Supreme Court <lb/>under Section 15Z of the Act against an order passed by the Securities <lb/>Appellate Tribunal? <lb/>12. The power and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to consider the <lb/>decisions of the Tribunal is provided in Section 15Z of the Act. The said <lb/>provision is as under: <lb/>15Z. Appeal to Supreme Court. Any person aggrieved by any <lb/>decision or order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal may <lb/>file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from <lb/>the date of communication of the decision or order of the <lb/>Securities Appellate Tribunal to him on any question of law <lb/>arising out of such order; <lb/>Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that <lb/>the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing <lb/>the appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a <lb/>further period not exceeding sixty days. <lb/>In Videocon International 14 this Court had an occasion to deal with <lb/>Section 15Z. Having considered the amendment to the Section, the Court <lb/>observed as under: <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">14 Videocon International Ltd. v. Securities Exchange Board of India (2015) 4 SCC 33. <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 11 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;38. â€¦..A right of appeal may be absolute, i.e., without any <lb/>limitations. Or, it may be a limited right. The above position <lb/>is understandable, from a perusal of the unamended and <lb/>amended Section 15-Z of the SEBI Act. Under the unamended <lb/>Section 15-Z, the appellate remedy to the High Court, against <lb/>an order passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, was <lb/>circumscribed by the words &quot;...on any question of fact or law <lb/>arising out of such order&quot;. The amended Section 15-Z, while <lb/>altering the appellate forum from the High Court to the <lb/>Supreme Court, curtailed and restricted the scope of the <lb/>appeal, against an order passed by the Securities Appellate <lb/>Tribunal, by expressing that the remedy could be availed of <lb/>&quot;...on any question of law arising out of such order.&quot;. It is, <lb/>therefore apparent, that the right to appeal, is available in <lb/>different packages, and that, the amendment to Section 15-Z, <lb/>varied the scope of the second appeal provided under the <lb/>SEBI Act.&quot; <lb/>13. Though the Court observed that the appellate jurisdiction is curtailed to <lb/>determining only a question of law, the question still remains as to which issues <lb/>qualify as questions of law and which issue do not. We will examine this. <lb/>14. On a &apos;textual&apos; interpretation, the expression &apos;question of law&apos; is defined <lb/>in the Black&apos;s Law Dictionary as follows: <lb/>&quot;1. An issue to be decided by the judge, concerning the <lb/>application or interpretation of the law; <lb/>2. A question that the law itself has authoritatively answered, <lb/>so that the Court may not answer it as a matter of discretion; <lb/>3. An issue about what the law is on a particular point; an <lb/>issue in which parties argue about, and the court must decide <lb/>what the true rule of law is; <lb/>4. An issue that, although it may turn on a factual point, is <lb/>reserved for the court and excluded from the jury; an issue <lb/>that is exclusively within the province of the judge and not the <lb/>jury&quot; 15 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">15 Black&apos;s Law Dictionary, 10 th Edition p. 1442. <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 12 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>15. Reference to Law Dictionary for the meaning of the expression &apos;question <lb/>of law&apos; is not to overlook the difficulty in drawing boundaries between <lb/>questions of law and fact. Under the subject, the malleable boundaries between <lb/>law and fact, H.W.R Wade has commented: <lb/>&quot;Much of the discussions of this chapter proceeds on the <lb/>basis that the distinction between a question of law and a <lb/>question of fact is self-evident. But this is not so; the <lb/>boundary is often elusive.&quot; 16 <lb/>16. Phrases such as, &apos;question of law&apos;, are open textual expressions, used in <lb/>statutes to convey a certain meaning which the legislature would not have <lb/>intended to be read in a pedantic manner. When words of the Sections allow <lb/>narrow as well as wide interpretations, courts of law have developed the art and <lb/>technique of finding the correct meaning by looking at the words in their <lb/>context. In Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance Investment <lb/>Company Ltd. &amp; Ors. 17 , Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy, observed: <lb/>&quot;33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. <lb/>They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the <lb/>text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither <lb/>can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is <lb/>best which makes the textual interpretation match the <lb/>contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it <lb/>was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, <lb/>first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, <lb/>phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, <lb/>in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-<lb/></body>

			<body>maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, <lb/>clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear <lb/>different than when the stature is looked at without the <lb/>glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must <lb/>look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, <lb/>each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and <lb/>designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No <lb/>part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in <lb/>isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word <lb/>has a place and everything is in its placeâ€¦â€¦&quot; <lb/>17. <lb/>The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Section 15Z to consider <lb/>any question of law arising from the orders of the Tribunal should therefore be <lb/>seen in the &apos;context&apos; of the powers and jurisdiction of the Tribunal under <lb/>Sections 15K, 15L, 15M, 15T, 15U and 15Y of the Act. It is in the functioning <lb/>of the Tribunal to re-examine all questions of fact at the appellate stage while <lb/>exercising jurisdiction under Section 15T of the Act. In Clariant 18 and National <lb/>Securities Depository 19 , this Court had an occasion to examine the jurisdiction <lb/>of the Tribunal and explain that the Tribunal has wide powers. Being a <lb/>permanent body, apart from acting as an appellate Tribunal on fact, the Tribunal <lb/>routinely interprets the Act, Rules and Regulations made thereunder and <lb/>evolves a legal regime, systematically developed over a period of time. The <lb/>advantage and benefit of this process is consistency and structural evolution of <lb/>the sectorial laws. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">18 Clariant International Ltd. and Anr. v. Securities and Exchange Board of India <lb/>(2004) 8 SCC 524, para 73, 74 <lb/>19 <lb/>National Securities Depository Ltd. v. Securities Exchange Board of India <lb/>(2017) 5 SCC 517, para 9. <lb/></note>

			<body>18. It is in the above-referred context that the Supreme Court while <lb/>exercising appellate jurisdiction under Section 15Z of the Act would be <lb/>measured in its approach while entertaining any appeal from the decision of the <lb/>Tribunal. This freedom to evolve and interpret laws must belong to the <lb/>Tribunals to subserve the regulatory regime for clarity and consistency and it is <lb/>with this perspective that the Supreme Court will consider appeals against <lb/>judgment of the Tribunals on questions of law arising from its orders. <lb/>19. It is in this very context that the UK Supreme Court in the case of Jones <lb/>v. First Tier Tribunal, 20 formulated certain principles for appellate courts to <lb/>interfere against the orders of Tribunals on the ground of existence of questions <lb/>of law. The Court held as under: <lb/>&quot;16 â€¦ It is primarily for the tribunals, not the appellate <lb/>courts, to develop a consistent approach to these issues [of <lb/>law and fact], bearing in mind that they are peculiarly well <lb/>fitted to determine them. A pragmatic approach should be <lb/>taken to the dividing line between law and fact, so that the <lb/>expertise of tribunals at the first tier and that of the Upper <lb/>Tribunal can be used to best effect. An appeal court should <lb/>not venture too readily into this area by classifying issues as <lb/>issues of law which are really best left for determination by <lb/>the specialist appellate tribunals.&quot; <lb/>20 Jones v. First Tier Tribunal [2013] UKSC 19. Para 16; followed in Regina (Privacy <lb/>International) v. Investigatory Powers Tribunal [2019] UKSC 22, para 134; See also, <lb/>Administrative Law by Paul Craig (8 th Ed. 2016 at p.492 and H.R.W. Wade &amp; C.F <lb/>Forsyth, Administrative Law, Chapter 8 (Oxford University Publication, United <lb/>Kingdom, 11th Edn, 2014). <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 15 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>20. The scope of appeal under Section 15Z may be formulated as under: <lb/>20.1 The Supreme Court will exercise jurisdiction only when there is <lb/>a question of law arising for consideration from the decision of <lb/>the Tribunal. A question of law may arise when there is an <lb/>erroneous construction of the legal provisions of the statute or the <lb/>general principles of law. In such cases, the Supreme Court in <lb/>exercise of its jurisdiction of Section 15Z may substitute its <lb/>decision on any question of law that it considers appropriate. <lb/>20.2 However, not every interpretation of the law would amount to a <lb/>question of law warranting exercise of jurisdiction under Section <lb/>15Z. The Tribunal while exercising jurisdiction under Section <lb/>15T, apart from acting as an appellate authority on fact, also <lb/>interprets the Act, Rules and Regulations made thereunder and <lb/>systematically evolves a legal regime. These very principles are <lb/>applied consistently for structural evolution of the sectorial laws. <lb/>This freedom to evolve and interpret laws must belong to the <lb/>Tribunal to subserve the Regulatory regime for clarity and <lb/>consistency. These are policy and functional considerations <lb/>which the Supreme Court will keep in mind while exercising its <lb/>jurisdiction under Section 15Z. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 16 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>21. We will now examine the other issues in the context of the scope and <lb/>ambit of the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Section 15Z as <lb/>discussed herein above. <lb/>ISSUE 2: Whether the advertisements dated 07.04.2005, 20.04.2005, are in <lb/>violation of Regulations 3 (a), (b), (c), (d) read with Regulation 4 (1), (2) (k) <lb/>and (r) as amounting to misleading and defrauding the investors? <lb/>22. This issue should not detain us for long, as the facts involved in this issue <lb/>are relating to the merits of the case and, as such, do not qualify as a question <lb/>of law. We will however refer to the two instances as Shri C.U. Singh has made <lb/>detailed submissions before us. <lb/>23. As per the first advertisement dated 07.04.2005, it was alleged by SEBI <lb/>that in violation of Regulation 4 (2) (k) and 4 (r) of the PFUTP Regulations, the <lb/>Company proceeded to announce on 07.04.2005 the launch of the worldwide <lb/>outbound package tour services. These services were intended to operate across <lb/>25 cities in India and were expected to achieve a revenue of Rs. 1000 million <lb/>with a net profit of Rs.200 million in its first year. SEBI alleges that this <lb/>announcement was made for the sole purpose of misleading the investors. This <lb/>finding is reversed by the Tribunal based on an agreement between the <lb/>Company and M/s Gem Tours and Travels Private Limited to establish a <lb/>subsidiary company called &apos;Mega Holidays Ltd.&apos; to handle the tour services. <lb/>The Tribunal also noted the bank statement supporting the Company&apos;s <lb/>transaction with M/s Gem Tours and Travels Private Limited. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 17 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>24. We are mentioning these facts only to indicate that the Tribunal has <lb/>reversed the findings of SEBI on the basis of its own inferences drawn from the <lb/>documents on record. The decision of the Tribunal is fact-based and does not <lb/>give rise to any question of law for invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme <lb/>Court under Section 15Z. For this reason, we are not inclined to interfere with <lb/>the finding of fact, which must rest with the conclusions drawn by the Tribunal. <lb/>25. So far as the second announcement dated 20.04.2005 is concerned, it <lb/>relates to the allegation of announcing the commencement of business in <lb/>foreign exchange with the launch of &apos;Mega Forex Brand&apos;. It was alleged that <lb/>the Company made false statements such as that it is expected to grab 5-10% <lb/>of the market share in the forex market, &quot;which is at 5-6 billion dollars&quot; in a <lb/>span of one or two years. Here again, the Tribunal concluded that the <lb/>application for a license to deal with foreign exchange which is alleged to have <lb/>been made in September 2005 was only a revised application. The revised <lb/>application is said to have been made in as a reply to the queries of the Reserve <lb/>Bank of India on their original application, which was in fact made on <lb/>14.04.2005, that is even before the announcement. The Tribunal, therefore, was <lb/>of the opinion that the announcement is not imaginary but is based on specific <lb/>steps taken before the date of announcement, lending credence to the said <lb/>activity. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 18 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>26. The conclusion is drawn by the Tribunal, being factual, not giving rise <lb/>to any question of law, the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 15Z cannot <lb/>be invoked. For this reason, we affirm the finding of the Tribunal and there is <lb/>no occasion for this court to interfere with the decision of the Tribunal. The <lb/>issue is answered against the appellant. <lb/>ISSUE 3: Whether the company has violated Regulations 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) <lb/>and Regulation 4(1), 4(2)(k) and 4(2) (r) of the SEBI (PFUTP) Regulations, <lb/>2003 by manipulating the share prices and accounts? <lb/>27. The next submission relates to the allegation that the accounts are <lb/>manipulated for the year 2004-05 to show inflated profits to lure investors into <lb/>buying shares of the company. SEBI has referred to the efforts made by it to <lb/>trace the devise by which the shares of the Company were bought and sold in <lb/>the market. It was alleged that more than 2 crores shares were purchased by <lb/>certain entities in the physical form in &apos;off-market&apos; deals and then transferred <lb/>those shares in subsequent &apos;off-market&apos; deals to certain other outside entities <lb/>connected to the company. These allegations necessitated proof of such &apos;off-<lb/>market&apos; transactions and the connectivity of the &apos;outside entitles&apos; with the <lb/>Company. <lb/>28. The Tribunal in its appellate jurisdiction came to the conclusion that the <lb/>connectivity could not be established and that the conclusions drawn by the <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 19 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>Board were insufficient. On the basis of the inferences drawn from the facts, <lb/>the Tribunal rendered the following findings: <lb/>&quot;There is no evidence in support of any definite sustainable <lb/>link between the appellant company and any of the traders <lb/>who allegedly traded in the appellant company&apos;s scrip with <lb/>the purpose of generating volumes and thereby raising its <lb/>price. The charge of manipulative trading in its own shares <lb/>by the appellant company, therefore, fails. <lb/>â€¦. <lb/>But it is another matter to say that a company has manipulated its <lb/>accounts with that specific object in view because there can be a <lb/>multitude of reasons why an unscrupulous management may want <lb/>to show inflated financial results in its accounts. In the present <lb/>case, no material has been produced by the Respondent to <lb/>establish that the manipulation is the annual accounts of the <lb/>appellant for the year 2004-05, if any, had been resorted to with <lb/>the objective of luring investors to buy the scrip of the company. <lb/>Given the lack of any definite evidence, this charge against the <lb/>appellant also fails.&quot; <lb/>29. It is evident from the above that the findings are based on the Tribunal&apos;s <lb/>inferences drawn from the material available on record. The conclusions drawn <lb/>by the Tribunal do not give rise to any question of law warranting interference <lb/>of this court under Section 15Z of the Act. This issue is answered against the <lb/>appellant. <lb/>ISSUE 4: Whether there is a right to cross-examine the author of a letter if the <lb/>SEBI seeks to rely on that letter, adverse to the company? <lb/>30. The Board has, in its investigation, secured a letter from one of the <lb/>directors of M/S DPS Shares and Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd., the stockbrokers of <lb/>the company. This letter contradicts the stand taken by the company in its <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 20 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>defence. This happened in the following factual background. When asked to <lb/>explain the transaction relating to purchase and sale of scrip in somewhat <lb/>suspicious circumstances, the Company took refuge by stating that the <lb/>transactions were in the exclusive knowledge of the stockbroker company. The <lb/>Board, in its investigation, secured a letter from a stockbroker stating that their <lb/>two directors, one Shri Pratik Shah and one Shri Sujal Shah, had handled the <lb/>transactions in the alleged scrip by opening a current account by using dummy <lb/>resolutions without the knowledge of Shri Dinesh Masalia, the third director of <lb/>the stockbroker company. On this basis, it was concluded that the transaction <lb/>was fictitious. In defence, the Company sought permission to cross-examine <lb/>the said Shri Dinesh Masalia, but no permission was granted. SEBI proceeded <lb/>and gave its final orders on 07.01.2008. It is in this context that the Company <lb/>made its submission before the Tribunal that principles of natural justice were <lb/>violated because an opportunity to cross-examine is not presented. <lb/>31. There is no dispute that the Company and the directors were informed <lb/>about the letter elicited from Shri Dinesh Masalia. The show-cause notice <lb/>explicitly mentions it. The Company&apos;s reply to the show-cause notice <lb/>evidences objections raised by the Company with respect to the stand taken by <lb/>Shri Dinesh Masalia. To this extent, opportunity was given to the Company, in <lb/>the sense that SEBI was relying on a document which was disclosed to the <lb/>Company. The only question is whether there is a right to cross-examine the <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 21 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>author of a letter while SEBI is performing its regulatory role and deciding <lb/>upon the allegation of manipulation under Regulations 3 and 4 of the PFUTP <lb/>Regulations. <lb/>32. Shri C.U Singh arguing for the Board has denied any right to cross-<lb/>examine while SEBI exercises its jurisdiction. In support of his submissions, <lb/>he has referred to the cases as indicated earlier. He has also argued that there is <lb/>no prejudice caused to the Company as an opportunity was given by handing <lb/>over the material relied on by the Board against which the Company gave its <lb/>reply. He also referred to judgments of this Court in Aligarh Muslim <lb/>University 21 and A.S Motors 22 to press the point that the Court will not insist on <lb/>examination of witnesses merely as an empty formality. <lb/>33. On the other hand, Shri Gaggar submitted that the ground that principles <lb/>of natural justice would clearly be violated if opportunity to cross-examine is <lb/>not granted. <lb/>34. Immediately after the parties were heard, and the judgment was reserved <lb/>on 17.02.2022, on the very next day, another Bench of this Court delivered its <lb/>judgment in T. Takano 23 . The case relates to proceedings that arose under this <lb/>very same Act and in fact concerning allegations of fraudulent and unfair trade <lb/></body>

			<body>practices adopted by the appellants therein under the PFUTP regulations. This <lb/>Court considered the issue as to the statutory obligation of SEBI to follow the <lb/>principles of natural justice. Having reviewed the entire case law on the subject, <lb/>this Court formulated the following principles: <lb/>&quot;62. The conclusions are summarised below: <lb/>(i) The appellant has a right to disclosure of the material <lb/>relevant to the proceedings initiated against him. A deviation <lb/>from the general rule of disclosure of relevant information <lb/>was made in Natwar Singh (supra) based on the stage of the <lb/>proceedings. It is sufficient to disclose the materials relied on <lb/>if it is for the purpose of issuing a show cause notice for <lb/>deciding whether to initiate an inquiry. However, all <lb/>information that is relevant to the proceedings must be <lb/>disclosed in adjudication proceedings; <lb/>(ii) The Board under Regulation 10 considers the <lb/>investigation report submitted by the Investigating Authority <lb/>under Regulation 9, and if it is satisfied with the allegations, <lb/>it could issue punitive measures under Regulations 11 and <lb/>12. Therefore, the investigation report is not merely an <lb/>internal document. In any event, the language of Regulation <lb/>10 makes it clear that the Board forms an opinion regarding <lb/>the violation of Regulations after considering the <lb/>investigation report prepared under Regulation 9; <lb/>(iii) The disclosure of material serves a three-fold purpose of <lb/>decreasing the error in the verdict, protecting the fairness of <lb/>the proceedings, and enhancing the transparency of the <lb/>investigatory bodies and judicial institutions; <lb/>(iv) A focus on the institutional impact of suppression of <lb/>material prioritises the process as opposed to the outcome. <lb/>The direction of the Constitution Bench of this Court in <lb/>Karunakar (supra) that the non-disclosure of relevant <lb/>information would render the order of punishment void only <lb/>if the aggrieved person is able to prove that prejudice has <lb/>been caused to him due to non-disclosure is founded both on <lb/>the outcome and the process; <lb/>(v) The right to disclosure is not absolute. The disclosure of <lb/>information may affect other third-party interests and the <lb/>stability and orderly functioning of the securities market. The <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 23 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>respondent should prima facie establish that the disclosure of <lb/>the report would affect third-party rights and the stability and <lb/>orderly functioning of the securities market. The onus then <lb/>shifts to the appellant to prove that the information is <lb/>necessary to defend his case appropriately; and <lb/>(vi) Where some portions of the enquiry report involve <lb/>information on third-parties or confidential information on <lb/>the securities market, the respondent cannot for that reason <lb/>assert a privilege against disclosing any part of the report. <lb/>The respondents can withhold disclosure of those sections of <lb/>the report which deal with third-party personal information <lb/>and strategic information bearing upon the stable and <lb/>orderly functioning of the securities market.&quot; <lb/>35. As per the principles laid down in the above referred case, there is a right <lb/>of disclosure of the relevant material. However, such a right is not absolute and <lb/>is subject to other considerations as indicated under paragraph 62(v) of the <lb/>judgment above referred. In this judgment, there is no specific discussion on <lb/>the issue of a right to cross-examination but the broad principles laid down <lb/>therein are sufficient guidance for the Tribunal to follow. There is no need for <lb/>us to elaborate on this point any further. <lb/>36. Coming back to the facts of the present case, we have noticed that the <lb/>Tribunal has arrived at its conclusions based on independent facts concerning <lb/>(a) the allegations under Regulation 4 relating to the issuance of misleading <lb/>advertisements dated 07.04.2005 and 20.04.2005 as well as (b) allegations <lb/>relating to manipulation of scrip prices and profits to lure investors. As <lb/>indicated earlier, the Tribunal concluded that the allegations could be proved. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 24 of 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>As we are not interfering in the findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal the <lb/>Company&apos;s claim for cross-examining would pale into insignificance. This <lb/>question presents itself merely as an academic issue. <lb/>37. We are also of the opinion that, there was no necessity for the Tribunal <lb/>to lay down as an inviolable principle that there is a right of cross-examination <lb/>in all cases. In fact, the conclusion of the Tribunal based on evidence on record <lb/>did not require such a finding. We, therefore, set aside the findings of the <lb/>Tribunal to this extent while upholding its decision on all other grounds. We <lb/>would also leave the question of law relating to the right of cross-examination <lb/>open and to be decided in an appropriate case by this Court. <lb/>38. For the reasons stated above, while we dismiss Civil Appeal No. 2104 of <lb/>2009 against the judgment of the Securities Appellate Tribunal in Appeal <lb/>No. 60 of 2008 dated 15.10.2008, the general observations of the Tribunal that <lb/>there is a right of cross-examination is hereby set aside. <lb/>39. Parties to bear their own costs. <lb/>â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦J. <lb/>[L. NAGESWARA RAO] <lb/>â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦J. <lb/>[PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA] <lb/>NEW DELHI. <lb/>MARCH 25, 2022 </body>
