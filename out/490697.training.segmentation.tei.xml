			<body>defendants after the latter have rendered accounts; for costs of the suit and <lb/>pass such further or other orders as this Hon&apos;ble Court may deem fit and <lb/>necessary in the circumstances of the case and thus render justice. <lb/>For Plaintiffs <lb/>: Mr.C.Karthick <lb/>For Mr.Arun C. Mohan <lb/>For Defendants <lb/>: Mr.U.Karunakaran (For D2) <lb/>J U D G M E N T <lb/>Mr.C.Karthick, learned counsel representing Mr.Arun C.Mohan <lb/>learned counsel on record for the plaintiffs is before this Commercial Division. <lb/>To be noted, there are two plaintiffs. <lb/>2. Crux and gravamen of the plaint is a complaint of infringement <lb/>of copyright in label in a pouch / sachet and passing off qua trade dress. The <lb/>products are automobile oils and lubricants. Before proceeding further with <lb/>the merits of the matter, it is necessary to set out the trajectory of this <lb/>litigation. <lb/>3.There are two defendants. First defendant is an individual and <lb/>the constitution of the second defendant was not known to the plaintiffs at <lb/>the time of institution of the suit. Second defendant goes by the name &apos;Shree <lb/>Siddhi Auto Centre&apos;. <lb/>4.Both defendants were duly served with suit summons, but both <lb/>defendants did not enter appearance through counsel to resist the suit before <lb/>this Commercial Division. <lb/>5.Both defendants were set ex parte on 14.06.2017 and the suit <lb/>itself was set down for recording exparte evidence. Ex parte evidence was <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">4 <lb/></note>

			<body>recorded on 14.09.2017 by learned Additional Master II. One witness i.e., <lb/>PW1 was examined and 10 Exhibits, i.e., Ex.P1 to Ex.P10, were marked. <lb/>Under such circumstances, when the matter was listed before me for <lb/>arguments, Mr.U.Karunakaran, learned counsel was before this Commercial <lb/>Division. Learned counsel submitted that he has instructions to represent <lb/>defendant No.2. Mr.U.Karunakaran very fairly submitted that defendant No.2 <lb/>has nothing to do with the manufacturing and marketing of the alleged <lb/>offending pouch/sachet, which is the basis for the suit of infringement of the <lb/>copyright and passing off qua trade dress. <lb/>6.Learned counsel submitted that the second defendant has <lb/>innocently purchased the product from the market and has used it in his small <lb/>two wheeler spare parts shop. It was also submitted by the learned counsel <lb/>that second defendant is willing to swear to an affidavit that he will <lb/>henceforth not deal with the offending product. <lb/>7.Considering the fair submissions made, notwithstanding the said <lb/>ex parte order dated 14.06.2017, I set aside the said order in so far as second <lb/>defendant is concerned and permitted Mr.U.Karunakaran to file an affidavit to <lb/>this effect. <lb/>8.I also directed the deponent to be present today, <lb/>i.e., 21.02.2018. Mr.M.Nagesh, son of M.Yellaiah, who is carrying on business <lb/>as sole proprietor in the name and style &apos;Shree Siddhi Auto Centre&apos;, is before <lb/>this Commercial Division. An affidavit dated 21.02.2018 sworn by <lb/>Mr.M.Nagesh, has been placed before this Commercial Division along with a <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">5 <lb/></note>

			<body>photocopy of his Aadhar Card, which is self-attested. <lb/>9.Mr.M.Nagesh, who is present in this commercial division, <lb/>re-iterated the contents of the aforesaid affidavit. As I was informed that <lb/>Mr.Nagesh is conversant in Telugu only, he was accompanied by his brother-<lb/>in-law, whom I am informed, is a practising Lawyer in Hyderabad, whose <lb/>assistance was taken for translation. The aforesaid affidavit dated 21.02.2018 <lb/>along with the photocopy of the Aadhar Card is marked as Exhibit P11 series. <lb/>10.Going back to the lis, the pouch /sachet and the label therein <lb/>over which, the plaintiffs claim copy right, has been marked as Ex. P10 and <lb/>the same is as follows:-<lb/>11.The alleged offending pouch /sachet has been marked as Ex.P8 <lb/>and the same is as follows: <lb/></body>

			<body>12.PW1 is one Mr.Murlidhar Balasubramanian, who is the power of <lb/>Attorney agent of the plaintiffs. The Special Power of Attorney, in this regard, <lb/>has been marked as Ex. P1. The Board resolution, which is an extract of the <lb/>Board Meeting on 13.02.2012, in this regard, has been marked as Ex. P2. <lb/>13.Plaintiffs also have a trademark registration for the word <lb/>&apos;CASTROL&apos; in Class 4 with regard to Oil for heating, lighting and lubricating. <lb/>This is trademark No.1494. <lb/>14.To be noted, this trade mark stands in the name of <lb/>C.C.Wakefield &amp; Company Limited. This certificate has been marked as Ex.P3. <lb/>Considering the scope of the lis, I am not going into the details of the trade <lb/>mark. Suffice to say that there is a word mark over which also the plaintiffs <lb/>claim rights. <lb/>15.To be noted, suit pertains to copy right infringement and <lb/>passing off qua trade dress. One more product of the plaintiffs, which is not a <lb/>pouch /Sachet, but a plastic container has also been marked as Ex. P5 and <lb/>the same is as follows: <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<body>16.It appears that the plaintiff has been using the label <lb/>continuously for its product. Plaintiffs has been using it from 1979. The details <lb/>of turnover of the goods of the second plaintiff bearing the trademark <lb/>CASTROL sold with the aforesaid mark/ label are articulated in paragraph <lb/>No.10 of the plaint. The advertisement expenses incurred by the plaintiffs are <lb/>articulated in Paragraph No.11 of the plaint. I deem it appropriate to extract <lb/>paragraph Nos.10 and 11 of the same. The same is read as follows: <lb/>&quot;10.The annual turnover of the goods sold by the <lb/>2nd plaintiff in India bearing the trademark CASTROL with the <lb/>distinctive artistic work, colour combination, packaging, trade <lb/>dress, get up and lay out for the following years is given <lb/>below:-<lb/>Year <lb/>Approximate <lb/>turnover <lb/>(in crores of Rs.) <lb/>2009 <lb/>26,852,300,000 <lb/>2010 <lb/>31,387,300,000 <lb/>2011 <lb/>34,392,300,000 <lb/>2012 <lb/>36,053,800,000 <lb/>11.The plaintiffs have been advertising extensively their <lb/>products through various printed media including newspapers, <lb/>magazines and trade journals, leaflets and other promotional <lb/>literature depicting, the said trademarks which have been <lb/>extensively distributed to all the plaintiffs&apos; dealers throughout <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></note>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>the country. The plaintiffs also advertises its products through <lb/>electronic media which are viewed, listened by substantial <lb/>number of population throughout the world. The annual <lb/>expenditure incurred by the 2nd plaintiff in India on advertising <lb/>and publicity of the products bearing the trademark CASTROL <lb/>with the distinctive colour scheme, get-up, layout and <lb/>arrangement of features for the following years is given <lb/>below:-<lb/>Year <lb/>Approximate <lb/>turnover <lb/>(in crores of Rs.) <lb/>2009 <lb/>1,494,600,000 <lb/>2010 <lb/>1,624,000,000 <lb/>2011 <lb/>1,271,100,000 <lb/>2012 <lb/>1,127,000,000 <lb/>17.I have perused the affidavit of PW1. It is cogent and is a <lb/>reiteration of the pleadings in the plaint paragraph. Notwithstanding the fact <lb/>that these are ex parte proceedings, I have compared the aforesaid two labels <lb/>i.e., Exs. P10 and P8. I have compared the aforesaid two marks keeping in <lb/>mind the Parle Principle set out in the celebrated judgment of Hon&apos;ble <lb/>Supreme Court in Parle Products (P) Ltd. Vs. J.P. and Co., [(1972) 1 <lb/>SCC 618]. I deem it appropriate to extract paragraph 9 of the said judgment <lb/>which reads as follows : <lb/>&quot;9.It is, therefore, clear that in order to come to the <lb/>conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, <lb/>the broad and essential features of the two are to be <lb/>considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">9 <lb/></note>

			<body>there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they <lb/>are of such character as to prevent one design from being <lb/>mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned <lb/>mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as <lb/>would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to <lb/>accept the other if offered to him. In this case we find that the <lb/>packets are practically of the same size, the colour scheme of <lb/>the two wrappers is almost the same; the design on both <lb/>though not identical bears such a close resemblance that one <lb/>can essily be mistaken for the other. The essential features of <lb/>both are that there is a girl with one arm raised and carrying <lb/>something in the other with a cow or cows near her and hens or <lb/>chickens in the foreground. In the background there is a farm <lb/>house with a fence. The word &quot;Gluco Biscuits&quot; in one and <lb/>&quot;Glucose Biscuits&quot; on the other occupy a prominent place at the <lb/>top with a good deal of similarity between the two writings. <lb/>Anyone in our opinion who has a look at one of the packets <lb/>today may easily mistake the other if shown on another day as <lb/>being the same article which he had seen before. If one was not <lb/>careful enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on <lb/>the plaintiffs&apos; goods, he might easily mistake the defendants&apos; <lb/>wrapper for the plaintiffs&apos; if shown to him some time after he <lb/>had seen the plaintiffs&apos;. After all, an ordinary purchaser is not <lb/>gifted with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Homes. We <lb/>have therefore no doubt that the defendants&apos; wrapper is <lb/>deceptively similar to the plaintiffs&apos; which was registered. We do <lb/>not think it necessary to refer to the decisions referred to at the <lb/>bar as in our view each case will have to be judged on its own <lb/>features and it would be of no use to note on how many points <lb/>there was similarity and in how many others there was absence <lb/>of it. &quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>18.In other words, I saw Ex.P10, took it away from the sweep of <lb/>my eye and little later, I saw Ex.P8. I asked myself the question as to <lb/>whether a man of average intelligence with imperfect recollection <lb/>and ordinary prudence will be lulled into the belief that what he is <lb/>seeing now (Ex.P8) is what he saw earlier (Ex.P10). I have no doubt <lb/>in my mind that an emphatic yes is the answer. In the light of the aforesaid <lb/>narrative, I now turn to the affidavit of the second defendant which has been <lb/>marked as Ex. P11 today. Ex. P11, affidavit of the second defendant reads as <lb/>follows: <lb/>&quot;I, M.Nagesh, S/o.M.Yellaiah, aged about 51 years <lb/>OCC Business, C/o.Shree Siddi Auto Centre, Nampally, <lb/>Hyderabad, temporarily come down to Chennai, do hereby <lb/>solemnly affirm and sincerely state as follows:-<lb/>1.I am the 2nd respondent in the above suit and <lb/>hence, I am aware of the facts stated hereunder. <lb/>2.I respectfully state that the plaintiff has filed the <lb/>above suit for the following reliefs: <lb/>A) perpetual injunction restraining the defendants by <lb/>themselves, <lb/>their <lb/>proprietor/partners, <lb/>heirs, <lb/>legal <lb/>representatives, successors in business, assigns, servants, <lb/>agents, dealers, retailers, distributors, stockiest, representatives, <lb/>assigns or any of them from and in any manner infringing the <lb/>plaintiffs copyright in Castrol 2T oil label with distinctive color <lb/>scheme of green, red and while with black/red and white <lb/>lettering, getup, layout, artistically returned words and literally, <lb/>graphic and diagrammatic contents by use of New Super fast 2T <lb/>oil labels, by making a substantial reproduction thereof or an <lb/>imitation thereof or in any other manner whatsoever. <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">12 <lb/></note>

			<body>F)For costs of the suit. <lb/>3) I respectfully state that I am running a small <lb/>retailer Two Wheeler Spare Parts shopt at No.11-6-380/7&amp;14, <lb/>Goods Shed Road, Nampalli, Hyderabad-4. I state that I am not <lb/>selling the oil with a brand viz., New Super Fast 2T oil as claimed <lb/>by the plaintiff further I am not in possession of the alleged <lb/>Super Fast 2T oil in my shop and in any event I hereby alleged <lb/>products in my shop. <lb/>4) I respectfully state that I have no objection to <lb/>grant the relief of A &amp; B as claimed in the plaint as I am not <lb/>dealing with the said alleged products. The relief of C,D,E &amp; F <lb/>may be dismissed as against me as I am not dealing with the <lb/>alleged product. Further I have no objections to grant reliefs to <lb/>the plaintiff as against the first defendant as claimed in the <lb/>plaintiff. <lb/>It is therefore, prays that this Hon&apos;ble Court may be <lb/>pleased to record this affidavit and pass a decree in the above <lb/>CS and thus render Justice.&quot; <lb/>19.In the light of the Ex. P11, affidavit from the second defendant, <lb/>the plaintiffs counsel submits that the plaintiffs would give up their prayers <lb/>contained in the sub-paragraphs (c),(d),(e),(f) and (g) of paragraph No.25 of <lb/>the plaint against second defendant alone. To be noted paragraph No.25 of <lb/>the plaint is the prayer paragraph. <lb/>20.I deem it appropriate to extract the entire paragraph No.25 of <lb/>the plaint, which reads as follows: <lb/>&quot;(a) a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants by <lb/>themselves, <lb/>their <lb/>proprietor/partners, <lb/>heirs, <lb/>legal <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/>14 <lb/></note>

			<body>(d) The defendants be directed to pay to the plaintiffs as <lb/>compensatory and punitive damages a sum of Rs.10,00,000/-in <lb/>respect of acts of infringement of copyright and passing off <lb/>committed by them; <lb/>(e) A preliminary decree be passed in favour of the plaintiffs <lb/>directing the defendants to render account of profits made by <lb/>use of the offending trade dress, imitative labels, infringing <lb/>trademarks for marketing their offending products and a final <lb/>decree be passed in favour of the plaintiffs for the amount of <lb/>profits thus found to have been made by the defendants after <lb/>the latter have rendered accounts. <lb/>(f) For costs of the suit and <lb/>(g) Pass such further or other orders as this Hon&apos;ble Court may <lb/>deem fit and necessary in the circumstances of the case and <lb/>thus render justice. <lb/>21.It is recorded that plaint prayers contained in sub-paragraphs <lb/>(c) to (g) of paragraph No.25 of the plaint are given up and those prayers will <lb/>stand dismissed as against the second defendant alone. Axiomatically there <lb/>will be a decree against the second defendant with regard to the plaint <lb/>paragraph No.25 (a) and (b). In other words, there will be a decree against <lb/>the second defendant in terms of sub-paragraphs (a )and (b) of paragraph 25 <lb/>of the plaint. <lb/>22.However, in the light of the trajectory of the litigation, which <lb/>has been alluded to supra as the plaintiffs have proved their claim beyond any <lb/>spec of doubt, there shall be a decree against the first defendant with regard <lb/>to all limbs of the suit prayer. <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<body>23.When I say all the limbs there shall be a decree in terms of sub-<lb/>paragraph (a) to (e) of paragraph 25 of the plaint. <lb/>24.With regard to costs, as the plaintiffs have been compelled to <lb/>carry on their litigation for nearly half a decade to its logical end, I deem it <lb/>appropriate to decree the suit as against the first defendant alone. With <lb/>regard to the residuary prayer contained in sub-paragraph (g) of paragraph <lb/>25 of the plaint, as against the first defendant alone, it will be open to the <lb/>plaintiffs to seek damages and to sue for appropriate relief after enforcement <lb/>of the prayers pertaining to accounts and surrender of offending materials, if <lb/>the damages are quantified beyond Rs.10,00,000/-. <lb/>25.To be noted sub-paragraph (d) of the plaint prayer pertains to <lb/>damages is decreed as against the first defendant alone. <lb/>26.Suit is decreed with costs, against first defendant. <lb/>27.Suit is decreed against second defendant with regard to sub-<lb/>paragraph (a) and (b) alone of paragraph 25 of plaint and sub-paragraph (c) <lb/>to (g) of paragraph 25 have been given ups as against second defendant. <lb/>Consequently, connected applications are closed. <lb/>21.02.2018 <lb/>maya <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>
