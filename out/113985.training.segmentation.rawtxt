ADVOCATES, FOR THE RESPONDENTS 
IN THE RESPECTIVE PETITIONS. 

Reserved on: 08.12.2021 
Decided on: 31.12.2021 
____________________________________________________________________ 
These petitions coming on for hearing this day, Hon'ble Mr. Justice 

Satyen Vaidya, passed the following: 

O R D E R 

All these petitions are being decided together by a common judgment as 

identical questions of fact and law are involved. 

The questions, posed for determination herein, have arisen from 

happening of events which have sequentially continued for inordinate period of 

more than six years. 

2. 
Government of Himachal Pradesh had created posts of Junior Office 

Assistant (Information and Technology), Class-III, Non-Gazetted [for short, 

"JOA (IT")] for recruitment in its various Administrative Departments. Common 

Recruitment and Promotion Rules (for short, "2014 Rules") for the post JOA (IT) 

were notified on 24 th December, 2014. The minimum educational and other 

qualifications for the direct recruitment were prescribed as under: -

(a) 
ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATION:-

(i) 
10+2 from a recognized Board of School Education/University. 

(ii) 
One year Diploma in Computer Science/Computer Application/ 
Information 
Technology 
from 
a 
recognized 
University/Institution. 

(iii) 
Computer typing speed of 30 words per minute in English or 25 
words per minute in Hindi. 

OR 

(i) 
10+2 from a recognized Board of School Education/University.

(ii) 
'O' or 'A' level Diploma from National Institute of Electronics & 
Information Technology (NIELIT). 

(iii) 
Computer typing speed of 30 words per minute in English or 25 
words per minute in Hindi. 

(b) 
DESIRABLE QUALIFICATION(S).-Knowledge of customs, 
manner and dialects of Himachal Pradesh and suitability for 
appointment in the peculiar conditions prevailing in the Pradesh." 

3. 
The Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission (for short 

"HPSSC") vide Advertisement No. 30/2015 dated 13.02.2015 invited 

applications from the eligible candidates for appointment to 1421 posts of 

JOA(IT). Though the prescribed minimum essential qualifications were 

as per R&P Rules, still, besides the candidates having qualifications as per 

advertisement, a large number of candidates falling under one of the 

following categories were also provisionally admitted by HPSSC: 

(i) 
Those who either held qualification higher to the prescribed 

qualifications; 

(ii) 
those who were having prescribed qualifications but from 

institutes which were not considered as recognized; 

(iii) those who held qualification equivalent to the prescribed 

qualification. 

This anomalous situation was result of the prevalent procedure 

which required applications to be submitted online without supporting 

documents merely on the basis of declaration of candidate made in the 

online recruitment applications. However, there was clear stipulation in 

the advertisement that the candidates must ensure their eligibility in 

respect of category, experience, age and essential qualification(s) etc. as

per requirement of the post advertised to avoid rejection at later stage. 

4. 
Having received the applications from large number of candidates 

whose educational qualifications were not strictly in accordance with the 

prescription made either in the 2014 Rules or the advertisement, HPSSC 

started to seek clarification from the State Government since as far back 

as 4.11.2015, when for the first time HPSSC sought clarification from 

State Government by posing questions as under: 

"1. Whether a certificate or diploma issued by any registered institute 

operating within the state of H.P. or from outside the state is valid 

for determining eligibility for recruitment to the post of Junior 

Office Assistant (IT) or such certificates issued by recognized 

institutes are to be accepted. 

2. A list of registered/recognized institutes whose diplomas/certificates 

are valid/recognized for determining eligibility for the post. 

3. Any other clarification/guidelines as deemed fit in respect of the

The process seeking clarification continued thereafter as is evident 

from series of correspondence dated 25.02.2016, 27.12.2016, 29.5.2017,

In absence of any decision from the State Government, HPSSC 

continued with selection process. A written objective type test was held on 

10.04.2016. Total 12473 candidates qualified the test and were called to 

undertake Skilled Typing Test. 10271 candidates appeared for the Skilled 

Typing Test and 4092 candidates qualified and were called for interviews 

which were scheduled from 13.05.2017 to 12.07.2017. Candidature of all

candidates, except those who were found to be holding qualification

8. 
The process for recruitment to the post of Junior Office

The requisite qualifications for the post are as under:-

"EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION:-

(i) 10+2 from a recognized Board of School Education/ 

University.

aforesaid educational qualifications. However, prima facie, it is 

made out that they are holding one year diploma in Computer. In 

such circumstances, there shall be a direction in the interim to the 

respondent-Commission to permit the applicant(s), who admittedly 

have already appeared in the written/typing test, to appear in the 

interview, provisionally. However, their result shall not be 

declared and instead kept in a sealed cover till the matter with 

regard to equivalence of the diploma held by them with the 

diploma required as per the aforesaid educational qualifications is 

considered and decided by the newly added respondent No.2-State, 

which shall be done as expeditiously as possible, but within a 

reasonable timeframe. 

10. 
It shall be the responsibility of each of the applicants to 

produce certified copy of this order before the Secretary to 

respondent No.1-Commission forthwith. 

All these original applications were later registered as CWPOA Nos. 

2253, 2289, 2290, 2388, 2394 and 7681 of 2020 in this Court after 

abolition of the Tribunal. 

6. 
On 21.8.2017, the State Government directed HPSSC to go ahead 

with the recruitment process in terms of decision taken by the equivalence 

committee formed for the purpose. The communication dated 21.08.2017 

reads as under: -

"I am directed to refer to your letter No. HPSSC 8(2)-862/15-

13161 dated 14th July, 2017 and also the other references seeking 

clarification on the subject cited above and to say that the matter has 

been considered at the Government Level in compliance of the directions 

passed by the Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal in OA 

No. 2994 of 2017 and other various similar OA's pending adjudication 

before the Hon'ble, Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal that the 

applicant(s) be permitted to appear in the interview, provisionally and

their result should be kept in sealed cover till the matter with regard to 

equivalence of the diploma held by them with the diploma required as per 

prescribed educational qualification in rules is considered and decided by 

the State. While passing these orders the Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh 

candidates are holding one year diploma in Computer though 

nomenclature of the one year diploma held by them in Computer is not in 

consonance with the nomenclature as prescribed. The Government after 

having detailed examination and convening a meeting of all concerned 

departments has arrived at the following decisions: 

(1). All such candidates having one year Diploma in Computer or 

higher qualification in Computer Science/Application/IT from any 

private Institution like from. Society under Societies Act. Rashtrya 

Saksharta Mission IT programme/Skill Development Programme 

etc. be considered for final selection subject to having successfully 

passed their skill test i.e. Typing Test on Computer and after 

having obtained their undertaking/declaration certifying that they 

had attended the classes/diploma course by attending the classes 

regularly. 

(2). That the Computer Science is not limited to the specific 

nomenclature of Diploma prescribed in the R&P Rules, as such, 

the Diplomas in Computer and other Higher Qualifications 

belonging to Computer Science/application Irrespective of their 

nomenclature be also considered for final selection subject to 

having successfully passed their skill test i.e. Typing Test on 

Computer and alter having their undertaking/declaration certifying 

that they had attended the classes/diploma course by attending the 

classes regularly. There may be instance where certificates are 

issued instead of diploma, In: such cases, the Commission is to 

ascertain and ensure that subjects stadled, are at par with one year 

Diploma course in Computer Science/Application/IT. 

(3). The date of personal interview of the candidate concerned in 

the instant case be treated as valid date for evaluation/

consideration/acceptance 
of 
his/her 
diploma/ 
essential 

qualification. 

(4). With regard to educational qualification, as informed during 

the meeting, the Commission has sought clarification of 

equivalence in some cases from the concerned authorities, 

therefore, the Commission need to proceed further in accordance 

with the clarification/decision obtained from the State Level Board 

of Equivalence Committee/H.P. Board of School Education by 

accepting the qualification of such candidate(s) for this job if that 

is found equivalent to 10+2 and valid for pursuing higher studies." 

The decision so taken and conveyed was subsequently approved by 

the State Cabinet on 18.09.2017. 

7. 
In pursuance to the above noticed decision of the Government, 

HPSSC reviewed the selection process and allowed those candidates to be 

considered for selection, who had earlier been rejected. Appointments 

were accordingly offered and made. Consequently, many candidates 

though eligible as per R&P Rules, could not find place in the merit of 

selected candidates. This triggered another round of litigation. Some of 

these candidates approached the Tribunal by way of OA No. 5543 of 2017 

which later came to be registered as CWPOA 34 of 2019 in this Court and 

is also being decided herein. Since this Original Application was filed 

after declaration of final select list of HPSSC and all the selected persons 

were impleaded as private respondents with the aid of order 1 Rule 8 of 

the Code of Civil Procedure.

8. 
Thus, following two sets of litigations arose out of selection 

process undertaken by HPSSC for posts of JOA (IT) under Post Code 447 

(hereinafter referred to as "JOA 447") 

(i) 
OA Nos. 2830, 2989, 2994, 2998, 3009 and 3026 of 2017 

(later registered as CWPOA Nos. 2253, 2289,2290,2388,2394 and 

7681 of 2020 in this Court after abolition of the Tribunal) by 

candidates whose candidature for JOA 447 was rejected by HPSSC 

for not possessing qualification as per R&P Rules. 

(ii) 
OA No. 5543 of 2017 (later registered as CWPOA 34 of 

2019 in this Court) by candidates who failed to find their names in 

select list as a consequence of decision dated 21.8.2017 

9. 
The above-mentioned litigation gave rise to the issue, Whether 

the decision dated 21.8.2017/18.9.2017 of State Government qualified 

the test of legality and fairness, if so, whether the selections made by 

HPSSC to JOA 447, in pursuance to such decision, were valid? 

10. 
For adjudication of above question, in the first instance, we 

propose to consider the challenge raised by petitioners in CWPOA No. 34 

of 2019 which has been filed for following reliefs: 

"i. That Annexure A-2 clarification dated 21 st of 
August 2017 issued by respondent number 1 may be 
quashed and set aside. Further Annexure A-3 office 
order dated 8 of September 2017 may also be 
quashed and set aside. 

ii. That the respondent number 2 may be directed to 
prepare merit list of candidates possessing essential 
and minimum qualification mention in the 
advertisement No.3/2015 dated 13.2.2015 and 
recommend their names for recruitment." 

11. 
Petitioners in CWPOA 34 of 2019 have raised following grounds 

for seeking the reliefs as noticed above: 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 13:02:34 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

111 

a) Respondents could not have prescribed additional 
mode of selection. 
b) There was no power to relax the R&P Rules vis-a-vis 
essential qualification. 
c) The entire exercise was done with oblique motive to 
allow the ineligible candidates. 
d) It nullified the effect of R&P Rules. 
e) Those persons also became eligible who had acquired 
minimum qualifications on dates subsequent to the last 
date of submission of applications. 
f) The changes in R&P Rules could be made only by due 
process of law. 

12. The genesis of dispute can be traced from the following expression 

used in 2014 Rules:-

"One year Diploma in Computer Science/Computer Application/ 
Information 
Technology 
from 
a 
recognized 
University/Institution". 

Firstly, there appeared to be a confusion with respect to import of 

expression "recognized University/Institution" and secondly, in respect 

of diploma qualification having been held by the candidates under 

different nomenclatures. The dispute arose when many candidates 

applied for JOA 447 claiming to have Diploma in the same subjects as 

prescribed in 2014 Rules but with different nomenclature and the other 

dispute was raised in respect of authority which was to recognize the 

institutes issuing requisite Diploma. Another area of discord was created 

by the candidates having higher qualification. As evident from the said 

clause of 2014 Rules, no specific nomenclature of required diploma was 

prescribed. It was mentioned only as diploma in computer 

science/computer application/information technology, whereas more than 

one type of curriculum could be said to have satisfied the requirement in 

this behalf. As regards recognized university is concerned, there could not

H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

112 

be any dispute regarding the authority having jurisdiction to recognize the 

university, but it was totally unclear as to which was the authority whose 

recognition was valid vis-a-vis the institution prescribed by 2014 Rules. 

13. 
Before adverting to the merits of ground or objections raised in 

CWPOA No.34 of 2019, it is relevant to notice that Original Application 

was filed before the Tribunal after the process of appointments to the post 

of JOA (IT) (post code-447) was completed by respondents. Noticeably, 

neither the selection process undertaken by HPSSC for JOA 447 nor the 

selections made thereby are under challenge. It is also to be noticed that 

the decision of the State Government dated 21.08.2017 to allow candidates 

for selection other than the candidates having qualification strictly as per 

the R&P Rules was ratified and confirmed by an ex-post facto sanction 

granted by the State Cabinet on 18 th September, 2017 and such decision of 

the Government has also not been assailed. Simply, the prayer made in the 

original application seeking directions to HPSSC to prepare merit list of 

candidates possessing essential and minimum qualification mentioned in 

the advertisement No.3/2015 dated 13.02.2015 may not suffice in the 

absence of the reliefs as noticed above 

14. 
In the aforesaid backdrop, we now proceed to consider the 

objections raised by petitioners in CWPOA 34 of 2019. A challenge has 

been laid to the competence and power of the State Government to relax 

R&P Rules and also to prescribe additional mode of selection. It has been 

contended that change in R&P Rules could not be made by administrative 

instructions without adoption of due process as envisaged under law. The

H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

113 

contention so raised by the petitioners deserves rejection, for the reasons 

that firstly the 2014 Rules, vide Clause 18 reserves power of relaxation in 

favour of State Government. The relevant Clause reads as under: -

"18. Power to relax.-Where the State Govt. is of the opinion 
that it is necessary or expedient to do so, it may, by order for 
reasons to be recorded in writing and in consultation with the 
Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission, relax any of 
the provision(s) of these rules with respect to any class or 
category of person(s) of post(s). 

By virtue of decision dated 21.08.2017 confirmed by State Cabinet on 

18.09.2017, it was decided that the category of persons sought to be 

selected required elaboration. This power to relax is vested in the State 

Government, in case State Government finds it necessary or expedient to 

do so. The only prescription that appears to have been lacking in the 

instant case is that the Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission was 

not consulted before the aforesaid decision. The right of consultation with 

Public Service Commission is prescribed by Article 320(3) of the 

Constitution, however, the Proviso to Article 320 empower the Governor 

of State to make Regulations specifying matters exempted from prior 

consultation process of the Public Service Commission. In exercise of such 

powers "The Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission (Exemption 

from consultation) Regulations, 1973" have been framed. As per 

Regulation 3 thereof the exemption from consultation extends to services 

and posts specified in Schedule to such Regulations and clause 8(i) of the 

Schedule relates to selection and recommendation for making recruitment 

to Class III posts, excepting certain categories which in any case does not

. P . 

114 

include the post of JOA(IT). Thus the relaxation of 2014 Rules undertaken 

by the State Government was within its competence and powers. 

15. 
Secondly, it is evident from the facts detailed hereinabove that the 

prescriptions of requisite qualification be it in 2014 Rules or in the 

advertisement could not be said to be unambiguous. The subjects of 

Computer Science or Information Technology cannot be restricted only to 

the nomenclature used in R&P Rules/advertisement. Both these subjects 

carry within them more than one type of curriculum. Thus, in the absence 

of any clarity as to the kind of curriculum required as pre-condition for 

eligibility, the decision of the State Government dated 21.08.2017 read 

with cabinet decision dated 18.09.2017 cannot be faulted. In addition, 

there was also no clarity as to the authority whose recognition was valid, 

vis-a-vis, the institutions competent to award requisite Diploma. The 

repeated correspondence inter-se the HPSSC and the State Government is 

evidences this fact. Further, the material discussed by the equivalence 

committee appointed by the State Government also warrants the same 

conclusion. Support can be drawn from the fact that common R&P Rules 

for the post of JOA (IT) have been amended by the State Government in 

2020 (for short, "2020 Rules"), the relevant extract thereof reads as under: 

"(a) ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATION(S): 
(i) Should have passed 10+2 from a recognized 
Board of School Education/University. 
OR 
Matriculation from recognized Board of School 
Education 
with 
one/two 
year's 
Diploma/Certificate from an Industrial Training 
Institute (ITI) in Information Technology 
Enabled Sectors (ITES) as notified by Director 
General of Employment & Training (Govt. of 
India) from time to time or three years Diploma 
in Computer Engineering/Computer Science/IT

115 

from Polytechnic as approved by All India 
Council for Technical Education (AICTE);" 

Record reveals that one of the considerations for amendment of these 

Rules was the imprecise provision as to the exact kind of diploma required 

and also the authority which was empowered to authorise the institutions 

to award the requisite diploma. The 2020 Rules now appears to have 

clearly prescribed the institutes whose diploma will be valid as also the 

nomenclature of the diploma as will be relevant for considering the 

selection and appointment to the post of JOA (IT). 

16. 
Thirdly, it cannot be ignored that multifarious litigations had 

erupted as a result of the ambiguous 2014 Rules and the posts of JOA (IT) 

involved therein were required to be filled on urgent basis. The number of 

posts advertised as well as their usefulness in almost all the departments of 

the Government underlined the importance and urgency involved. 

Apparently, Class-III, Non-Gazetted posts of JOA (IT) became necessity 

in all the departments as a result of advent of computerization and 

information technology. In order to cope with the requirements of 

personnel having basic knowledge in computer, these posts were created. 

The records further reveal that even after the selection process undertaken 

for JOA 447, hundreds of more posts of JOA (IT) came to be advertised 

later through advertisement for post codes 556 and 817. 

17. 
Fourthly, the exercise to constitute equivalence committee was 

under taken in pursuance to the judicial order passed by the Tribunal on 

30.6.2017. This order was never assailed by anyone including the 

petitioners in the instant petition. This being so, the deviation made by the 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 13:02:34 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

116 

State Government from R&P Rules in the aforesaid manner cannot be 

faulted. 

18. 
Last but not the least, there is nothing on record from which it can 

be inferred that the impugned action of the State Government/HPSSC had 

some extraneous motive or was not bonafide. The contention of the 

petitioners that the entire exercise of respondents was with oblique motive 

to allow ineligible candidate is to be ignored without any tangible material 

on record in support or substantiation thereto. 

19. 
The contention raised by the petitioners that by the aforesaid action 

of the respondents, those persons also became eligible who had acquired 

the eligibility after the cutoff date prescribed in the advertisement is also 

required to be rejected for the reason that the petitioners have miserably 

failed to provide details in respect of such category of persons. In absence 

of such details no relief can be granted to the petitioners particularly in the 

view of the nature of dispute that involves more than one categories of 

candidates. The contention of petitioners, if was to be upheld, would have 

required such category of persons to be identified separately. Even 

otherwise there is no trite law that the employer cannot change the 

prescription during continuation of selection process. This can be said with 

more certainty in the given facts and circumstances of the case where there 

was urgency and the time taken to amend ambiguous Rules would have 

caused prejudice to the employer.

recruitment/selection process cannot be made subject matter of judicial 

review merely on the ground that the employer has changed/ amended the 

rule(s) after initiation of the process. Reference in this regard can be 

placed on judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Maharashtra 

Public Service Commission Through Its Secretary; Ashok Tukaram 

Barde Vs. Sandeep Shriram Warade and Others; Suhas Sudhakarrao 

Lavhekar and Others Etc. Etc., (2019) 6 SCC 362, wherein it has held 

as under: 

[9] The essential qualifications for appointment to a post are for 

the employer to decide. The employer may prescribe additional or 

desirable qualifications, including any grant of preference. It is the 

employer who is best suited to decide the requirements a candidate 

must possess according to the needs of the employer and the nature 

of work. The court cannot lay down the conditions of eligibility, 

much less can it delve into the issue with regard to desirable 

qualifications being at par with the essential eligibility by an 

interpretive re-writing of the advertisement. Questions of 

equivalence will also fall outside the domain of judicial review. If 

the language of the advertisement and the rules are clear, the Court 

cannot sit in judgment over the same. If there is an ambiguity in 

the advertisement or it is contrary to any rules or law the matter 

has to go back to the appointing authority after appropriate orders, 

to proceed in accordance with law. In no case can the Court, in the 

garb of judicial review, sit in the chair of the appointing authority 

to decide what is best for the employer and interpret the conditions 

of the advertisement contrary to the plain language of the same. 

To similar effect is exposition made by Hon'ble Supreme Court in State 

of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Raghuveer Singh Yadav, (1994) 6 SCC 151, 

which reads as under:

[5] It is not in dispute that Statutory Rules have been made 

introducing Degree in Science or Engineering or Diploma in 

Technology as qualifications for recruitment to the posts of 

Inspector of Weights and Measures. It is settled law that the State 

has got power to prescribe qualifications for recruitment. Here is a 

case that pursuant to amended Rules, the government has 

withdrawn the earlier notification and wants to proceed with the 

recruitment afresh. It is not a case of any accrued right. The 

candidates who had appeared for the examination and passed the 

written examination had only legitimate expectation to be 

considered of their claims according to the rules then in vogue. The 

amended Rules have only prospective operation. The government 

is entitled to conduct selection in accordance with the changed 

rules and make final recruitment. Obviously, no candidate acquired 

any vested right against the State. Therefore, the State is entitled to 

withdraw the notification by which it had previously notified 

recruitment and to issue fresh notification in that regard on the 

basis of the amended Rules. 

21. 
Thus, the contentions raised by petitioners in CWPOA No. 34 of 

2019 are rejected and the process of selection and appointment already 

concluded by the respondents against Post Code 447 is upheld. In view of 

the declaration of selection process for Post Code 447 as legal and valid, 

the petitions i.e. CWPOA No. 2253, 2289, 2290, 2388, 2394 and 7681 of 

2020 have been rendered infructuous as the relief sought in all such

petitions was to allow the persons other than those having qualifications 

strictly as per R & P Rules/advertisement in the selection process. 

22. 
While the selection process for JOA 447 was still experiencing the 

turmoil of rival claims, as detailed above, HPSSC, undertook yet another 

process for selection of 1156 posts of JOA (IT) in pursuance to 

advertisement No. 32-3/2016 dated 18.10.2016 (post code 556) 

(hereinafter referred to as JOA 556) for brevity, out of which 85 posts 

were to be filled on regular basis in Excise Department and the rest were 

to be filled on contract basis. The Essential Minimum Qualification this 

time also remained as per prescription of 2014 Rules. Again, the online 

applications were submitted by all categories of candidates, as in the case 

of JOA 447, and the already existing confusion aggravated. As noticed 

above, the selection process for JOA 447 stood completed in September, 

2017 from perspective of respondents, notwithstanding, pending litigation 

for rival claims. Faced again with dilemma, HPSSC once again sought 

clarification from the State Government regarding criteria to be adopted 

for selection process against post code 556. In response, the State 

Government vide letter dated 19.03.2018 directed HPSSC to implement 

the clarification earlier issued vide communication dated 21.8.2017 in the 

on-going process against post code 556 also. Contents of letter dated

Despite communication dated 19.3.2918 from State Government 

to the HPSSC, the selections for JOA 556 were ultimately made strictly in 

accordance with 2014 Rules. Noticeable, a sequence of events took place 

after publication of JOA 556 Advertisement which ostensibly made the 

HPSSC to ignore directions of Government. A glance at such events shall 

be material to understand the background. 

24.1. An Original Application No. 2644 of 2018 (CWPOA 7585 of 

2019) titled Akshay Sharma Vs State of Himachal Pradesh and others was 

preferred before the Tribunal laying challenge to the communication dated 

9.3.2018 of the State Government. On 16.8.2018 the Tribunal passed 

interim order in OA 2644 of 2018 in following terms: 

"In the facts and circumstances, materials on record and interest of 
justice, subject to keeping fifteen posts of Junior Office Assistant 
vacant post for the applicants and final outcome of the original 
applications, respondent No.3-Commission shall be free to declare 
the result of the process for recruitment to the post of Junior Office 
Assistants." 

The order dated 16.8.2018 was assailed before this Court in CWP 

1964/2018, which was disposed of in following terms vide order dated 

28.8.2018: 

"In this background, we clarify that the appointments to the posts of 
Junior Office Assistant (Code 556) shall be strictly in accordance 
with the Common Recruitment & Promotion Rules for the posts of 
Junior Office Assistant (Information Technology), Class-III (Non-
gazetted) in various Departments of Himachal Pradesh Government, 
as also Advertisement No. 32-3/2016 and not in terms of 
communication, dated 19 th March, 2018." 

Thus, the respondents were directed to make recruitments for JOA 556 

strictly as per R&P Rules.

24.2 A review of judgment dated 28.8.2018 of this Court in CWP 

1964/2018 was sought by those candidates who supported the 

communication dated 9.3.2018 of the State Government. Review Petition 

82 of 2018 was decided in following terms on 5.11.2018: 

"5. Be that as it may, as the matter is sub-judice before the learned 
Tribunal and the Committee which has submitted its report on 
21.08.2017, has been so constituted by the learned Tribunal, its 
recommendations, can be looked into by the learned Tribunal 
uninfluenced by any observations made by this Court in the 
perspective of the Common Recruitment & Promotion Rues, in the 
backdrop of the controversy involved in the application before it." 

The effect of judgment dated 16.8.2018 in CWP 1964/2018 was diluted 

and the matters were left open to be decided by the Tribunal. 

24.3 Another Original Application No. 7397 of 2018 titled Naresh 

Kumar and others came up for hearing before the Tribunal on the ground 

that candidates with higher qualification could not be considered for 

selection as settled by Supreme Court in Zahoor Ahmed Rather Vs 

Sheikh Imtiaz Ahmed [ (2019) 2 SCC 404 ] and an order dated 

21.12.2018 came to be passed by the Tribunal directing HPSSC to make 

selections against post code 556 strictly as per Common R&P Rules and 

also in consonance with decision of Supreme Court in Zahoor Ahmed 

Rather (Supra). This order became subject matter of challenge in CWP 

161 of 2019 titled Bhupinder Sharma Vs State of H.P. and others before 

this Court. An interim order dated 11.1.2019 was passed in CWP 161 of 

2019 to the following effect: 

"Meanwhile, the operation of impugned order dated 21.12.2018 
(Annexure P-7), passed by Himachal Pradesh Administrative 
Tribunal, in O.A. No. 7397 of 2018, shall remain stayed. However, 
the Staff Selection Commission shall only allow the eligible 
candidates to participate in the process.

24.4. On 23.2.2019 HPSSC declared result of post code 556. Total 596 

candidates were selected taking into consideration the R&P Rules and 

remaining 2400 candidates were rejected. Aggrieved against their ouster 

from selection process, many rejected candidates approached The Tribunal. 

On 26.2.2019 the Tribunal directed status quo to be maintained with 

regard to issue of appointment letters in pursuance to declaration of result 

of post code 556 by HPSSC in OA No. 677/2019 (CWPOA 20 of 2019). 

Aggrieved against order dated 26.2.2019 passed by the Tribunal a group 

of selected candidates approached this Court by filing CWP 629 of 2019. 

24.5. Certain candidates whose applications were rejected by the HPSSC 

on the ground that they had not acquired the technical qualification from a 

recognised institute filed application in CWP 161/2019 as interveners. On 

21.5.2019 Division Bench of this Court passed an interim order in CWP 

161/2019 in following terms: 

"In some of the matters, which have been adjourned for 17.6.2019, 

learned Advocate General has sought time for constitution of 

committee to examine equivalence of academic/technical 

qualification. Let the said committee comprising of 3 to 5 experts be 

constituted within two weeks, which will examine all the issues 

regarding recognition and genuineness of the qualifications, which 

are claimed to be equivalent or higher than those prescribed under 

the Recruitment and Promotion Rules. The question whether 

equivalent qualification will be eligible for the advertised post is 

kept open to be decided at the appropriate stage. Meanwhile, it 

shall be discretion of the State Government to offer appointment to 

the selected candidates strictly in order of merit on contract basis 

(and not against regular posts) provided such candidates are 

possessing qualification strictly as per R&P Rules. These

appointments will be a stop gap arrangement and subject to 

outcome of these writ petitions" 

24.6. The committee appointed by the Government vide proceedings 

dated 15.6.2019 considered three issues and made its recommendations in 

following terms: 

(i) 
Equivalence of the academic/ technical qualifications prescribed 

under the Recruitment and Promotion Rules for the post of Junior Office 

Assistant (IT) 

Recommendation 

Thus, keeping in view the facts and circumstances narrated as above the 

committee unanimously concluded that no equivalent qualification can be 

considered/ recommended in the absence of specific clause to this effect in 

the R&P Rules. 

(ii) 
Recognition of the institutions imparting trainings and running 

courses in computer/ IT related subjects; 

Recommendation 

Thus, keeping above in view, the committee agreed that only qualification 

obtained from recognised institute be considered for recruitment for 

JOA(IT) and ZONE OF CONSIDERATION/ selection cannot be expanded 

after start of selection process. 

(iii) 
Higher qualification vis-à-vis the minimum essential qualifications 

prescribed under the Recruitment and Promotion Rules for the post. 

Recommendation 

Hence, the committee was in consensus that the candidates with higher 

qualification cannot be considered for appointment to the post of JOA(IT) 

under the existing R&P Rules. 

24.7. A division bench of this Court decided CWP 161/2019 and 629 

/2019 by a common judgment dated 29.08.2019. So far as the claim of the 

candidates with higher qualifications is concerned, the same was declined

i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

126 

on merits, however, the claim of candidates having qualified from 

institutes not considered recognized by State/ HPSSC was left open. The 

HPSSC while declaring the result of post Code 556 had declared only 

those candidates successful who fulfilled the prescribed essential 

qualifications as per R&P Rules. On 17.09.219, HPSSC declared the 

revised result. Thus, in pursuance to the selection process for post Code 

556 only those candidates were selected who strictly held the 

qualifications as per Advertisement and R&P Rules. 

25. 
On 20.08.2019, amendment was proposed in 2014 Rules. The 

candidates holding the equivalent qualifications for post Code 556 

approached this Court by way of CWP No. 2246 of 2019, in which interim 

direction was issued vide order dated 11.09.2019 in the following terms: -

"In the interim, the appointments, if any, of the selected candidate(s) 

against the post of J.O.A(IT) post code-556, shall be subject to the 

order to be passed in the application on the next date of hearing 

after taking on record the version of the respondents." 

26. 
On 06.12.2019, the State Government directed the HPSSC to treat 

the recruitment process for post Code 556 concluded with directions to re-

advertise/filled the unfilled and new posts after Notifications/Publication 

of new common R&P Rules, which were said to be under active 

consideration of the Department of Personnel. The writ petitions were 

filed with the reliefs identical to CWP No. 2246/2019. On 15.10.2020, a 

Division Bench of this Court in a bunch of matters lead case being CWP 

No. 2246 of 2019, again reiterated that the selections made pursuant to the 

Notification in issue would remain subject to outcome of these petitions.

The R&P Rules were finally amended and fresh Advertisement for the 

post of JOA(IT) was issued against post Code 817 on 21.09.2020. On 

15.10.2020 in bunch matters referred to hereinabove, the following order 

was passed by this Court:-

"Pursuant to Advertisement No.36-2/2020, dated 21.09.2020, issued by 

respondent-HPSSC, to the posts of Junior Office Assistant (IT), the 

respondent-H.P. Staff Selection Commission, Hamirpur, is permitted to 

proceed with the recruitment process, however, the final result shall not 

be announced without permission of this Court. Application stands 

disposed of." 

27. 
The HPSSC declared the result of Written Objective Type 

Screening Test against post Code 817 and provisionally shortlisted total 

19024 candidates for typing skilled test. 

28. 
Thus, three successive Advertisements were issued by the HPSSC 

for recruitment to the post of JOA(IT) but as the irony would have been, 

none of the selection processes have attained finality. There is challenge 

to the final selection made in post Code 447 by those who held the 

qualifications strictly in terms of R&P Rules. Challenge to selection 

process for post Code 447 is also there by the candidates who claimed 

equivalent qualifications as per R&P Rules but remained unsuccessful. 

The selection process against post Code 556 had also been challenged by 

those who either held higher or equivalent qualifications or qualifications 

from institutes considered not recgnised. As regards the persons with 

higher qualifications probably their fate stands sealed by the judgment 

passed by a Division Bench of this Court in CWP No. 161 of 2019, but all 

other challenges were still alive.

29. 
As regards the selection process for JOA 447, we already have 

held the decision of State Government dated 21.8.2017 and 18.9.2017 as 

also the selections/appointments made in pursuance thereto as legal and 

valid. Now the next question which remains to be decided relates to the 

selection process undertaken by the HPSSC for JOA 556 and the conduct 

of respondents-State in respect thereof. As noticed above, the 

advertisement for the Post Code 556 for 1156 posts was issued by the 

HPSSC on 18.10.2016. Total 85 posts out of advertised posts were to be 

filled on regular basis and rest on contract basis. The prescribed minimum 

essential qualification was again as per R & P Rules and, therefore, in the 

same language as in the case of Post Code 447. Despite the 

communication of the State Government to HPSSC dated 19.3.2018 to 

adopt the same procedure in selection process as was adopted in selection 

process of Post Code 447 in pursuance to the Government decision dated 

21.8.2017 read with 8.9.2017, the selections and appointments were made 

by applying the 2014 Rules strictly. Thus, the allowance given to 

candidates in selection process of Post Code 447 was withdrawn in 

selection process of Post Code 556. The reason, as appears from the 

record, was various interim orders passed by Tribunal/Courts from time to 

time and also the constitution of another Equivalence Committee by the 

State Government, which had recommended to apply the 2014 Rules 

strictly without deviation. Noticeably, out of 1156 advertised posts only 

596 candidates were declared qualified, selected and appointed.

30. 
Evidently, the reason for constitution of another equivalence 

committee was an interim order passed on 21.5.2019 by a Division Bench 

of this Court in CWP No. 161 of 2019. The second Equivalence 

Committee had given its recommendations on 15.6.2019. 

31. 
The question that arises for determination is whether the 

application of different set of rules contemporaneously for the same post 

by the respondents is justified? The only defence the respondents are 

relying is an interim order passed by Division Bench of this Court on 

21.5.2019 in CWP No. 161 of 2019 and the consequent constitution of 

second equivalence committee. The perusal of aforesaid order, however, 

reveals that there was no direction from this Court as such for appointment 

of equivalence committee. It was specifically noticed that the learned 

Advocate General had sought time for constitution of Committee to 

examine equivalence of academic/technical qualification. It was in this 

context that this Court ordered for appointment of an equivalence 

committee required to examine all issues regarding recognition and 

genuineness of the qualifications which were claimed to be equivalent or 

higher than those prescribed under the R & P Rules. It is worth noticing 

that vide same order the question whether equivalent qualification will be 

eligible for the advertised post was kept open to be decided at the 

appropriate stage. In this view of the matter, the respondents cannot be 

allowed to take shelter of aforesaid order dated 21.5.2019 passed in CWP 

No. 161 of 2019 and especially when even while disposing of the said writ

o u r t o f H

petition finally this Court had left the question of equivalence and 

recognition institutes open. 

32. 
There is nothing on record to suggest that the State Government 

having once issued communication dated 19.3.2018 had ever issued any 

correspondence subsequently to withdraw the directions issued to HPSSC. 

In absence of such an exercise, it is not understandable as to on what basis 

the HPSSC declared the result by considering the qualifications strictly as 

per the R & P Rules. Probably, this had resulted in view of interim orders 

passed in different applications/petitions filed before the Tribunals/Courts. 

Be that as it may be, the question as posed above is still alive. The mere 

fact that second equivalence committee was constituted and it had 

recommended to apply the 2014 Rules strictly cannot be held sufficient 

reason for the respondents to ignore their earlier decision dated 21.8.2017 

made applicable to Post Code 556 vide communication dated 19.3.2018. 

Indisputably, these decisions were neither withdrawn nor nullified by any 

subsequent act of the State Government. Once the State Government had 

exercised its power to relax the R & P Rules, there had to be a conscious 

decision again of the State Government to revert back to the original 

position, which is clearly missing in the instant case. There is nothing on 

record to suggest that the recommendations made by second equivalence 

committee were even considered by the Government/ employer much less 

accepted at any stage. That being so, the recommendations of second 

equivalence committee cannot by themselves have the effect of nullifying 

the decision dated 21.8.2017/9.3.2017 made applicable to Post Code 556

vide communication dated 19.3.2018. Thus, the denial of the right to all 

persons similarly situated to those, who were considered for selection in 

Post Code 447 from outside the purview of 2014 Rules is clearly arbitrary 

and needs to be interfered with. 

33. 
Thus, the HPSSC is directed to re-cast the merit list for JOA 556 

by including all categories of candidate as was done for JOA 447 on the 

basis of decision of Government dated 21.8.2017/18.9.2017 and further 

made applicable to JOA 556 vide communication 19.3.2018 except the 

candidates with higher qualification, who have already been held ineligible 

vide judgment dated 29.8.2019 of a Division Bench of this Court in CWP 

161/2019. These selections for JOA 556 shall be made by taking into 

account the entire number of vacancies advertised for JOA 556 and the 

decision of the Government/HPSSC to close the selection procedure for 

JOA 556 is set aside and quashed. 

34. 
Since the Common R&P Rules stand amended by 2020 Rules and 

the cause of persistent confusion for the time being appears to have been 

removed, as a necessary consequence selection for JOA 817 shall take 

place in accordance with 2020 Rules, however, the selection process shall 

not include the selection for posts which were left over from advertised 

posts of JOA 556 as the said posts have already been directed to be filled
