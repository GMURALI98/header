The Controversy: 

1. 
All the above cases are being disposed of by this common judgment. The 

issue which arises for consideration before us, in the present bunch of cases, 

1 


Page 2 

pertains to the constitutional validity of the National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005 

(hereinafter referred to as, the NTT Act). Simultaneously, the constitutional 

validity of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 has been 

assailed, by asserting, that the same violates the basic structure of the 

Constitution of India (hereinafter referred to as, the Constitution), by impinging on 

the power of "judicial review" vested in the High Court. In the event of this Court 

not acceding to the aforementioned prayers, a challenge in the alternative, has 

been raised to various provisions of the NTT Act, which has led to the 

constitution of the National Tax Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as, the NTT). 

The NTT, according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, is styled as a 

quasi-judicial appellate tribunal. 
It has been vested with the power of 

adjudicating appeals arising from orders passed by Appellate Tribunals 

(constituted under the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act, 1962, and the Central 

Excise Act, 1944). Hitherto before, the instant jurisdiction was vested with High 

Courts. The pointed issue canvassed in this behalf is, that High Courts which 

discharge judicial functions, cannot be substituted by an extra-judicial body. 

Additionally, it is maintained that the NTT in the manner of its constitution 

undermines a process of independence and fairness, which are sine qua non of 

an adjudicatory authority. 

The Historical Perspective: 

The Income Tax Legislation, in India: 

2(i). Law relating to income tax dates back to 1860, when legislation pertaining 

to levy of tax on income, was introduced in India for the first time. The original 

2 


Page 3 

enactment was replaced by subsequent legislations, enacted in 1865, 1886, 

1918 and 1922. The Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as, the 

1922 Act) was brought about, as a result of the recommendations of the All India 

Tax Committee. The 1922 Act can be described as a milestone in the evolution 

of direct tax laws in India. Detailed reference needs to be made to the provisions 

of the 1922 Act. 

(ii) 
After the procedure provided for assessment of tax had run its course, and 

tax had been assessed, an executive-appellate remedy was provided for, before 

the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (under Section 30 of the 

1922 Act). A further quasi-judicial appellate remedy, from decisions rendered by 

the first appellate authority, lay before an appellate tribunal (hereinafter referred 

to as the Appellate Tribunal). Section 33A was inserted by the Indian Income 

Tax (Amendment) Act, 1941. It provided for a remedy by way of revision before 

a Commissioner of Income Tax. 

(iii) The remedy before the Appellate Tribunal (provided under Section 5A of 

the 1922 Act, by Section 85 of the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1939), 

was required to be exercised by a bench comprising of one Judicial Member and 

one Accountant Member. It was permissible for the President of the Appellate 

Tribunal or any other Member thereof, to dispose of appeals, sitting singly 

(subject to the condition, that the total income of the assessee, as computed by 

the assessing officer, did not exceed Rs.15,000/-). It was also open to the 

President of the Appellate Tribunal to constitute larger benches of three 

3 


Page 4 

Members (subject to the condition, that the larger bench would comprise of at 

least one Judicial Member and one Accountant Member). 

(iv) Section 5A of the 1922 Act, laid down the conditions of eligibility for 

appointment as a Judicial Member -a person who had served on a civil judicial 

post for 10 years was eligible, additionally an Advocate who had been practicing 

before a High Court for a period of 10 years, was also eligible. Under the 1922 

Act, a person who had practiced in accountancy as a Chartered Accountant 

(under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949) for a period of 10 years, or was a 

Registered Accountant (or partly a Registered Accountant, and partly a 

Chartered Accountant) for a period of 10 years (under any law formerly 

enforced), was eligible for appointment as an Accountant Member. Only a 

Judicial Member could be appointed as the President of the Appellate Tribunal. 

(v) 
Section 67 of the 1922 Act, barred suits in civil courts pertaining to income 

tax related issues. Additionally, any prosecution suit or other proceedings could 

not be filed, against an officer of the Government, for an act or omission, in 

furtherance of anything done in good faith or intended to be done under the 1922 

Act. 

(vi) The 1922 Act, did not provide for an appellate remedy, before the 

jurisdictional High Court. The only involvement of the jurisdictional High Court, 

was under Section 66 of the 1922 Act. Under Section 66, either the assessee or 

the Commissioner of Income Tax, could move an application to the Appellate 

Tribunal, requiring it to refer a question of law (arising out of an assessment 

order) to the jurisdictional High Court. In case of refusal to make such a 

4 


Page 5 

reference, the aggrieved assessee or the Commissioner of Income Tax, could 

assail the refusal by the Appellate Tribunal, before the jurisdictional High Court. 

A case referred to the High Court under Section 66, was to be heard by a bench 

of not less than two judges of the High Court (Section 66A of the 1922 Act -

inserted by the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1926). Section 66 of the 

1922 Act, was amended by the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1939, 

whereby the power to make a reference became determinable by the 

Commissioner of Income Tax (in place of the Appellate Tribunal). 

(vii) In exercise of the reference jurisdiction, a question of law, which had 

arisen in an appeal pending before the Appellate Tribunal, had to be determined 

by the High Court. After the jurisdictional High Court had answered the 

reference, the Appellate Tribunal would dispose of the pending appeal in 

consonance with the legal position declared by the High Court. 

3(i) The 1922 Act was repealed by the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter 

referred to as, the Income Tax Act). As in the repealed enactment, so also under 

the Income Tax Act, an order passed by an assessing officer, was assailable 

through an executive-appellate remedy. The instant appellate remedy, was 

vested with the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals)/Commissioner (Appeals). The 

orders appealable before the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals) were distinctly 

mentioned (in Section 246 of the Income Tax Act). Likewise, the orders 

appealable before the Commissioner (Appeals) were expressly enumerated (in 

Section 246A of the Income Tax Act). 

5 


Page 6 

(ii) 
As against the order passed by the executive-appellate authority, a further 

appellate remedy was provided before a quasi-judicial appellate tribunal 

(hereinafter referred to as, the Appellate Tribunal, under Section 252 of the 

Income Tax Act). Section 255(6) of the Income Tax Act provides as under:-

"6. 
The Appellate Tribunal shall, for the purpose of discharging its 
functions, have all the powers which are vested in the income-tax 
authorities referred to in section 131, and any proceeding before the 
Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the 
meaning of sections 193 and 228 and for the purpose of section 196 of the 
Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), and the Appellate Tribunal shall be 
deemed to be a civil court for all the purposes of section 195 and Chapter 
XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (5 of 1898)." 

By a deeming fiction of law, therefore, the Appellate Tribunal was considered as 

a civil court , dealing with "judicial proceedings". 

(iii) To be eligible for appointment as the President of the ITAT, the incumbent 

had to be a sitting or retired judge of a High Court, with not less than 7 years of 

service as a judge. Alternatively, the Central Government could appoint a Senior 

Vice President or a Vice President of the Appellate Tribunal, as its President. It 

is, therefore apparent, that the Appellate Tribunal was to be comprised of a 

President, Senior Vice President(s), Vice President(s) and Members. 

(iv) The benches of the Appellate Tribunal, under the Income Tax Act (was 

similar to the one under the 1922 Act), were to be comprised of at least one 

Judicial Member and one Accountant Member. The authority to constitute 

benches of the Appellate Tribunal was vested with the President. The 

composition of the benches under the Income Tax Act, was similar to that 

postulated under the 1922 Act. When authorized by the Central Government, it 

6 


Page 7 

was open to the Appellate Tribunal, to dispose of appeals sitting singly (subject 

to the condition, that the appeal pertained to a dispute, wherein the concerned 

assessee's total income was assessed as not exceeding Rs.5 lakhs). The 

President of the Appellate Tribunal, had the authority to constitute special 

benches, comprising of three or more Members (one of whom had to be a 

Judicial Member, and one, an Accountant Member). In case of difference of 

opinion, the matter was deemed to have been decided in terms of the opinion 

expressed by the majority. 

(v) 
An assessee or the Commissioner, could move an application before the 

Appellate Tribunal, under Section 256 of the Income Tax Act, requiring it to make 

a reference to the High Court on a question of law (arising in an appeal pending 

before the Appellate Tribunal). In case the prayer made in the application was 

declined by the Appellate Tribunal, the order (declining the prayer) was 

assailable before the High Court. 

(vi) Section 257 of the Income Tax Act provided for a reference directly to the 

Supreme Court. The instant reference could be made by the Appellate Tribunal, 

if it was of the opinion, that the question of law which had arisen before it, had 

been interpreted differently, by two or more jurisdictional High Courts. 

(vii) Section 260A was inserted in the Income Tax Act by the Finance (No. 2) 

Act, 1998, with effect from 1.10.1998. Under Section 260A, an appellate remedy 

was provided for, to raise a challenge to orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal. 

The instant appellate remedy, would lie before the jurisdictional High Court. In 

terms of the mandate contained in Section 260B of the Income Tax Act, an 

7 


Page 8 

appeal before the High Court was to be heard by a bench of not less than two 

judges. The opinion of the majority, would constitute the decision of the High 

Court. Where there was no majority, on the point(s) of difference, the opinion of 

one or more judges of the High Court, was to be sought. Thereupon, the majority 

opinion of the judges (including the judges who had originally heard the case) 

would constitute the decision of the High Court. 

(viii) A further appellate remedy was available as against a decision rendered 

by the jurisdictional High Court. The instant appellate remedy was vested with 

the Supreme Court under Section 261 of the Income Tax Act. 

The Customs Legislation, in India: 

4(i). The Customs Act, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as, the Customs Act) was 

enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to customs. The Customs Act 

vested the power of assessment of customs duty, with the Deputy Collector of 

Customs or the Collector of Customs. An executive-appellate remedy was 

provided under Section 128 of the Customs Act, before a Collector of Customs 

(where the impugned order had been passed by an officer, lower in rank to the 

Collector of Customs), and before the Central Board of Excise and Customs 

(constituted under the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963), where the 

impugned order had been passed by a Collector of Customs. The Board had 

also been conferred with executive revisional powers (under Section 130 of the 

Customs Act), to suo moto, or on an application of an aggrieved person, examine 

the record of any proceeding, pertaining to a decision or order under the 

provisions of the Customs Act. Revisional powers, besides those expressly 

8 


Page 9 

vested in the Board (under Section 130 of the Customs Act), were also vested 

with the Central Government (under Section 131 of the Customs Act). 

(ii) 
By the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1980, Sections 128 to 131 of the original Act 

were substituted. The power to entertain the first executive-appellate remedy, 

was now vested with the Collector (Appeals), under Sections 128 and 128A of 

the Customs Act. On exhaustion of the above remedy, a further quasi-judicial 

appellate remedy was provided for, under Sections 129 and 129A before the 

Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to 

as, the CEGAT/Appellate Tribunal). CEGAT was also the appellate authority, 

against orders passed by the Board. With introduction of Service Tax, under 

Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994, CEGAT was conferred the jurisdiction to 

hear appeals in cases pertaining to service tax disputes as well. The Appellate 

Tribunal is now known as the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate 

Tribunal -the CESTAT. By Act 22 of 2003, the expression "Gold (Control)" was 

substituted with "Service Tax" in the definition of the "Appellate Tribunal" (w.e.f. 

14.5.2003). 

(iii) Section 129 of the Customs Act delineated the constitution of the CEGAT. 

It was to comprise of as many Judicial and Technical Members, as the Central 

Government thought fit. The instant provision, also laid down the conditions of 

eligibility for appointment of Judicial/Technical Members. A Judicial Member 

could be chosen out of persons, who had held a civil judicial post for at least 10 

years, or out of persons who had been in practice as an Advocate for at least 10 

years, as also, from out of Members of the Central Legal Service (not below 

9 


Page 10 

Grade-I), who had held such post for at least 3 years. A Technical Member could 

be appointed out of persons, who had been members of the Indian Customs and 

Central Excise Service (Group A), subject to the condition, that such persons had 

held the post of Collector of Customs or Central Excise (Level I), or equivalent or 

higher post, for at least 3 years. The Finance (No.2) Act, 1996 amended Section 

129(3) of the Customs Act, whereby it enabled the Central Government to 

appoint a person to be the President of the Appellate Tribunal. The Central 

Government could make such appointment, subject to the condition, that the 

person concerned had been a judge of the High Court, or was one of the 

Members of the Appellate Tribunal. Likewise, it was open to the Central 

Government to appoint one or more Members of the Appellate Tribunal to be its 

Vice President(s). 

(iv) Powers and functions of the Appellate Tribunal were to be exercised 

through benches constituted by its President, from amongst Members of the 

Appellate Tribunal (in terms of Section 129C of the Customs Act). Each bench 

was required to be comprised of at least one Judicial Member and one Technical 

Member. It was open to the President to constitute a special bench of not less 

than three Members (comprising of at least one Judicial and one Technical 

Member). The composition of the bench, was modified by an amendment which 

provided, that a special bench of the Appellate Tribunal was to consist of not less 

than two Members (instead of three). It was also open to the President and/or 

Members (as authorized by the President of the Appellate Tribunal) to dispose of 

appeals, sitting singly, subject to the condition, that the value of goods 

10 


Page 11 

confiscated, or the difference in duty involved, or duty involved, or the amount of 

fine or penalty involved, did not exceed Rs.10,000/---the limit was first revised to 

Rs.50,000/-, then to Rs.1 lakh, later to Rs.10 lakhs, and at present, the same is 

Rs.50 lakhs. A case involving a dispute where the determination of any question 

having a relation to the rate of duty of customs or to the value of goods for 

purposes of assessment is the sole or one of the points in issue, must however 

be heard by a bench comprising of a Judicial and a Technical Member [Section 

129C(4)(b)]. In case of difference of opinion on any point(s), the opinion of the 

majority was to constitute the decision of the Appellate Tribunal. If Members 

were equally divided, the appeal was to be referred by the President, for hearing 

on such point(s), by one or more other Members of the Appellate Tribunal. 

Whereupon, the majority opinion was to be considered as the decision of the 

Appellate Tribunal. Sub-sections (7) and (8) of Section 129C provided as under:-

"(7) The Appellate Tribunal shall, for the purposes of discharging its 
functions, have the same powers as are vested in a court under the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), when trying a suit in respect of the 
following matters, namely:-
(a) 
discovery and inspection; 
(b) 
enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on 
oath; 
(c) 
compelling the production of books of account and other 
documents; and 
(d) 
issuing commissions. 
(8) 
Any proceeding before the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be 
a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228 and for 
the purpose of Section 196 of the Indian Penal Code 945 of 1860) and the 
Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for all the purposes 
of Section 195 and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 
(2 of 1974)." 

11 


Page 12 

It is apparent from the above provision, that by a fiction of law, proceedings 

before the Appellate Tribunal are treated as judicial proceedings. 

(v) 
The Customs and Excise Revenues Appellate Tribunal Act, 1986 came 

into force with effect from 23.12.1986. Section 26 of the instant enactment, 

excluded the jurisdiction of courts except the Supreme Court. Section 28 thereof 

provided as under:-

"28. Proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal to be judicial proceedings 
-All proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be 
judicial proceedings within the meaning of Sections 193, 219 and 228 of 
the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)." 

A perusal of the above amendment reveals, that by a fiction of law, the Appellate 

Tribunal was deemed to be discharging "judicial proceedings". Therefore, the 

position prevailing prior to the amendment, was maintained, so far as the instant 

aspect was concerned. 

(vi) Just as in the case of the 1922 Act, which did not provide for an appellate 

remedy, but allowed a reference to be made to a jurisdictional High Court, under 

Section 66, likewise, Section 130 of the Customs Act provided for a reference on 

a question of law, to the High Court. A reference could be made, on an 

application by the Collector of Customs or the person on whom customs duty has 

been levied, to the Appellate Tribunal. If the Appellate Tribunal refused to make 

a reference, the aggrieved party could assail the determination of the Appellate 

Tribunal, before the jurisdictional High Court. Where a reference on a question 

of law was entertained, it had to be heard by a bench of not less than two judges 

of the High Court. In case of difference of opinion on any point(s), the opinion 

12 


Page 13 

expressed by the majority, was to be treated as the decision of the High Court. 

Where the opinion was equally divided, on the point(s) of difference, the matter 

was to be heard by one or more other judges of the High Court. Thereupon, the 

majority opinion of the judges (including the judges who had originally heard the 

case) would constitute the decision of the High Court. A decision of the High 

Court, would then be applied by the Appellate Tribunal, for the disposal of the 

appeal wherefrom the reference had arisen. 

(vii) The Appellate Tribunal was also authorized to make a reference directly to 

the Supreme Court (under Section 130A of the Customs Act). This could be 

done, in case the Appellate Tribunal was of the view, that there was a conflict of 

decisions of High Courts in respect of a question of law pending before it for 

decision. The decision of the Supreme Court, would then be applied by the 

Appellate Tribunal, for the disposal of the appeal out of which the reference had 

arisen. 

(viii) The Finance (No. 32) Act, 2003 introduced a new Section 130. The 

remedy of a reference to the jurisdictional High Court, was substituted by a 

remedy of an appeal to the High Court. The amended Section 130 of the 

Customs Act provided, that an appeal would lie to the High Court from every 

order passed by the Appellate Tribunal (on or after 1.7.2003), subject to the 

condition, that the High Court was satisfied, that the case involved a substantial 

question of law. In such an eventuality, the High Court would formulate the 

substantial question(s) of law. It was open to the High Court in exercise of its 

instant appellate jurisdiction, also to determine any issue which had not been 

13 


Page 14 

decided by the Appellate Tribunal, or had been wrongly decided by the Appellate 

Tribunal. The appeal preferred before the High Court, could be heard by a bench 

of not less than two judges. 

(ix) After amendment to Section 130, Section 130E was also amended. The 

latter amended provision, provided for an appeal to the Supreme Court, from a 

judgment of the High Court, delivered on an appeal filed under Section 130, or on 

a reference made under Section 130 by the Appellate Tribunal (before 1.7.2003), 

or on a reference made under Section 130A. 

(x) 
The NTT Act omitted Sections 130, 130A, 130B, 130C and 130D of the 

Customs Act. The instant enactment provided for an appeal from every order 

passed by the Appellate Tribunal to the NTT, subject to the condition, that the 

NTT arrived at the satisfaction, that the case involved a substantial question of 

law. On admission of an appeal, the NTT would formulate the substantial 

question of law for hearing the appeal. Section 23 of the NTT Act provided, that 

on and from the date, to be notified by the Central Government, all matters and 

proceedings including appeals and references, pertaining to direct/indirect taxes, 

pending before the High Court, would stand transferred to the NTT. Section 24 

of the NTT Act provides for an appeal from an order passed by the NTT, directly 

to the Supreme Court. 

The Central Excise Legislation, in India: 

5(i). The Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as, the 

Excise Act) was enacted to consolidate and amend, the law related to central 

duties on excise, and goods manufactured and produced in India, and to salt. 

14 


Page 15 

Under the said enactment, the power to assess the duty, was vested with the 

Assistant Collectors of Central Excise, and Collectors of Central Excise. An 

executive-appellate remedy was provided for under Section 35 before the 

Commissioner (Appeals). 

(ii) 
The Board was vested with revisional jurisdiction. Revisional jurisdiction 

was additionally vested with the Central Government. In 1972, the Board was 

empowered under Section 35A of the Excise Act, to exercise the power of 

revision, from a decision/order/rule made/passed, under the Excise Act, subject 

to the condition, that no revision would lie under the instant provision, as against 

an appellate order passed under Section 35 of the Excise Act, by the 

Commissioner (Appeals). The Central Government was vested with revisional 

jurisdiction against appellate orders passed by the Commissioner (Appeals) 

under Section 35. In 1978, the revisional jurisdiction which hitherto before lay 

with the Board, was vested with the Collector of Central Excise. 

(iii) On the exhaustion of the first executive-appellate remedy, a further quasi-

judicial appellate remedy was provided for, under Section 35B of the Excise Act, 

to an Appellate Tribunal. The remedy of appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, 

could be availed of (a) against a decision or order passed by the Collector of 

Central Excise as an adjudicating authority, (b) against an order passed by the 

Collector (Appeals) under Section 35A of the Excise Act (as substituted by the 

Finance (No. 2) Act, 1980), (c) against an order passed by the Board or the 

Appellate Collector of Central Excise under Section 35 (as it stood before 

15 


Page 16 

21.8.1980), and (d) against an order passed by the Board or the Collector of 

Central Excise under Section 35A (as it stood before 21.8.1980). 

(iv) The Appellate Tribunal was to be comprised of such number of 

Judicial/Technical Members as the Central Government would think fit. 

Appointment of Judicial Members could only be made from amongst persons 

who had held a judicial office in India for at least 10 years, or who had been 

practicing as an Advocate for at least 10 years, or who had been a member of 

the Indian Legal Service (having held a post in Grade I of the said service, or any 

equivalent or higher post) for at least 3 years. Only such persons could be 

appointed as Technical Members who had been, members of the Indian 

Customs and Central Excise Service, Group A, and had held the post of 

Collector of Customs or Central Excise (or any equivalent or higher post) for at 

least 3 years. The Central Government had the power to appoint a person, who 

was or had been a judge of a High Court, or who was one of the Members of the 

Appellate Tribunal, as the President of the Appellate Tribunal. The functions of 

the Appellate Tribunal were to be discharged through benches constituted by its 

President. The Central Government also had the authority to appoint one or 

more Members of the Appellate Tribunal as Vice-President(s). Each bench was 

to consist of at least one Judicial Member and one Technical Member. In case of 

difference of opinion on any point(s), the opinion of the majority would constitute 

the decision of the Appellate Tribunal. If the Members of the bench were equally 

divided, the President was required to refer the disputed opinion for hearing, on 

the point(s) of difference, by one or more other Members of the Appellate 

16 


Page 17 

Tribunal. The majority opinion after such reference, would be the decision of the 

Appellate Tribunal. It was also permissible for the President, and the Members 

(authorized by the President) of the Appellate Tribunal, to hear and dispose of 

appeals, sitting singly (subject to the condition, that the difference in duty or the 

duty involved, or the amount of fine or penalty involved, did not exceed 

Rs.10,000/---the limit was first revised to Rs.50,000/-, then to Rs.1 lakh, later 

to Rs.10 lakhs, and at present, the same is Rs.50 lakhs). Similar provision (as in 

respect of appeals to the Appellate Tribunal under Customs Act) with regard to 

matters to be heard by a division bench, is enjoined in Section 35D(3)(a) of the 

Excise Act. 

(v) 
The Customs and Excise Revenues Appellate Tribunals Act, 1986, came 

into force on 23.12.1986. Section 26 of the instant enactment excluded the 

jurisdiction of courts except the Supreme Court. Section 14, provided for 

jurisdiction, powers and authority of the Appellate Tribunal. Section 28 provided 

as under:-

"28. Proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal to be judicial proceedings 
-All proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be 
judicial proceedings within the meaning of Sections 193, 219 and 228 of 
the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)." 

A perusal of the above amendment reveals, that by a fiction of law, the Appellate 

Tribunal was deemed to be discharging "judicial proceedings". 

(vi) Section 35G provided for a reference on any question of law, by the 

Appellate Tribunal, to the High Court. The aforesaid remedy could be availed of 

by filing an application before the Appellate Tribunal. Such an application could 

be filed by either the Collector of Central Excise, or the person on whom the 

17 


Page 18 

excise duty was levied. A reference, on a question of law, made by the Appellate 

Tribunal, to the High Court, would be heard by a bench of not less than two 

judges. On the Appellate Tribunal's refusal to refer a question of law, the 

aggrieved party could assail the decision of the Appellate Tribunal (declining to 

make a reference), before the High Court. The jurisdictional High Court, on the 

acceptance of a reference, would render its decision, on the question of law. In 

case of difference of opinion, the opinion expressed by the majority would 

constitute the decision of the High Court. If the opinion by the bench was equally 

divided, the point(s) of difference were to be heard by one or more other judges 

of the High Court, whereafter, the opinion expressed by the majority would be 

treated as the decision of the High Court. The Appellate Tribunal would 

thereupon, decide the pending appeal, in consonance with the decision rendered 

by the High Court. 

(vii) Section 35H of the Excise Act provided for a reference, by the Appellate 

Tribunal, directly to the Supreme Court. The instant reference by the Appellate 

Tribunal, could be made after the Appellate Tribunal had arrived at the 

conclusion, that the question of law arising for adjudication in an appeal pending 

before it, was differently interpreted by two or more jurisdictional High Courts. 

The decision of the Supreme Court, would then be applied by the Appellate 

Tribunal, to decide the pending appeal. Section 35L provided for appeal to the 

Supreme Court against the judgment rendered by the High Court (upon a 

reference made to the High Court by the Appellate Tribunal). The decision of the 

18 


Page 19 

Supreme Court would then be applied by the Appellate Tribunal, in the disposal 

of the appeal pending before it. 

(viii) The Finance (No. 32) Act, 2003 substituted Section 35G of the Excise Act 

and in place of the remedy of reference, the amended provision provided for a 

direct appeal to the jurisdictional High Court (after the cut-off date, i.e., 1.7.2003). 

The jurisdictional High Court was to entertain an appeal from an order passed by 

the Appellate Tribunal, on its being satisfied, that the appeal raised a substantial 

question of law. In such an eventuality, the High Court would formulate the 

substantial question(s) of law. It was open to the High Court in exercise of its 

instant appellate jurisdiction, also to determine any issue which had not been 

decided by the Appellate Tribunal, or had wrongly been decided by the Appellate 

Tribunal. The appeal preferred before the High Court, would be heard by a 

bench of not less than two judges. Section 35L of the Excise Act was also 

amended. The amended provision provided for an appeal from any judgment of 

the High Court (in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under Section 35G of the 

Excise Act, or on a reference made under Section 35G by the Appellate Tribunal 

before 1.7.2003, or on a reference made under Section 35H), to the Supreme 

Court. 

(ix) The NTT Act omitted Sections 35G, 35H, 35I and 35J of the Excise Act. 

The instant enactment provided for an appeal from every order passed by the 

Appellate Tribunal to the NTT, subject to the condition, that the NTT was 

satisfied, that the case involved a substantial question of law. On admission of 

an appeal, the NTT would formulate the substantial question of law, for hearing 

19 


Page 20 

the appeal. Section 23 of the NTT Act provided, that on and from the date to be 

notified by the Central Government, all matters and proceedings including 

appeals and references, pertaining to direct/indirect taxes, pending before the 

jurisdictional High Courts, would stand transferred to the NTT. Section 24 of the 

NTT Act provided for an appeal from an order passed by the NTT, to the 

Supreme Court. 

Facts leading to the promulgation of the NTT Act: 

6. 
The first Law Commission of independent India was established in 1955 

for a three year term under the chairmanship of Mr. M.C. Setalvad, who was also 

the first Attorney General for India. The idea of constituting a "National Tax 

Court" was mooted by the first Law Commission in its 12 th Report, suggesting the 

abolition of the existing appellate tribunal, under the framework of the Income 

Tax Act. It recommended a direct appeal to the High Courts, from orders passed 

by appellate Commissioners. This recommendation was not accepted. 

7. 
A Direct Taxes Enquiry Committee was set up by the Government of India 

in 1970, with Mr. K.N. Wanchoo a retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of 

India, as its Chairman. The Enquiry Committee was assigned the following 

objectives: (1) to recommend ways to check avoidance of tax, through various 

legal lacunae; (2) to examine the exemptions allowed by tax laws, and evaluate 

scope of their reduction; and (3) to suggest methods for better tax assessment, 

and improvements in tax administration. 
The Wanchoo Committee 

recommended creation of a "National Court", which would be comprised of 

20 


Page 21 

judges with special knowledge of tax laws. The recommendation made by the 

Wanchoo Committee, was for creation of permanent "Tax Benches" in High 

Courts, and appointment of retired judges to such benches, under Article 224A of 

the Constitution. The suggestion was aimed at clearing the backlog of tax cases. 

The Wanchoo Committee did not suggest the establishment of any separate tax 

courts as that, according to the Committee, would involve an amendment to the 

provisions of the Constitution, besides other statutory and procedural changes. 

8. 
Another Direct Tax Laws Committee was constituted in 1977, under the 

chairmanship of Mr. N.K. Palkhivala, an eminent jurist. The Committee was later 

headed by Mr. G.C. Choksi. The Committee was constituted, to examine and 

suggest legal and administrative measures, for simplification and rationalization 

of direct tax laws. The Choksi Committee recommended the establishment of a 

"Central Tax Court" with an all-India jurisdiction. It was suggested, that such a 

court be constituted under a separate statute. Just like the recommendations of 

the Wanchoo Committee, the recommendations of the Choksi Committee also 

necessitated amendments in the provisions of the Constitution. As an interim 

measure to the above recommendation, the Choksi Committee suggested, the 

desirability of constituting "Special Tax Benches" in High Courts, to deal with the 

large number of pending tax cases, by continuous sitting throughout the year. It 

was also suggested, that judges who sit on the "Special Tax Benches", should be 

selected from those who had special knowledge, to deal with matters relating to 

direct tax laws. The Choksi Committee recommended, that the judges selected 

for the "Special Tax Benches" would be transferred to the "Central Tax Court", as 

21 


Page 22 

and when the same was constituted. It is, therefore apparent, that according to 

the recommendations of the Choksi Committee, the "Central Tax Court" was to 

comprise of judges of High Courts, or persons qualified to be appointed as High 

Court Judges. The recommendations of the Choksi Committee reveal, that the 

suggested "Central Tax Court" would be a special kind of High Court, to deal with 

issues pertaining to direct tax laws. This was sought to be clarified in paragraph 

6.22 of the Choksi Committee's Report. 

9. 
None of the recommendations referred to hereinabove were implemented, 

till a similar recommendation was again mooted in the early 1990s. After 

deliberating on the issue for a few years, the Union of India promulgated the 

National Tax Tribunal Ordinance, 2003. The Ordinance inter alia provided, for 

the transfer of appellate jurisdiction (under direct tax laws) vested in High Courts, 

to the NTT. After the Ordinance lapsed, the National Tax Tribunal Bill, 2004 was 

introduced. The said Bill was referred to a Select Committee of the Parliament. 

The Select Committee granted a personal hearing to a variety of stakeholders, 

including the representatives of the Madras Bar Association (i.e., the petitioner 

before this Court in Transferred Case (C) no. 150 of 2006). The Committee 

presented its report on 2.8.2005. In its report, it suggested serious reservations 

on the setting up of the NTT. The above Bill was presented before the Lok 

Sabha in 2005. The Bill expressed four main reasons for setting up the NTT: (1) 

to reduce pendency of huge arrears, that had mounted in High Courts all over the 

country, (2) huge tax recovery was statedly held up, in tax litigation before 

various High Courts, which directly impacted implementation of national 

22 


Page 23 

projects/welfare schemes of the Government of India, (3) to have a uniformity in 

the interpretation of tax laws. In this behalf it was suggested, that different 

opinions were expressed by different High Courts on identical tax issues, 

resulting in the litigation process being tied up in higher Courts, and (4) the 

existing judges dealing with tax cases, were from civil courts, and therefore, were 

not well-versed to decide complicated tax issues. 

The issues canvassed on behalf of the petitioners: 

10. The submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, for purposes of 

convenience, deserve to be examined from a series of distinct and separate 

perspectives. Each perspective is truly an independent submission. It is, 

therefore necessary, in the first instance, to clearly describe the different 

submissions, advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners. 

The same are accordingly being delineated hereunder:-

The first contention: 
That the reasons for setting up the NTT, were fallacious 

and non-existent. Since the foundational basis is untrue, the structure erected 

thereupon, cannot be accepted as valid and justified. And therefore, the same is 

liable to be struck down. 

The second contention: It is impermissible for the legislature to abrogate/divest 

the core judicial appellate functions, specially the functions traditionally vested 

with the High Court. Furthermore, the transfer of such functions to a quasi-

judicial authority, devoid of essential ingredients of the superior court, sought to 

be replaced was constitutionally impermissible, and was liable to be set aside. 

Besides the appellate jurisdiction, the power of judicial review vested in High 

23 


Page 24 

Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, has also been negated by 

the NTT Act. And therefore, the same be set aside. 

The third contention: Separation of powers, the rule of law, and judicial review, 

constitute amongst others, the basic structure of the Constitution. Article 323B 

inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, to the extent it 

is violative of the above mentioned components of the basic structure of the 

Constitution, is liable to be declared ultra vires the Constitution. 

The fourth contention: A number of provisions including Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 

13 of the NTT Act, undermine the independence of the adjudicatory process 

vested in the NTT, and as such, are liable to be set aside in their present format. 

11. We shall now narrate each of the above contentions advanced by the 

learned counsel for the petitioners, in the manner submissions were advanced 

before us. 

The first contention: 

12. As regards arrears of tax related cases before High Courts is concerned, it 

was submitted, that the figures indicated by the Department were incorrect. In 

this behalf it was asserted, that the stance adopted at the behest of the Revenue, 

that there were about 80,000 cases pending in different courts, was untrue. It 

was the emphatic contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that as of 

October, 2003 (when the National Tax Tribunal Ordinance, was promulgated), 

the arrears were approximately 29,000. Of the total pendency, a substantial 

number was only before a few High Courts, including the High Court of Bombay 

and the High Court of Delhi. In the petition filed by the Madras Bar Association, it 

24 


Page 25 

was asserted, that in the Madras High Court, the pending appeals under Section 

260A of the Income Tax Act, were less than 2,000. It was also sought to be 

asserted, that the pendency of similar appeals in most southern States was even 

lesser. It was pointed out, that the pendency of such appeals in the High Court 

of Karnataka and the High Court of Kerala, was even lesser than 2,000. 

13. In respect of the Revenue's assertion, that huge tax recovery was held up, 

in tax litigation, before High Courts, it was submitted, that the figures projected at 

the behest of the Department were incorrect. It was pointed out, that according 

to the Revenue, the pending cases in the High Courts involved an amount of 

approximately Rs.80,000 crores (relatable to direct tax cases). It was submitted, 

that the figures projected by the Department, included not only the basic tax, but 

interest and penalty imposed thereon, as well. It was pointed out, that interest 

could be as high as 40% per annum, under tax statutes, besides penal interest. 

It was accordingly sought to be canvassed, that if the main appeals were set 

aside by the High Court, there would hardly be any dues payable to the 

Government at all. Additionally, it was sought to be asserted, that many tax 

appeals pending before the High Courts, were filed by assessees, and 

accordingly, in the event of the assessees succeeding, the amount could not be 

considered as having been held up, but may have to be refunded. It was further 

asserted, that in most cases, the Revenue was able to recover a substantial 

amount from the assessees, by the time the matter reached the High Court (on 

account of pre-deposits). It was, therefore sought to be submitted, that the 

25 


Page 26 

figures indicated by the Revenue, with reference to the amount of tax held up in 

pending cases, before High Courts was wholly flawed and deceptive. 

14. It was also the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that 

the mere establishment and creation of the NTT, would not result in uniformity of 

decisions pertaining to tax laws. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that 

just as in the manner two High Courts could differ with one another, so also, 

could two tax benches, of the NTT. On the factual front, it was pointed out, that 

divergence of opinion in High Courts was very rare. It was, as a matter of 

approximation, suggested, that in most cases (approximately 99%), one High 

Court would follow the view taken by another High Court. Learned counsel, 

however pointed out, that in High Courts an age-old mechanism, to resolve 

conflicts of views, by either placing such matters before larger benches, or before 

a higher court, was in place. Pointing out illustratively to the ITAT and the 

CESTAT, it was asserted, that there had been many cases of divergence of 

opinion, which were resolved by larger benches. It was, therefore sought to be 

canvassed, that the instant basis for constituting the NTT, was also not based on 

a prudent or sensible rationale. 

15. On the subject of High Court Judges being not well-versed to determine 

complicated interpretation of tax-law related issues, it was submitted, that the 

very mention of the above as a basis, for creating the NTT, was extremely 

unfortunate. It was submitted, that well before the independence of this country, 

and even thereafter, High Courts have been interpreting and construing tax 

related disputes, in a legitimate, tenable and lawful manner. The fairness and 

26 


Page 27 

rationale of tax related issues, according to learned counsel, was apparent from 

the faith reposed in High Courts both by the Revenue, as well as, by the 

assessees. Furthermore, the veracity and truthfulness, of the instant assertion, 

according to the learned counsel, could be gauged from the fact, that 

interference by the Supreme Court, in the orders passed by the High Courts on 

tax matters, has been minimal. 

16. During the course of hearing, our attention was also invited to the fact, that 

the legislations of the instant nature would have a lopsided effect. In this behalf it 

was sought to be pointed out, that while jurisdiction vested in High Courts was 

being excluded, the burden was being transferred to the Supreme Court of India. 

This assertion was sought to be substantiated by the learned counsel for the 

petitioners, by inviting our attention to the legislations, wherein the power of 

judicial review traditionally vested in the High Courts, has been excluded, and a 

remedy of appeal has been provided from the tribunals constituted directly to the 

Supreme Court. In this behalf, reference may illustratively be made to the 

following provisions:-

(i) 
The Electricity Act, 2003 
125. Appeal to Supreme Court -Any person aggrieved by any 
decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal, may, file an appeal to the 
Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of communication of 
the decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal to him, on any one or 
more of the grounds specified in Section 100 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908): 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal 
within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not 
exceeding sixty days. 
(ii) 
The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 

27 


Page 28 

Section 22. Appeal to Supreme Court -Any person aggrieved by 
any award, decision or order of the tribunal, may, file an appeal to 
the Supreme Court, within ninety days from the date of 
communication of the award, decision or order of Tribunal, to him, 
on any one or more of the grounds specified in Section 100 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, entertain any appeal after the 
expiry of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was 
prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal. 
(iii) The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 
Section 18. Appeal to Supreme Court -(1) Notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) 
or in any other law, an appeal shall lie against any order, not being 
an interlocutory order, of the Appellate Tribunal to the Supreme 
Court on one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of that 
code. 
(2) 
No appeal shall lie against any decision or order made by the 
Appellate Tribunal with the consent of the parties. 
(3) 
Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a 
period of ninety days from the date of the decision or order appealed 
against: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain the appeal after the 
expiry of the said period of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the 
appeal in time. 
(iv) The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 
Section 15Z. Appeal to Supreme Court. -Any person aggrieved by 
any decision or order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal may file an 
appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the Securities Appellate 
Tribunal to him on any question of law arising out to such order: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal 
within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not 
exceeding sixty days. 
(v) 
Companies Act, 1956 
Section 10GF. Appeal to Supreme Court. -Any person aggrieved 
by any decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal 
to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal to 
him on any question of law arising out of such decision or order: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal 
within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not 
exceeding sixty days. 

28 


Page 29 

17. It was also pointed out, that the enactment of the NTT Act per se lacks 

bonafides. In this behalf the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner 

was, that there is a Parliamentary convention that if a Select Committee rejects a 

Bill, it is normally not passed by the Parliament. At the very least, the 

reservations expressed by the Select Committee are taken into account, and the 

Bill in question is appropriately modified. It was submitted, that the bill under 

reference was presented before the Lok Sabha on 29.11.2005, and the same 

was passed without making a single amendment. 

18. It was, therefore, the vehement contention of the learned counsel for the 

petitioners, that the foundational facts being incorrect, and the manner in which 

the bill was passed, being devoid of bonafides, the legislation itself i.e., the NTT 

Act, deserved to be set aside. 

The second contention: 

19. It was the emphatic contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, 

that it was impermissible for the legislature to abrogate/divest the core judicial 

appellate functions traditionally vested with the High Court, and to confer/vest the 

same, with an independent quasi-judicial authority, which did not even have the 

basic ingredients of a superior Court, like the High Court (whose jurisdiction is 

sought to be transferred). In conjunction with the instant contention, it was also 

the submission of the learned counsel, that the jurisdiction vested in the High 

Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, is not only in respect of the 

rightful implementation of statutory provisions, but also of supervisory jurisdiction, 

over courts and tribunals, cannot be curtailed under any circumstances. 

29 


Page 30 

20. In order to supplement the instant contention, learned counsel also placed 

reliance on Article 225 of the Constitution which is being extracted hereunder:-

"225. Jurisdiction of existing High Courts -Subject to the provisions of this 
Constitution and to the provisions of any law of the appropriate Legislature 
made by virtue of powers conferred on that Legislature by this Constitution, 
the jurisdiction of, and the law administered in, any existing High Court, 
and the respective powers of the Judges thereof in relation to the 
administration of justice in the Court, including any power to make rules of 
Court and to regulate the sittings of the court and of members thereof 
sitting alone or in Division Courts, shall be the same as immediately before 
the commencement of this Constitution: 

Provided that any restriction to which the exercise of original jurisdiction by 
any of the High Courts with respect to any matter concerning the revenue 
or concerning any act ordered or done in the collection thereof was subject 
immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall no longer 
apply to the exercise of such jurisdiction." 

Inviting the Court's attention to the proviso to Article 225 of the Constitution it was 

submitted, that the original jurisdiction of High Courts on matters pertaining to 

revenue or the collection thereof, even if considered as barred, the said bar was 

ordered to be expressly done away with, by the proviso to Article 225 of the 

Constitution. In the present context, learned counsel for the petitioners invited 

our attention to Section 226(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935. The said 

Section is reproduced hereunder:-

"226(1) 
Until otherwise provided by Act of the appropriate Legislature, 
no High Court shall have any original Jurisdiction in any matter concerning 
the revenue, or concerning any act ordered or done in the collection 
thereof according to the usage and practice of the country or the law for 
the time being in force." 

It was submitted, that under the above statutory provision, a High Court could not 

issue a writ in the nature of mandamus, to call upon a Revenue authority to 

discharge its statutory obligations, in respect of the assessment of tax. Likewise, 

30 


Page 31 

it was not open to the High Court, to issue a writ in the nature of certiorari or 

certiorarified mandamus, in order to set aside or modify an order of assessment, 

passed in violation of or in contravention of any statutory provision(s). It was 

submitted, that the proviso to Article 225 of the Constitution, as has been 

extracted hereinabove, was omitted by the Constitution (Forty-second 

Amendment) Act, 1976 (with effect from 1.2.1977). It was, however pointed out, 

that the Parliament having realized its mistake, restored the proviso to Article 225 

of the Constitution, as was originally enacted by the Constitution (Forty-fourth 

Amendment) Act, 1978 (with effect from 20.6.1979). Thus viewed, according to 

the learned counsel for the petitioners, under the provisions of the Constitution, 

prevailing at the present juncture, the original jurisdiction of the High Court (i.e., 

the jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution), as also, the law 

administered by a High Court at the time of enactment of the Constitution, cannot 

be restricted. Accordingly, it was asserted, that on matters pertaining to revenue 

or the collection thereof, the adjudication authority of High Courts, could not be 

curtailed. 

21. Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, on which emphatic reliance has 

been placed by the learned counsel, are being reproduced hereunder:-

"226. Power of High Courts to issue certain writs -
(1) Notwithstanding anything in article 32, every High Court shall have 
power, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises 
jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate 
cases, any Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, 
including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo 
warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the 
rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose. 

31 


Page 32 

(2) 
The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs 
to any Government, authority or person may also be exercised by any High 
Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the 
cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, 
notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the 
residence of such person is not within those territories. 
(3) 
Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of 
injunction or stay or in any other manner, is made on, or in any 
proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1), without -
( a) 
furnishing to such party copies of such petition and all 
documents in support of the plea for such interim order; and 
(b) 
giving such party an opportunity of being heard, makes an 
application to the High Court for the vacation of such order and 
furnishes a copy of such application to the party in whose favour 
such order has been made or the counsel of such party, the High 
Court shall dispose of the application within a period of two weeks 
from the date on which it is received or from the date on which the 
copy of such application is so furnished, whichever is later, or where 
the High Court is closed on the last day of that period, before the 
expiry of the next day afterwards on which the High Court is open; 
and if the application is not so disposed of, the interim order shall, on 
the expiry of that period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the aid 
next day, stand vacated. 
(4) 
The power conferred on a High Court by this article shall not be in 
derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme Court by clause (2) of 
Article 32. 
227. Power of superintendence over all courts by the High Court -
(1) 
Every High Court shall have superintendence over all courts and 
tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises 
jurisdiction. 
(2) 
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions, the 
High Court may -
(a) 
call for returns from such courts; 
(b) 
make and issue general rules and prescribe forms for 
regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; and 
(c) 
prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts shall be 
kept by the officers of any such courts. 
(3) 
The High Court may also settle tables of fees to be allowed to the 
sheriff and all clerks and officers of such courts and to attorneys, 
advocates and pleaders practising therein: 
Provided that any rules made, forms prescribed or tables settled 
under clause (2) or clause (3) shall not be inconsistent with the provision of 
any law for the time being in force, and shall require the previous approval 
of the Governor. 

32 


Page 33 

(4) 
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to confer on a High Court 
powers of superintendence over any court or tribunal constituted by or 
under any law relating to the Armed Forces." 

It was submitted, that the above original jurisdiction vested in the High Court to 

issue prerogative writs, has been shown to have been consciously preserved, for 

matters pertaining to levy and collection of tax. It was also submitted, that the 

enactment of the NTT Act has the clear and explicit effect, of excluding the 

jurisdiction of the High Courts. This was sought to be explained by indicating, 

that the jurisdiction to adjudicate appeals, traditionally determined by 

jurisdictional High Courts, from orders passed by Appellate Tribunals under the 

Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act (all taxing legislations) have 

been taken out of the purview of the High Courts, and have been vested with the 

NTT, by the NTT Act. It was further submitted, that even the jurisdiction vested 

in High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, has been 

practically done away with. In this behalf the explanation was, that by providing 

for an appellate remedy against an order passed by the NTT, directly to the 

Supreme Court, the above original jurisdiction of the High Courts, had practically 

been frustrated and effectively neutralized. It is pointed out, that the curtailment 

of the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the 

Constitution, must be viewed as submission, distinct and separate from the one 

emerging out of the substitution of, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under 

Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, Section 130 of the Customs Act, and 

Section 35G of the Excise Act. Whilst the former contention is based on a clear 

constitutional right, the submission based on the provisions of the taxing statutes, 

33 


Page 34 

emerges from a well accepted constitutional convention, coupled with the clear 

intent expressed in the proviso to Article 225 of the Constitution. 

22. In order to support the second contention advanced by the petitioners, the 

following decisions were relied upon: 

(i) 
Reliance was first of all, placed on the decision of the Privy Council in 

Hinds v. The Queen Director of Public Prosecutions v. Jackson Attorney General 

of Jamaica (Intervener), 1976 All ER Vol. (1) 353. The factual/legal position 

which arose for determination in the cited case pertained to the Gun Court Act, 

1974, enacted by the Parliament of Jamaica. The aforesaid enactment was 

made, without following the special procedure prescribed by Section 49 of the 

Constitution of Jamaica (to alter the provisions of the Constitution of Jamaica). 

The Gun Court Act, 1974, had the effect of creating a new Court -"the Gun 

Court", to sit in three different kinds of divisions: A Resident Magistrate's Division, 

a Full Court Division and a Circuit Court Division. One or the other of these 

divisions, was conferred with the jurisdiction to try, different categories of 

offenders of criminal offences. Prior to the passing of the Act, and at the date of 

coming into force of the Constitution, these offences were cognizable only before 

a Resident Magistrate's Court, or before the Circuit Court of the Supreme Court 

of Jamaica. The Gun Court Act, 1974, also laid down the procedure to be 

followed (in each of the divisions). For certain specified offences relating to 

unauthorized possession, acquisition or disposal of firearms and ammunition, 

"the Gun Court" was required to mandatorily impose a sentence of detention on 

hard labour. A detenue could only be discharged, at the direction of the 

34 


Page 35 

Governor-General, acting in accordance with the advice of the Review Board. 

The Review Board was a non-judicial body under the Gun Court Act, 1974. 

Lord Diplock while recording the majority view in Hinds case (supra), 

observed as under:-

"…..In seeking to apply to the interpretation of the Constitution of 
Jamaica what has been said in particular cases about other constitutions, 
care must be taken to distinguish between judicial reasoning which 
depended on the express words used in the particular constitution under 
consideration and reasoning which depended on what, though not 
expressed, is nonetheless a necessary implication from the subject-matter 
and structure of the constitution and the circumstances in which it had 
been made. Such caution is particularly necessary in cases dealing with a 
federal constitution in which the question immediately in issue may have 
depended in part on the separation of the judicial power from the 
legislative or executive power of the federation or of one of its component 
states and in part upon the division of judicial power between the 
federation and a component state. 
Nevertheless all these constitutions have two things in common 
which have an important bearing on their interpretation. They differ 
fundamentally in their nature from ordinary legislation passed by the 
parliament of a sovereign state. They embody what is in substance an 
agreement reached between representatives of the various shades of 
political opinion in the state as to the structure of the organs of government 
through which the plenitude of the sovereign power of the state is to be 
exercised in future. All of them were negotiated as well as drafted by 
persons nurtured in the tradition of that branch of the common law of 
England that is concerned with public law and familiar in particular with the 
basic concept of separation of legislative, executive and judicial power as it 
had been developed in the unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom. 
As to their subject-matter, the peoples for whom new constitutions were 
being provided were already living under a system of public law in which 
the local institutions through which government was carried on, the 
legislature, the executive and the courts, reflected the same basic concept. 
The new constitutions, particularly in the case of unitary states, were 
evolutionary not revolutionary. They provided for continuity of government 
through successor institutions, legislative, executive and judicial, of which 
the members were to be selected in a different way, but each institution 
was to exercise powers which, although enlarged, remained of a similar 
character to those that had been exercised by the corresponding institution 
that it had replaced. 

35 


Page 36 

Because of this a great deal can be, and in drafting practice often is, 
left to necessary implication from the adoption in the new constitution of a 
governmental structure which makes provision for a legislature, an 
executive and a judicature. It is taken for granted that the basic principle of 
separation of powers will apply to the exercise of their respective functions 
by these three organs of government. Thus the constitution does not 
normally contain any express prohibition on the exercise of legislative 
powers by the executive or of judicial powers by either the executive or the 
legislature. As respects the judicature, particularly if it is intended that the 
previously existing courts shall continue to function, the constitution itself 
may even omit any express provision conferring judicial power upon the 
judicature. Nevertheless it is well established as a rule of construction 
applicable to constitutional instruments under which this governmental 
structure is adopted that the absence of express words to that effect does 
not prevent the legislative, the executive and the judicial powers of the new 
state being exercisable exclusively by the legislature, by the executive and 
by the judicature respectively. To seek to apply to constitutional 
instruments the canons of construction applicable to ordinary legislation in 
the fields of substantive criminal or civil law would, in their Lordships' view, 
be misleading -particularly those applicable to taxing statutes as to which 
it is a well-established principle that express words are needed to impose a 
charge on the subject. 
In the result there can be discerned in all those constitutions which 
have their origin in an Act of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster or in 
an Order in Council, a common pattern and style of draftsmanship which 
may conveniently be described as 'the Westminster model.' 
Before turning to those express provisions of the Constitution of 
Jamaica upon which the appellants rely in these appeals, their 
Lordships will make some general observations about the interpretation of 
constitutions which follow the Westminster model. 
All Constitutions on the Westminster model deal under separate 
Chapter headings with the legislature, the executive and the judicature. 
The Chapter dealing with the judicature invariably contains provisions 
dealing with the method of appointment and security of tenure of the 
members of the judiciary which are designed to assure to them a degree of 
independence from the other two branches of government. It may, as in 
the case of the Constitution of Ceylon, contain nothing more. To the extent 
to which the Constitution itself is silent as to the distribution of the plenitude 
of judicial power between various courts it is implicit that it shall continue to 
be distributed between and exercised by the courts that were already in 
existence when the new Constitution came into force; but the legislature, in 
the exercise of its power to make laws for the 'peace, order and good 
government' of the state, may provide for the establishment of new courts 
and for the transfer to them of the whole or part of the jurisdiction 
previously exercisable by an existing court. What, however, is implicit in 

36 


Page 37 

the very structure of a Constitution on the Westminster model is that 
judicial power, however it be distributed from time to time between various 
courts, is to continue to be vested in persons appointed to hold judicial 
office in the manner and on the terms laid down in the Chapter dealing with 
the judicature, even though this is not expressly stated in the 
Constitution (Liyanage v. R. [1966] 1 All ER 650 at 658, [1967] A.C. 259 at 
287, 288). 
The more recent constitutions on the Westminster model, unlike 
their earlier prototypes, include a Chapter dealing with fundamental rights 
and freedoms. The provisions of this Chapter form part of the substantive 
law of the state and until amended by whatever special procedure is laid 
down in the Constitution for this purpose, impose a fetter upon the exercise 
by the legislature, the executive and the judiciary of the plenitude of their 
respective powers. The remaining Chapters of the Constitutions are 
primarily concerned not with the legislature, the executive and the 
judicature as abstractions, but with the persons who shall be entitled 
collectively or individually to exercise the plenitude of legislative, executive 
or judicial powers -their qualifications for legislative, executive or judicial 
office, the methods of selecting them, their tenure of office, the procedure 
to be followed where powers are conferred on a class of persons acting 
collectively and the majorities required for the exercise of those powers. 
Thus, where a constitution on the Westminster model speaks of a 
particular 'court' already in existence when the Constitution comes into 
force it uses this expression as a collective description of all those 
individual judges who, whether sitting alone or with other judges or with a 
jury, are entitled to exercise the jurisdiction exercised by that court before 
the Constitution came into force. Any express provision in the constitution 
for the appointment or security of tenure of judges of that court will apply to 
all individual judges subsequently appointed to exercise an analogous 
jurisdiction, whatever other name may be given to the 'court' in which they 
sit ( Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada) [1925] 
A.C. 750. 
Where, under a constitution on the Westminster model, a law is 
made by the Parliament which purports to confer jurisdiction on a court 
described by a new name, the question whether the law conflicts with the 
provisions of the constitution dealing with the exercise of the judicial power 
does not depend upon the label (in the instant case 'The Gun Court') which 
the Parliament attaches to the judges when exercising the jurisdiction 
conferred on them by the law whose constitutionality is impugned. It is the 
substance of the law that must be regarded, not the form. What is the 
nature of the jurisdiction to be exercised by the judges who are to compose 
the court to which the new label is attached? Does the method of their 
appointment and the security of their tenure conform to the requirements of 
the constitution applicable to judges who, at the time the constitution came 
into force, exercised jurisdiction of that nature? (Attorney-General for 

37 


Page 38 

Australia v. R. and Boilermakers' Society of Australia, [1957] A.C. 288 , 
309-310).

…..So in deciding whether any provisions of a law passed by the 
Parliament of Jamaica as an ordinary law are inconsistent with the 
Constitution of Jamaica, neither the courts of Jamaica nor their Lordships' 
Board are concerned with the propriety or expediency of the law 
impugned. They are concerned solely with whether those provisions, 
however reasonable and expedient, are of such a character that they 
conflict with an entrenched provision of the Constitution and so can be 
validly passed only after the Constitution has been amended by the 
method laid down by it for altering that entrenched provision." 

The question examined by the Privy Council in the background of the 

factual/legal position expressed above, was recorded in the following words:-

"The attack on the constitutionality of the Full Court Division of the Gun 
Court may be based on two grounds. The first is that the Gun Court Act 
1974 purports to confer on a court consisting of persons qualified and 
appointed as resident magistrates a jurisdiction which under the provisions 
of Chapter VII of the Constitution is exercisable only by a person qualified 
and appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court. The second ground is 
much less fundamental. It need only be mentioned briefly, for it arises only 
if the first ground fails. It is that even if the conferment of jurisdiction on a 
Full Court Division consisting of three resident magistrates is valid, section 
112 of the Constitution requires that any assignment of a resident 
magistrate to sit in that division should be made by the Governor-General 
acting on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission and not 
by the Chief Justice as the 1974 Act provides." 

The question was dealt with, by opining as under:-

"Chapter VII of the Constitution, 'The Judicature,' was in their 
Lordships' view intended to deal with the appointment and security of 
tenure of all persons holding any salaried office by virtue of which they are 
entitled to exercise civil or criminal jurisdiction in Jamaica. For this purpose 
they are divided into two categories: (i) a higher judiciary, consisting of 
judges of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeal, and (ii) a 
lower judiciary, consisting of those described in section 112 (2) , viz.: 
'... Resident magistrate, judge of the Traffic Court, Registrar of the 
Supreme Court, Registrar of the Court of Appeal and such other 
offices connected with the courts of Jamaica as, subject to the 
provisions of this Constitution, may be prescribed by Parliament.' 
Apart from the offices of judge and registrar of the Court of Appeal 
which were new, these two categories embraced all salaried members of 

38 


Page 39 

the judiciary who exercised civil or criminal jurisdiction in Jamaica at the 
date when the Constitution came into force. A minor jurisdiction, 
particularly in relation to juveniles, was exercised by justices of the peace 
but, as in England, they sat part-time only, were unpaid and were not 
required to possess any professional qualification. 
Common to both categories, with the exception of the Chief Justice 
of the Supreme Court and the President of the Court of Appeal, is the 
requirement under the Constitution that they should be appointed by the 
Governor-General on the recommendation of the Judicial Service 
Commission -a body established under section 111 whose composition is 
different from that of the Public Service Commission and consists of 
persons likely to be qualified to assess the fitness of a candidate for 
judicial office. 
The distinction between the higher judiciary and the lower judiciary is 
that the former are given a greater degree of security of tenure than the 
latter. There is nothing in the Constitution to protect the lower judiciary 
against Parliament passing ordinary laws (a) abolishing their office (b) 
reducing their salaries while they are in office or (c) providing that their 
appointments to judicial office shall be only for a short fixed term of years. 
Their independence of the good-will of the political party which commands 
a bare majority in the Parliament is thus not fully assured. The only 
protection that is assured to them by section 112 is that they cannot be 
removed or disciplined except on the recommendation of the Judicial 
Service Commission with a right of appeal to the Privy Council. This last is 
a local body established under section 82 of the Constitution whose 
members are appointed by the Governor-General after consultation with 
the Prime Minister and hold office for a period not exceeding three years. 
In contrast to this, judges of the Supreme Court and of the Court of 
Appeal are given a more firmly rooted security of tenure. They are 
protected by entrenched provisions of the Constitution against Parliament 
passing ordinary laws (a) abolishing their office (b) reducing their salaries 
while in office or (c) providing that their tenure of office shall end before 
they attain the age of 65 years. They are not subject to any disciplinary 
control while in office. They can only be removed from office on the advice 
of the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council in the United 
Kingdom given on a reference made on the recommendation of a tribunal 
of inquiry consisting of persons who hold or have held high judicial office in 
some part of the Commonwealth. 
The manifest intention of these provisions is that all those who hold 
any salaried judicial office in Jamaica shall be appointed on the 
recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission and that their 
independence from political pressure by Parliament or by the Executive in 
the exercise of their judicial functions shall be assured by granting to them 
such degree of security of tenure in their office as is justified by the 
importance of the jurisdiction that they exercise. A clear distinction is 

39 


Page 40 

drawn between the security of tenure appropriate to those judges who 
exercise the jurisdiction of the higher judiciary and that appropriate to 
those judges who exercise the jurisdiction of the lower judiciary. 
Their Lordships accept that there is nothing in the Constitution to 
prohibit Parliament from establishing by an ordinary law a court under a 
new name, such as the "Revenue Court," to exercise part of the jurisdiction 
that was being exercised by members of the higher judiciary or by 
members of the lower judiciary at the time when the Constitution came into 
force. To do so is merely to change the label to be attached to the capacity 
in which the persons appointed to be members of the new court exercise a 
jurisdiction previously exercised by the holders of one or other of the 
judicial offices named in Chapter VII of the Constitution. In their Lordships' 
view, however, it is the manifest intention of the Constitution that any 
person appointed to be a member of such a court should be appointed in 
the same manner and entitled to the same security of tenure as the holder 
of the judicial office named in Chapter VII of the Constitution which entitled 
him to exercise the corresponding jurisdiction at the time when the 
Constitution came into force. 
Their Lordships understand the Attorney-General to concede that 
salaried judges of any new court that Parliament may establish by an 
ordinary law must be appointed in the manner and entitled to the security 
of tenure provided for members of the lower judiciary by section 112 of the 
Constitution. In their Lordships' view this concession was rightly made. To 
adopt the familiar words used by Viscount Simonds in Attorney-General of 
Australia v. R. and Boilermakers' Society of Australia [1957] A.C. 288 , 309-
310, it would make a mockery of the Constitution if Parliament could 
transfer the jurisdiction previously exercisable by holders of the judicial 
offices named in Chapter VII of the Constitution to holders of new judicial 
offices to which some different name was attached and to provide that 
persons holding the new judicial offices should not be appointed in the 
manner and on the terms prescribed in Chapter VII for the appointment of 
members of the judicature. If this were the case there would be nothing to 
prevent Parliament from transferring the whole of the judicial power of 
Jamaica (with two minor exceptions referred to below) to bodies composed 
of persons who, not being members of 'the Judicature,' would not be 
entitled to the protection of Chapter VII at all. 
What the Attorney-General does not concede is that Parliament is 
prohibited by Chapter VII from transferring to a court composed of duly 
appointed members of the lower judiciary jurisdiction which, at the time the 
Constitution came into force, was exercisable only by a court composed of 
duly appointed members of the higher judiciary. 
In their Lordships' view section 110 of the Constitution makes it 
apparent that in providing in section 103 (1) that: 'There shall be a Court of 
Appeal for Jamaica …' the draftsman treated this form of words as carrying 
with it by necessary implication that the judges of the court required to be 

40 


Page 41 

established under section 103 should exercise an appellate jurisdiction in 
all substantial civil cases and in all serious criminal cases; and that the 
words that follow, viz. 'which shall have such jurisdiction and powers as 
may be conferred upon it by this Constitution or any other law,' do not 
entitle Parliament by an ordinary law to deprive the Court of Appeal of a 
significant part of such appellate jurisdiction or to confer it on judges who 
do not enjoy the security of tenure which the Constitution guarantees to 
judges of the Court of Appeal. Section 110 (1) of the Constitution which 
grants to litigants wide rights of appeal to Her Majesty in Council but only 
from 'decisions of the Court of Appeal,' clearly proceeds on this 
assumption as to the effect of section 103, Section 110 would be rendered 
nugatory if its wide appellate jurisdiction could be removed from the Court 
of Appeal by an ordinary law without amendment of the Constitution. 
Their Lordships see no reason why a similar implication should not 
be drawn from the corresponding words of section 97. The Court of Appeal 
of Jamaica was a new court established under the Judicature (Appellate 
Jurisdiction) Law 1962 , which came into force one day before the 
Constitution, viz. on 5 August, 1962. The Supreme Court of Jamaica had 
existed under that title since 1880. In the judges of that court there had 
been vested all that jurisdiction in Jamaica which in their Lordships' view 
was characteristic of a court to which in 1962 the description 'a Supreme 
Court' was appropriate in a hierarchy of courts which was to include a 
separate 'Court of Appeal.' The three kinds of jurisdiction that are 
characteristic of a Supreme Court where appellate jurisdiction is vested in 
a separate court are: (1) unlimited original jurisdiction in all substantial civil 
cases; (2) unlimited original jurisdiction in all serious criminal offences; (3) 
supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings of inferior courts (viz. of the 
kind which owes its origin to the prerogative writs of certiorari, mandamus 
and prohibition). 
That section 97 (1) of the Constitution was intended to preserve in 
Jamaica a Supreme Court exercising this characteristic jurisdiction is, in 
their Lordships' view, supported by the provision in section 13 (1) of the 
Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, that 'the Supreme Court in 
existence immediately before the commencement of this Order shall be the 
Supreme Court for the purposes of the Constitution.' This is made an 
entrenched provision of the Constitution itself by section 21 (1) of the 
Order in Council, and confirms that the kind of court referred to in the 
words 'There shall be a Supreme Court for Jamaica' was a court which 
would exercise in Jamaica the three kinds of jurisdiction characteristic of a 
Supreme Court that have been indicated above. 
If, as contended by the Attorney-General, the words italicised above 
in section 97 (1) entitled Parliament by an ordinary law to strip the 
Supreme Court of all jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases other than that 
expressly conferred upon it by section 25 and section 44, what would be 
left would be a court of such limited jurisdiction that the label 'Supreme 

41 


Page 42 

Court' would be a false description; so too if all its jurisdiction (with those 
two exceptions) were exercisable concurrently by other courts composed 
of members of the lower judiciary. But more important, for this is the 
substance of the matter, the individual citizen could be deprived of the 
safeguard, which the makers of the Constitution regarded as necessary, of 
having important questions affecting his civil or criminal responsibilities 
determined by a court, however named, composed of judges whose 
independence from all local pressure by Parliament or by the executive 
was guaranteed by a security of tenure more absolute than that provided 
by the Constitution for judges of inferior courts. 
Their Lordships therefore are unable to accept that the words in 
section 97 (1), upon which the Attorney-General relies, entitle Parliament 
by an ordinary law to vest in a new court composed of members of 
the lower judiciary a jurisdiction that forms a significant part of the unlimited 
civil, criminal or supervisory jurisdiction that is characteristic of a 'Supreme 
Court' and was exercised by the Supreme Court of Jamaica at the time 
when the Constitution came into force, at any rate where such vesting is 
accompanied by ancillary provisions, such as those contained in section 6 
(1) of the Gun Court Act 1974 , which would have the consequence that all 
cases falling within the jurisdiction of the new court would in practice be 
heard and determined by it instead of by a court composed of judges of the 
Supreme Court.

In their Lordships' view the provisions of the 1974 Act, in so far as 
they provide for the establishment of a Full Court Division of the Gun Court 
consisting of three resident magistrates, conflict with Chapter VII of the 
Constitution and are accordingly void by virtue of section 2. 
xxxx 
xxxx 
xxxx 
Thus Parliament, in the exercise of its legislative power, may make a 
law imposing limits upon the discretion of the judges who preside over the 
courts by whom offences against that law are tried to inflict on an individual 
offender a custodial sentence the length of which reflects the judge's own 
assessment of the gravity of the offender's conduct in the particular 
circumstance of his case. What Parliament cannot do, consistently with the 
separation of powers, is to transfer from the judiciary to any executive body 
whose members are not appointed under Chapter VII of the Constitution, a 
discretion to determine the severity of the punishment to be inflicted upon 
an individual member of a class of offenders. Whilst none would suggest 
that a Review Board composed as is provided in section 22 of the Gun 
Court Act 1974 would not perform its duties responsibly and impartially, the 
fact remains that the majority of its members are not persons qualified by 
the Constitution to exercise judicial powers. A breach of a constitutional 
restriction is not excused by the good intentions with which the legislative 
power has been exceeded by the particular law. If, consistently with the 
Constitution, it is permissible for the Parliament to confer the discretion to 

42 


Page 43 

determine the length of custodial sentences for criminal offences on a body 
composed as the Review Board is, it would be equally permissible to a 
less well-intentioned Parliament to confer the same discretion on any other 
person or body of persons not qualified to exercise judicial powers, and in 
this way, without any amendment of the Constitution, to open the door to 
the exercise of arbitrary power by the executive in the whole field of 
criminal law. 
xxxx 
xxxx 
xxxx 
Their Lordships would hold that the provisions of section 8 of the Act 
relating to the mandatory sentence of detention during the Governor-
General's pleasure and the provisions of section 22 relating to the Review 
Board are a law made after the coming into force of the Constitution which 
is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution relating to the 
separation of powers. They are accordingly void by virtue of section 2 of 
the Constitution." 

(ii) In the same sequence, learned counsel for the petitioners invited our 

attention to Liyanage v. Reginam, (1966) 1 All ER 650. It is first necessary to 

record the factual/legal matrix, in the cited judgment. All the 11 appellants in the 

matter before the Privy Council, were charged with offences arising out of an 

abortive coup d'e'tat on 27.1.1962. The factum of the said coup d'e'tat, was set 

out in a White Paper issued by the Government of Ceylon on 13.2.1962. The 

White Paper gave the names of 13 alleged conspirators including the appellants. 

The White Paper concluded by observing, that a deterrent punishment of a 

severe character ought to be imposed, on all those who were guilty. On 

16.3.1962, the Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act, No. 1 of 1962 was passed. 

It was given retrospective effect from 1.1.1962. It was limited in operation to 

those who were accused of offences against the State, on or around 27.1.1962. 

The above Act legalized imprisonment of the appellants, while they were awaiting 

trial. It modified a section of the Penal Code, so as to enact ex post facto, a new 

offence, to meet the circumstance of the abortive coup. It altered ex post facto, 

43 


Page 44 

the law of evidence, regarding settlements made by an accused, while in 

custody. It enacted a minimum punishment, accompanied by forfeiture of 

property, for the offences for which the appellants were tried. Under Section 

440A of the Criminal Procedure Code, trial in case of sedition, could be directed 

to be before three judges without a jury. The instant provision was amended by 

the above Act, so as to extend the same, to the offences for which the appellants 

were charged. Under Section 9 of the above Act, the Minister of Justice was 

empowered to nominate the three judges. In exercise of his powers under 

Section 9, the Minister of Justice had nominated three judges, to try the 

appellants without a jury. The Supreme Court upheld the objection raised by the 

appellants, that Section 9 was ultra vires the Constitution of Ceylon, and that, the 

nomination was invalid. Thereafter, the Criminal Law Act, No. 31 of 1962 was 

passed. It repealed Section 9 of the earlier Act. It amended the power of 

nomination, in that, the power was conferred on the Chief Justice. On appeal by 

the appellants, against the conviction and sentence from their trial before a Court 

of three judges nominated under the Act, it was held, that the Criminal Law 

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 1 of 1962, as well as, the Criminal Law Act, No. 31 

of 1962, were invalid for the two reasons. Firstly, under the Constitution of 

Ceylon, there was a separation of powers. The power of the judicature, while the 

Constitution stood, could not be usurped or infringed by the executive or the 

legislature. Secondly, the Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act, No. 1 of 1962, 

as well as, the Criminal Law Act, No. 31 of 1962 were aimed at individuals 

concerned in an abortive coup, and were not legislation effecting criminal law of 

44 


Page 45 

general application. Although not every enactment ad hominem, and ex post 

facto, necessarily infringed the judicial power, yet there was such infringement in 

the present case, by the above two Acts. In addition to the above conclusions, it 

was also held, that the joint effect of the Ceylon Constitution Order in Council 

1946, and the Ceylon Independence Act, 1947, was intended to, and resulted in, 

giving the Ceylon Parliament, full legislative powers of an independent sovereign 

State. Consequently, the legislative power of the Ceylon Parliament, was not 

limited by inability to pass laws, which offended fundamental principles of justice. 

The Privy Council while examining the above controversy, rendered the following 

opinion:-

"In Ceylon, however, the position was different. The change of sovereignty 
did not in itself produce any apparent change in the constituents or the 
functioning of the Judicature. So far as the courts were concerned their 
work continued unaffected by the new Constitution, and the Ordinances 
under which they functioned remained in force. The judicial system had 
been established in Ceylon by the Charter of Justice in 1833. Clause 4 of 
the Charter read: 
"And to provide for the administration of justice hereafter in Our said 
Island Our will and pleasure is, and We do hereby direct that the 
entire administration of justice, civil and criminal therein, shall be 
vested exclusively in the courts erected and constituted by this Our 
Charter ... and it is Our pleasure and We hereby declare, that it is 
not, and shall not be competent to the Governor of Our said Island 
by any Law or Ordinance to be by him made, with the advice of the 
Legislative Council thereof or otherwise howsoever, to constitute or 
establish any court for the administration of justice in any case civil 
or criminal, save as hereinafter is expressly saved and provided." 
Clause 5 established the Supreme Court and clause 6 a Chief Justice and 
two puisne judges. Clause 7 gave the Governor powers of appointing their 
successors. There follow many clauses with regard to administrative, 
procedural and jurisdictional matters. Some half a century later Ordinances 
(in particular the Courts Ordinance) continued the jurisdiction and 
procedure of the courts. Thereunder the courts have functioned 
continuously up to the present day.

Page 46 

The Constitution is significantly divided into parts -"Part 2 The 
Governor-General," "Part 3 The Legislature," "Part 4 Delimitation of 
Electoral Districts," "Part 5 The Executive," "Part 6 The Judicature," "Part 7 
The Public Service," "Part 8 Finance." And although no express mention is 
made of vesting in the judicature the judicial power which it already had 
and was wielding in its daily process under the Courts Ordinance, there is 
provision under Part 6 for the appointment of judges by a Judicial Service 
Commission which shall not contain a member of either House, but shall 
be composed of the Chief Justice and a judge and another person who is 
or shall have been a judge. Any attempt to influence any decision of the 
Commission is made a criminal offence. There is also provision that judges 
shall not be removable except by the Governor-General on an address of 
both Houses. 
These provisions manifest an intention to secure in the judiciary a 
freedom from political, legislative and executive control. They are wholly 
appropriate in a Constitution which intends that judicial power shall be 
vested only in the judicature. They would be inappropriate in a Constitution 
by which it was intended that judicial power should be shared by the 
executive or the legislature. The Constitution's silence as to the vesting of 
judicial power is consistent with its remaining, where it had lain for more 
than a century, in the hands of the judicature. It is not consistent with any 
intention that henceforth it should pass to or be shared by, the executive or 
the legislature. 
Counsel for the appellants succinctly summarises his attack on the 
Acts in question as follows. The first Act was wholly bad in that it was a 
special direction to the judiciary as to the trial of particular prisoners who 
were identifiable (in view of the White Paper) and charged with particular 
offences on a particular occasion. The pith and substance of both Acts was 
a legislative plan ex post facto to secure the conviction and enhance the 
punishment of those particular individuals. It legalised their imprisonment 
while they were awaiting trial. It made admissible their statements 
inadmissibly obtained during that period. It altered the fundamental law of 
evidence so as to facilitate their conviction. and finally it altered ex post 
facto the punishment to be imposed on them. 
In their Lordships' view that cogent summary fairly describes the 
effect of the Acts. As has been indicated already, legislation ad hominem 
which is thus directed to the course of particular proceedings may not 
always amount to an interference with the functions of the judiciary. But in 
the present case their Lordships have no doubt that there was such 
interference; that it was not only the likely but the intended effect of the 
impugned enactments; and that it is fatal to their validity. The true nature 
and purpose of these enactments are revealed by their conjoint impact on 
the specific proceedings in respect of which they were designed, and they 
take their colour, in particular, from the alterations they purported to make 
as to their ultimate objective, the punishment of those convicted. These 

46 


Page 47 

alterations constituted a grave and deliberate incursion into the judicial 
sphere. Quite bluntly, their aim was to ensure that the judges in dealing 
with these particular persons on these particular charges were deprived of 
their normal discretion as respects appropriate sentences. They were 
compelled to sentence each offender on conviction to not less than ten 
years' imprisonment, and compelled to order confiscation of his 
possessions, even though his part in the conspiracy might have been 
trivial. 
The trial court concluded its long and careful judgment with these 
words ((1965), 67 CNLR at p. 424): 
"But we must draw attention to the fact that the Act of 1962 radically 
altered ex post facto the punishment to which the defendants are 
rendered liable. The Act removed the discretion of the court as to the 
period of the sentence to be imposed, and compels the court to 
impose a term of 10 years' imprisonment, although we would have 
wished to differentiate in the matter of sentence between those who 
organised the conspiracy and those who were induced to join it. It 
also imposes a compulsory forfeiture of property. These 
amendments were not merely retroactive: they were also ad hoc, 
applicable only to the conspiracy which was the subject of the 
charges we have tried. We are unable to understand this 
discrimination. To the courts, which must be free of political bias, 
treasonable offences are equally heinous, whatever be the 
complexion of the Government in power or whoever be the 
offenders." 
Their Lordships sympathise with that protest and wholly agree with 
it. 
One might fairly apply to these Acts the words of Chase J., in the 
Supreme Court of the United States in Calder v. Bull: "These acts were 
legislative judgments; and an exercise of judicial power." 
Blackstone in his Commentaries, Vol. I (4 th Edition), p. 44, wrote: 
"Therefore a particular act of the legislature to confiscate the goods 
of Titius, or to attaint him of high treason does not enter into the idea 
of a municipal law: for the operation of this act is spent upon Titius 
only and has no relation to the community in General: it is rather a 
sentence than a law." 
If such Acts as these were valid the judicial power could be wholly 
absorbed by the legislature and taken out of the hands of the judges. It is 
appreciated that the legislature had no such general intention. It was beset 
by a grave situation and it took grave measures to deal with it, thinking, 
one must presume, that it had power to do so and was acting rightly; But 
that consideration is irrelevant, and gives no validity to acts which infringe 
the Constitution. What is done once, if it be allowed, may be done again 
and in a lesser crisis and less serious circumstances; and thus judicial 
power may be eroded. Such an erosion is contrary to the clear intention of 

47 


Page 48 

the Constitution. In their Lordships' view the Acts were ultra vires and 
invalid. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
It was agreed between the parties that if the Acts were ultra vires 
and invalid, the convictions cannot stand. Their Lordships have therefore 
humbly advised Her Majesty that this appeal should be allowed and that 
the convictions should be quashed." 

(iii) Reference was then made to Director of Public Prosecutions of Jamaica v. 

Mollison, (2003) 2 AC 411. The factual controversy which led to the above cited 

decision of the Privy Council may be noticed. On 16.3.1994, when Kurt Mollison 

was merely 16 years old, he committed a murder in furtherance of a robbery. His 

offence was described as a "capital murder", under the law of Jamaica. After his 

trial, he was convicted on 21.4.1997, when he was 19 years old. On 25.4.997, 

he was sentenced under Section 29(1) of the Juveniles Act, 1951, to be detained 

during the Governor-General's pleasure. On 16.2.2000, although the Court of 

Appeal refused his prayer for leave to appeal against his conviction, it agreed to 

examine his contention, whether the sentence imposed on him was compatible 

with the provisions of the Constitution of Jamaica. The Court of Appeal accepted 

his contention. The sentence of detention, during the Governor-General's 

pleasure, was set aside. In its place, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, with 

the recommendation that, he be not considered for parole till he had served a 

term of 20 years' imprisonment. In the controversy which came up for 

consideration before the Privy Council, there were two main issues. Firstly, 

whether the sentence of detention during the Governor-General's pleasure 

authorized by Section 29(1), was a power exercised by him in his executive 

capacity. And secondly, whether the power to determine the measure for 

48 


Page 49 

punishment to be inflicted on an offender, is compatible with the Constitution. 

The Privy Council, while examining the controversy, opined as under:-

"Section 29 of the Juveniles Act 1951 
[3] 
Section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1864, as amended, 
provides that every person convicted of capital murder shall be sentenced 
to death. But special provision has been made for those who commit this 
crime when aged under 18. Following a number of amendments made 
pursuant to section 4 of the Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962 
(SI 1962/1500), section 29 of the Juveniles Act 1951 now provides, so far 
as material to the main issue in this appeal, as follows: 
"(1) Sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded 
against a person convicted of an offence if it appears to the court 
that at the time when the offence was committed he was under the 
age of 18 years, but in place thereof the court shall sentence him to 
be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure, and, if so sentenced, he 
shall, notwithstanding anything in the other provisions of this Law, be 
liable to be detained in such place (including, save in the case of a 
child, an adult correctional centre) and under such conditions as the 
Minister may direct, and while so detained shall be deemed to be in 
legal custody. 
(4) The Governor-General may release on licence any person 
detained under subsection (1) or (3) of this section. Such licence 
shall be in such form and contain such conditions as the Governor-
General may direct, and may at any time be revoked or varied by the 
Governor-General. Where such licence is revoked the person to 
whom it relates shall return forthwith to such place as the Governor-
General may direct, and if he fails to do so may be arrested by any 
constable without warrant and taken to such place." 
[4] 
Section 29 as originally enacted was amended in 1964 to substitute 
"Minister" for "Governor" in subsection (1) and "Governor General" 
for "Governor" in each of the four references originally made to the 
Governor in subsection (4). In 1975 subsection (1) was further amended to 
make plain, reversing the effect of Baker v The Queen, [1975] AC 774, 
[1975] 3 All ER 55, that the statutory prohibition on pronouncement of the 
death sentence applied to those appearing to be aged under 18 at the time 
when they had committed the offence, not at the time of sentence. In 1985, 
the reference to "an adult correctional centre" was substituted for the 
previous reference to "a prison". The enacted reference to "Her Majesty's 
pleasure" has not, however, been amended, no doubt because section 
68(2) of the Constitution of Jamaica provides that the executive authority of 
Jamaica may be exercised on behalf of Her Majesty by the Governor-
General. In recognition of this constitutional reality, it appears to be the 
practice where section 29(1) applies, as was done in this case, to call the 

49 


Page 50 

sentence one of detention during the Governor-General's pleasure, and in 
this opinion that usage will be adopted. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
The Constitution 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
The first question: is section 29 compatible with the Constitution of 
Jamaica? 
[11] Both the Director and the Solicitor-General, who appeared with him, 
accepted at the hearing that, subject to their argument based on section 
26(8) of the Constitution, section 29 of the Juveniles Act 1951 infringes the 
rights guaranteed by, and so is inconsistent with, sections 15(1)(b) and 
20(1) of the Constitution. Given this concession, rightly made, it is 
unnecessary to do more than note the reason for it. A person detained 
during the Governor-General's pleasure is deprived of his personal liberty 
not in execution of the sentence or order of a court but at the discretion of 
the executive. Such a person is not afforded a fair hearing by an 
independent and impartial court, because the sentencing of a criminal 
defendant is part of the hearing and in cases such as the present sentence 
is effectively passed by the executive and not by a court independent of 
the executive. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
[13] …..It does indeed appear that the sentencing provisions under 
challenge in the Hinds case were held to be unconstitutional not because 
of their repugnancy to any of the rights guaranteed by sections in Chapter 
III of the Constitution but because of their incompatibility with a principle on 
which the Constitution itself was held to be founded. There appears to be 
no reason why (subject to the other arguments considered below) the 
reasoning in the Hindscase does not apply to the present case. It would no 
doubt be open to the Board to reject that reasoning, but it would be 
reluctant to depart from a decision which has stood unchallenged for 25 
years, the more so since the decision gives effect to a very important and 
salutary principle. Whatever overlap there may be under constitutions on 
the Westminster model between the exercise of executive and legislative 
powers, the separation between the exercise of judicial powers on the one 
hand and legislative and executive powers on the other is total or 
effectively so. Such separation, based on the rule of law, was recently 
described by Lord Steyn as "a characteristic feature of democracies": R 
(Anderson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2002] 4 All ER 
1089, [2002] 3 WLR 1800, at pp. 1821-1822, para 5 of the latter report. In 
the opinion of the Board, Mr Fitzgerald has made good his challenge to 
section 29 based on its incompatibility with the constitutional principle that 
judicial functions (such as sentencing) must be exercised by the judiciary 
and not by the executive. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 

50 


Page 51 

…..The nature and purpose of the sentence of detention during the 
Governor-General's pleasure are clear, as explained above. The only 
question is who should decide on the measure of punishment the detainee 
should suffer. Since the vice of section 29 is to entrust this decision to the 
executive instead of the judiciary, the necessary modification to ensure 
conformity with the Constitution is (as in Browne v The Queen, [2000] 1 AC 
45) to substitute "the court's" for "Her Majesty's" in subsection (1) and "the 
court" for each reference to "the Governor-General" in subsection (4)." 

(iv) Our attention was also invited to Harry Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal 

Opportunity Commission, (1995) 183 CLR 245. The instant judgment was 

rendered by the High Court of Australia. The factual controversy which led to the 

above determination is being narrated first. The plaintiff Harry Brandy was 

engaged as an officer of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. 

The third defendant John Bell was also an officer of the said Commission. The 

plaintiff and the third defendant continued to serve the Commission until the 

Commission itself ceased to exist. On 13.3.1990, John Bell lodged a complaint 

with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, wherein he alleged, 

verbal abuse and threatening behaviour on the part of Harry Brandy, while both 

were in the employment of the Commission. Thereafter, John Bell issued a 

notice under Section 24 of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975. And accordingly, 

the Commissioner referred the complaint to the Commission. The power of the 

Commission, to hold an enquiry under the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 

against Harry Brandy, was exercised by the second defendant. The second 

defendant had been appointed under Section 24 of the Racial Discrimination Act, 

1975, which empowered the Minister, to appoint a person to perform and 

discharge the functions of the Commissioner. The second defendant returned 

51 


Page 52 

his findings under Section 25Z of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 on 

22.12.1993. The defendant's complaint was found to be substantiated. In 

disposing of the controversy, the second defendant required Harry Brandy, the 

plaintiff, to do the following acts/course of conduct:-

"(1) that the Plaintiff do apologise to the Third Defendant, the form of the 
apology being annexed to the determination; 
(2) that the Plaintiff do pay the sum of $2 500 to the Third Defendant by 
way of damages for the pain, humiliation, distress and loss of personal 
dignity suffered by the Third Defendant; 
(3) that ATSIC do take disciplinary action against the Plaintiff, in relation to 
the conduct which he perpetrated against the Third Defendant; 
(4) that ATSIC do apologise to the Third Defendant in relation to the 
handling of his complaint, the form of the apology being annexed to the 
determination; 
(5) that ATSIC do pay the sum of $10 000 to the Third Defendant by way 
of damages for the pain, humiliation, distress and loss of personal dignity 
suffered by the Third Defendant." 

In order to contest the determination rendered by the second defendant, Harry 

Brandy raised a challenge to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, 

1975. The challenge raised by him came to be formulated in the following 

words:-

"In consequence of the amendments embodied in the Sex Discrimination 
and other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 and/or the Law and Justice 
Legislation Amendment Act 1993 as they affect the Racial Discrimination 
Act 1975 are any, and if so which, of the provisions of Part III of the Racial 
Discrimination Act invalid?" 

While adjudicating upon the matter, the High Court of Australia held as under:-

"The plaintiff's challenge to the Act-
15. The plaintiff's challenge to particular provisions of the Act is based 
upon the proposition that they provide for an exercise of judicial power 
otherwise than in conformity with Ch.III of the Commonwealth Constitution 
in that the power is exercised by the Commission which is not a court 
established pursuant to s.71 and constituted in accordance with s.72 of the 
Constitution. The plaintiff further argues that the correctness of this 

52 


Page 53 

proposition is not affected by the provisions for review by the Federal 
Court. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
21. Although many decision-making functions may take their character as 
an exercise of judicial, executive or legislative power from their legislative 
setting, the character of the decision-maker and the nature of the decision-
making process, some decision-making functions are exclusive and 
inalienable exercises of judicial power (34 Reg. v. Davison (1954) 90 CLR 
at 368-370 per Dixon CJ and McTiernan J). As Dixon CJ and McTiernan J 
observed in Reg. v. Davison (35 ibid. at 369) : 
"The truth is that the ascertainment of existing rights by the judicial 
determination of issues of fact or law falls exclusively within judicial 
power so that the Parliament cannot confide the function to any 
person or body but a court constituted under ss.71 and 72 of the 
Constitution". 
In that statement, the expression "judicial determination" means an 
authoritative determination by means of the judicial method, that is, an 
enforceable decision reached by applying the relevant principles of law to 
the facts as found. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
25. Turning to the case before the Court, whatever might be the 
enforceability of a declaration that the plaintiff "do apologise", a declaration 
that the plaintiff "do pay the sum of $2 500" to the third defendant, once 
registered, attracts the operation of s.53 of the Federal Court of Australia 
Act 1976 (Cth). By that section, a person in whose favour a judgment is 
given is entitled to the same remedies for enforcement, by execution or 
otherwise, as are allowed by the laws of the State or Territory applicable. 
In the present case, this means New South Wales. Section 53 does not 
affect the operation of any provision made by or under any other Act or the 
Rules of Court for the execution and enforcement of judgments of the 
Court (40 s.53(2)) . 
26. But s.25ZAB goes beyond providing the machinery for the 
enforcement of a determination. It purports to give a registered 
determination effect "as if it were an order made by the Federal Court". A 
judicial order made by the Federal Court takes effect as an exercise of 
Commonwealth judicial power, but a determination by the Commission is 
neither made nor registered in the exercise of judicial power. An exercise 
of executive power by the Commission and the performance of an 
administrative function by the Registrar of the Federal Court simply cannot 
create an order which takes effect as an exercise of judicial power; 
conversely, an order which takes effect as an exercise of judicial power 
cannot be made except after the making of a judicial determination. Thus, 
s.25ZAB purports to prescribe what the Constitution does not permit." 

53 


Page 54 

(v) 
Our attention was then invited to Reference Re Residential Tenancies Act, 

123 DLR (3d) 554. The factual matrix, in furtherance of which the above 

judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada, is as follows. The 

provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act, 1979 (Ontario), by which the 

Residential Tenancy Commission was empowered to order eviction of tenants, 

as also, could require landlords and tenants to comply with the obligations 

imposed under the said Act, were assailed, as offending against the limitation 

contained in Section 96 of the British North America Act, 1867, and therefore, 

ultra vires. In recording its conclusions on a similar analogy, as in the judgments 

noticed above, the Supreme Court of Canada observed as under:-

"Under s. 92(14) of the British North America Act, 1867, the 
provincial Legislatures have the legislative power in relation to the 
administration of justice in the Province. This is a wide power but subject to 
subtraction of ss. 96 to 100 in favour of the federal authority. Under s. 
the Governor General has the sole power to appoint the judges of the 
Superior, District and County Courts in each Province. Under s. 97 the 
Judges who are to be appointed to the Superior, District and County 
Courts are to be selected from the respective bars of each Province. Under 
s. 100 the Parliament of Canada is obliged to fix and provide for their 
salaries. Section 92(14) and ss. 96 to 100 represent one of the important 
compromises of the Fathers of Confederation. It is plain that what was 
sought to be achieved through this compromise, and the intended effect of 
s. 96, would be destroyed if a Province could pass legislation creating a 
tribunal, appoint members thereto, and then confer on the tribunal the 
jurisdiction of the Superior Courts. What was conceived as a strong 
constitutional base for national unity, through a unitary judicial system, 
would be gravely undermined. Section 96 has thus come to be regarded 
as limiting provincial competence to make appointments to a tribunal 
exercising s. 96 judicial powers and therefore as implicitly limiting 
provincial competence to endow a provincial tribunal with such powers. 
IV 
The belief that any function which in 1867 had been vested in a s. 
Court must forever remain in that Court reached its apogee in the 
judgment of Lord Atkin in Toronto Corporation v. York Tp. Et. Al., (1938) 1 
DLR 593, (1938) AC 415, (1938) 1 WWR 452. Describing s. 96 as one of 




Page 55 

the "three principal pillars in the temple of justice… not to be undermined", 
Lord Atkin held that the Ontario Municipal Board could not validly receive 
"judicial authority". At the same time, he held that the Municipal Board was 
in 'pith and substance' an administrative body, and the impugned 'judicial 
functions' were severable from the administrative powers given to the 
Board under its enabling legislation. There was no analysis of the inter-
relationship between the judicial and administrative features of the 
legislative scheme; the assumption was that any attempt to confer a s. 96 
function on a provincially-appointed tribunal was ultra vires the Legislature. 
This sweeping interpretation of s. 96, with its accompanying restrictive 
view of provincial legislative authority under s. 92, was limited almost 
immediately by the judgment of this Court in the Reference re Adoption 
Act and Other Act, etc., (1938) 3 DLR 497, 71 CCC 110, (1938) SCR 398. 
Chief Justice Duff held that the jurisdiction of inferior Courts was not "fixed 
forever as it stood at the date of Confederation". On his view, it was quite 
possible to remove jurisdiction from a Superior Court and vest it in a Court 
of summary jurisdiction. The question which must be asked was whether 
"the jurisdiction conferred upon Magistrates under these statutes broadly 
conforms to a type of jurisdiction generally exercisable by Courts of 
summary jurisdiction rather than the jurisdiction of Courts within the 
purview of s. 96" (p. 514). In the Adoption Reference, Duff C.J. looked to 
the historical practice in England and concluded that the jurisdiction 
conferred on Magistrates under the legislation before the Court in 
the Reference was analogous to the jurisdiction under the English Poor 
Laws, a jurisdiction which had belonged to courts of summary nature 
rather than to Superior Courts. On this basis, the legislation was upheld. 
The Adoption Reference represented a liberalization of the view of s. 96 
adopted by the Privy Council in Toronto v. York, at least in the context of a 
transfer of jurisdiction from a Superior Court to an inferior Court. 
The same process of liberalization, this time in the context of a 
transfer of jurisdiction from a Superior Court to an administrative tribunal, 
was initiated by the Privy Council in Labour Relations Board of 
Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works, Limited, (1948) 4 DLR 673, (1949) 
AC 134, (1948) 2 WWR 1055. Lord Simonds proposed a two-fold test. 
The first limb of the test is to ask whether the board or tribunal exercises 
"judicial power". Lord Simonds did not propose a 'final' answer to the 
definition of "judicial power", but he suggested at p. 680 DLR, p. 149 AC, 
that: 
"…the conception of the judicial function is inseparably bound up 
with the idea of a suit between parties, whether between Crown and 
subject or between subject and subject, and that it is the duty of the 
Court to decide the issue between those parties, with whom alone it 
rests to initiate or defend or compromise the proceedings." 
If the answer to the initial question as to "judicial power" is in the 
negative, then that concludes the matter in favour of the provincial board. 

55 


Page 56 

If, however, the power is in fact a judicial power, then it becomes 
necessary to ask a second question: in the exercise of that power, is the 
tribunal analogous to a Superior, District or County Court? 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
Step two involves consideration of the function within its institutional setting 
to determine whether the function itself is different when viewed in that 
setting. In particular, can the function still be considered to be a 'judicial' 
function? In addressing the issue, it is important to keep in mind the further 
statement by Rand J. in Dupont v. Inglis (at p. 424 DLR, p. 543 SCR) that 
"…it is the subject-matter rather than the apparatus of adjudication that is 
determinative". Thus the question of whether any particular function is 
'judicial' is not to be determined simply on the basis of procedural 
trappings. The primary issue is the nature of the question which the 
tribunal is called upon to decide. Where the tribunal is faced with a private 
dispute between parties, and is called upon to adjudicate through the 
application of a recognized body of rules in a manner consistent with 
fairness and impartiality, then, normally, it is acting in a 'judicial capacity'. 
To borrow the terminology of Professor Ronald Dworkin, the judicial task 
involves questions of 'principle', that is, consideration of the competing 
rights of individuals or groups. This can be contrasted with questions of 
'policy' involving competing views of the collective good of the community 
as a whole. (See Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (1977) at pp. 82-90 
(Duckworth)." 

A perusal of the conclusions recorded by the Supreme Court of Canada reveals, 

that the court evolved a three step test to determine the constitutional validity of a 

provision which vested adjudicatory functions in an administrative tribunal. The 

first step was determined in the light of the historical conditions existing in 1867, 

i.e. before the British North America Act, 1867 was enacted. The first step 

required a determination whether at the time of Confederation, the power or 

jurisdiction now vested in an administrative tribunal, was exercised through a 

judicial court process. If the answer to the first step was in the negative, the 

constitution of the administrative tribunal would be valid. If historical evidence 

indicated, that the power, now vested with an administrative tribunal, was 

identical or analogous to a power exercised under Section 96 Courts at 

56 


Page 57 

Confederation, then the matter needed to be examined further. The second step 

was to determine, whether the power to be exercised by the administrative 

tribunal, should be considered as a judicial function. Insofar as the instant aspect 

of the matter is concerned, it was illustratively concluded, that where power 

vested in the administrative tribunal was in respect of adjudication of disputes 

between the parties, which required to be settled through an application of a 

recognized body of rules, in a manner consistent with fairness and impartiality, 

then the said power could be classified as judicial power/function. If, however, 

while applying the second step, the answer was in the negative, it was not 

necessary to proceed with the matter further, and the vesting of the power with 

the administrative tribunal should be considered as valid. If the power or 

jurisdiction is exercised in a judicial manner, then it is imperative to proceed to 

the third and final step. The third step contemplates analysis and review of the 

administrative tribunal's functions as a whole, and to examine the same in its 

entire institutional context. It contemplated an examination of the inter-

relationship between the administrative tribunal's judicial powers, and the other 

powers and jurisdiction conferred by the legislative enactment. If a judicial 

hearing is a must, whereafter a judgment was required to be rendered, the 

administrative tribunal would be deemed to be exercising jurisdiction which is 

ordinarily vested in a Court . It is after recording a finding in the affirmative on all 

the three steps, that it will be possible to conclude, whether judicial functions 

have been required to be exercised by the concerned administrative tribunal. 

Having examined the controversy in Reference Re Residential Tenancies Act 

57 


Page 58 

(supra), the Supreme Court of Canada arrived at the conclusion, that the 

Residential Tenancy Commission could have been authorized to grant orders for 

possession to a landlord or to grant orders for specific performance of a tenancy. 

23. Finally, learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on 

"Constitutional Law of Canada", by Peter W. Hogg (third edition, 1992, by 

Carswell, Thomson Professional Publishing) in order to assert, that even under 

Constitutions where the separation of power rule has not been explicitly provided 

for, there would be limitations in delegation of Court functions to tribunals. 

Relevant text on the subject, from the above treatise is being reproduced 

hereunder:-

"7.3 Implications of Constitution's judicature sections 
(a) Separation of powers 
There is no general "separation of powers" in the Constitution Act, 
1867. The Act does not separate the legislative, executive and judicial 
functions and insist that each branch of government exercise only "its own" 
function. 
As between the legislative and executive branches, any 
separation of powers would make little sense in a system of responsible 
government; and it is clearly established that the Act does not call for any 
such separation. As between the judicial and the two political branches, 
there is likewise no general separation of powers. Either the Parliament or 
the Legislatures may by appropriate legislation confer non-judicial 
functions on the courts and (with one important exception, to be discussed) 
may confer judicial functions on bodies that are not courts. 
Each Canadian jurisdiction has conferred non-judicial functions on 
its courts, by enacting a statute which enables the government to refer a 
question of law to the courts for an advisory opinion. The rendering of 
advisory opinions to government is traditionally an "executive" function, 
performed by the law officers of the government. For that reason, the 
supreme Court of the United States and the High Court of Australia have 
refused to render advisory opinions, reasoning that a separation of powers 
doctrine in their Constitutions confines the courts to the traditional judicial 
function of adjudicating upon genuine controversies. But in the Reference 
Appeal (1912), A-G Ont. V.A.-G. Can. (Reference Appeal) (1912) AC 571, 
the Privy Council refused to read any such limitation into Canada's 
Constitution. 
Their lordships upheld the federal reference statute, 

58 


Page 59 

apparently as a law in relation to the supreme court of Canada (s.101). 
The provincial reference statutes are also valid as laws in relation to the 
administration of justice in the province (s.92(14)). 
The conferral of judicial functions on bodies which are not courts is 
likewise subject to no general prohibition. However, here there is an 
important qualification to be made. The courts have held that the 
provincial Legislatures may not confer on a body other than a superior, 
district or county court judicial functions analogous to those performed by a 
superior, district or county court. This little separation of powers doctrine 
has been developed to preclude evasion of the stipulations of ss. 96 to 100 
of the constitution Act, 1867. 
If ss. 96 to 100 of the constitution Act, 1867 were read literally, they 
could easily be evaded by a province which wanted to assume control of 
its judicial appointments. The province could increase the jurisdiction of its 
inferior courts so that they assumed much of the jurisdiction of the higher 
courts; or the province could best higher-court jurisdiction in a newly-
established tribunal, and call that tribunal an inferior court or an 
administrative tribunal. It is therefore not surprising that the courts have 
added a gloss to s. 96 and the associated constitutional provisions. What 
they have said is this: if a province invests a tribunal with a jurisdiction of a 
kind that ought property to belong to a superior, district or county court, 
then that tribunal, whatever its official name, is for constitutional purposes 
a superior, district or county court and must satisfy the requirements of s. 
96 and the associated provisions of the constitution Act, 1867. This means 
that such a tribunal will be invalidly constituted, unless its members (1) are 
appointed by the federal government in conformity with s. 96, (2) are 
drawn from the bar of the province in conformity with ss. 97 and 98, and 
(3) receive salaries that are fixed and provided by the federal parliament in 
conformity with s. 100. 
So far the law is clear, and the policy underlying it is 
comprehensible. But the difficulty lies in the definition of those functions 
that ought properly to belong to a superior, district or county court. The 
courts have attempted to fashion a judicially enforceable rule which would 
separate "s. 96 functions" from other adjudicatory functions. The attempt 
has not been successful, and it is difficult to predict with confidence how 
the courts will characterize particular adjudicatory functions. 
The 
uncertainty of the law, with its risk of nullification, could be a serious 
deterrent to the conferral of new adjudicatory functions on inferior courts or 
administrative tribunals, and a consequent impediment to much new 
regulatory or social policy. For the most part, the courts have exercised 
restraint in reviewing the provincial statutes which create new adjudicatory 
jurisdictions, so that the difficulty has not been as serious as it could have 
been. However, in the last two decades, there has been a regrettable 
resurgence of s. 96 litigation: five challenges to the powers of inferior 
courts or tribunals based on s. 96 have succeeded in the Supreme Court

of Canada, A.G. Que. v. Farrah [1978] 2 S.C.R. 638; Re Residential 
Tenancies Act [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714; Crevier v. A.G. Que. [1981] 2 S.C.R.

[1983] 1 S.C.R. 704. Since the abolition of Privy Council appeals, two 
other challenges have also been successful, namely, A.G. Ont. v. Victoria 
medical building [1960] S.C.R. 32; Seminary of Chicoutimi v. A.G. Que. 
[1973] S.C.R. 681, and these decisions have spawned many more 
challenges. These developments are described in the text that follows. 

24. It was also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that 

the proposition of law highlighted hereinabove on the basis of the provisions of 

constitutions of different countries (Jamaica, Ceylon, Australia and Canada) 

decided either by the Privy Council or the highest courts of the concerned 

countries, is fully applicable to India as well. In order to demonstrate this, he 

placed reliance on State of Maharashtra v. Labour Law Practitioners' 

Association, (1998) 2 SCC 688. The controversy in the cited case originated with 

the filing of a writ petition by the respondent Association challenging the 

appointment of Assistant Commissioners of Labour (i.e., Officers discharging 

executive functions under the Labour Department). The above appointments 

had been made, consequent upon amendments to the provisions of the Bombay 

Industrial Relations Act, and the Industrial Disputes (Maharashtra Amendment) 

Act. The submission advanced at the hands of the respondent Association was, 

that Labour Courts had been constituted in the State of Maharashtra, under the 

Industrial Disputes Act, the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, as also, the 

Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour 

Practices, Act. Qualifications of persons to be appointed as a judge of the 

Labour Court under the Industrial Disputes Act, was stipulated in Section 7, 

which provided as under:-

60 


Page 61 

"(a) that he was or had been a Judge of a High Court; or 
(b) 
that he had for a period of not less than three years been a District 
Judge or an Additional District Judge; or 
(c) 
that he had held the office of the Chairman or any other Member of 
the Labour Appellate Tribunal or of any Tribunal for a period of not less 
than two years; or 
(d) 
that he had held any judicial office in India for not less than seven 
years; or 
(e) 
that he had been the Presiding Officer of a Labour Court constituted 
under any provincial Act for not less than five years." 

By the Industrial Disputes (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 1974, Section 7 was 

amended, and three more sources of recruitment for the post of judge of the 

Labour Court were added. These were:-

"(d-1) 
he has practiced as an advocate or attorney for not less than 
seven years in the High Court, or any court, subordinate thereto, or any 
Industrial Court or Tribunal or Labour Court, constituted under any law for 
the time being in force; or 
(d-2) 
he holds a degree in law of a University established by law in any 
part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in rank than that 
of a Deputy Registrar of any such Industrial Court or Tribunal for not less 
than five years; or 
(d-3) 
he holds a degree in law of University established by law in any 
part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in rank than that 
of Assistant Commissioner of Labour under the State Government for not 
less than five years." 

Under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, as it originally stood, Section 9 

provided, that only such persons would be eligible for appointment as a judge of 

the Labour Court, who possessed the qualifications laid down under Article 234 

of the Constitution, for being eligible to enter judicial service in the State of 

Maharashtra. By the Maharashtra Act 47 of 1977, Section 9 of the Bombay 

Industrial Relations Act was amended by substituting a new sub-section (2), 

which replaced the original sub-section (2) of Section 9. The amended sub-

section (2) was as follows:-

61 


Page 62 

"9. 
(2) 
A person shall not be qualified for appointment as the 
presiding officer of a Labour Court, unless: 
(a) 
he has held any judicial office in India for not less than five 
years; or 
(b) 
he has practiced as an Advocate or Attorney for not less than 
seven years in the High Court or any court subordinate thereto, or in 
any Industrial Court, Tribunal or Labour Court constituted under any 
law for the time being in force; or 
(c) 
he holds a degree in law of a University established by law in 
any part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in 
rank than that of Deputy Registrar of any such Industrial Court or 
Tribunal, or of Assistant Commissioner of Labour under the State 
Government, in both cases for not less than five years." 

In the first instance, this Court for the first time declared the salient components 

of the functions exercised by a civil court , as under:-

"6. 
In the case of The Bharat Bank Ltd. v. Employees, AIR 1950 SC 
188, this Court considered whether an Industrial Tribunal was a court. It 
said that one cannot go by mere nomenclature. One has to examine the 
functions of a Tribunal and how it proceeds to discharge those functions. It 
held that an Industrial Tribunal had all the trappings of a court and 
performed functions which cannot but be regarded as judicial. The Court 
referred to the Rules by which proceedings before the Tribunal were 
regulated. The Court dwelt on the fact that the powers vested in it are 
similar to those exercised by civil courts under the Code of Civil Procedure 
when trying a suit. It had the power of ordering discovery, inspection etc. 
and forcing the attendance of witnesses, compelling production of 
documents and so on. It gave its decision on the basis of evidence and in 
accordance with law. Applying the test laid down in the case of Cooper v. 
Wilson, (1937) 2 K.B. 309 at p.340, this Court said that "a true judicial 
decision presupposes an existence of dispute between two or more parties 
and then involves four requisites -(1) the presentation of their case by the 
parties; (2) ascertainment of facts by means of evidence adduced by the 
parties often with the assistance of argument; (3) if the dispute relates to a 
question of law, submission of legal arguments by the parties; and (4) by 
decision which disposes of the whole matter by findings on fact and 
application of law to facts so found. Judged by the same tests, a Labour 
Court would undoubtedly be a court in the true sense of the term. The 
question, however, is whether such a court and the presiding officer of 
such a court can be said to hold a post in the judicial service of the State 
as defined in Article 236 of the Constitution." 

62 


Page 63 

The other relevant observations recorded in the above cited judgment are 

reproduced below:-

"13. Reliance has been placed upon this judgment as showing that 
judicial service is interpreted narrowly to cover only the hierarchy of civil 
courts headed by the District Judge. This Court, however, was not 
considering the position of other civil courts, in the context of the extensive 
definition given to the term "district judge". This Court was concerned with 
preserving independence of the judiciary from the executive and making 
sure that persons from non-judicial services, such as, the police, excise or 
revenue were not considered as eligible for appointment as District 
Judges. That is why the emphasis is on the fact that the judicial service 
should consist exclusively of judicial officers. This judgment should not be 
interpreted narrowly to exclude from judicial service new hierarchies of civil 
courts being set up which are headed by a judge who can be considered 
as a District Judge bearing in mind the extensive definition of that term in 
Article 236. 
14. The High Court has, therefore, correctly interpreted the observations of 
this Court in Chandra Mohan vs. State of U.P., AIR 1966 SC 1987, as 
giving paramount importance to the enforcement of the constitutional 
scheme providing for independence of the judiciary. The concern of the 
court was to see that this independence was not destroyed by an indirect 
method. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
18. In the case of Shri Kumar Padma Prasad v. Union of India & Ors., 
(1992) 2 SCC 428, this Court had to consider qualifications for the purpose 
of appointment as a Judge of the High Court under Article 217 of the 
Constitution. While interpreting the expression "judicial office" under Article 
217(2)(a), this Court held that the expression "judicial office" must be 
interpreted in consonance with the scheme of Chapters V and VI of Part VI 
of the Constitution. So construed it means a judicial office which belongs to 
the judicial service as defined under Article 236(b). Therefore, in order to 
qualify for appointment as a judge of a High Court, a person must hold a 
judicial office which must be a part of the judicial service of the State. After 
referring to the cases of Chandra Mohan (supra) and Statesman (Private) 
Ltd. vs. H.R. Deb, AIR 1968 SC 1495, this Court said that the term "judicial 
office" in its generic sense may include a wide variety of offices which are 
connected with the administration of justice in one way or the other. 
Officers holding various posts under the executive are often vested with 
magisterial power to meet a particular situation. The Court said, 
"Did the framers of the Constitution have this type of 'offices' in mind 
when they provided a source of appointment to the high office, of a 
judge of the High Court from amongst the holders of a 'judicial 
office'? The answer, has to be in the negative. We are of the view 

63 


Page 64 

that holder of judicial office under Article 217(2)(a) means the person 
who exercises only judicial functions, determines causes inter-
parties and renders decisions in a judicial capacity. He must belong 
to the judicial service which as a class is free from executive control 
and is disciplined to uphold the dignity, integrity and independence 
of the judiciary." 
Going by these tests laid down as to what constitutes judicial service under 
Article 236 of the Constitution, the Labour Court judges and the judges of 
the Industrial Court can be held to belong to judicial service. The hierarchy 
contemplated in the case of Labour Court judges is the hierarchy of Labour 
Court judges and Industrial Court judges with the Industrial Court judges 
holding the superior position of District Judges. The Labour Courts have 
also been held as subject to the High Court's power of superintendence 
under Article 227. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
20. The constitutional scheme under Chapter V of Part VI dealing with 
the High Courts and Chapter VI of Part VI dealing with the subordinate 
courts shows a clear anxiety on the part of the framers of the Constitution 
to preserve and promote independence of the judiciary from the executive. 
Thus Article 233 which deals with appointment of District Judges requires 
that such appointments shall be made by the Governor of the State in 
consultation with the High Court. Article 233(2) has been interpreted as 
prescribing that "a person in the service of the Union or the State" can 
refer only to a person in the judicial service of the Union or the State. 
Article 234 which deals with recruitment of persons other than District 
Judges to the judicial service requires that their appointments can be made 
only in accordance with the Rules framed by the Governor of the State 
after consultation with the State Public Service Commission and with the 
High Court. Article 235 provides that the control over district courts and 
courts subordinate thereto shall be vested in the High Court; and Article 
236 defines the expression "District Judge" extensively as covering judges 
of a City Civil Court etc. as earlier set out, and the expression "judicial 
service" as meaning a service consisting exclusively of persons intended 
to fill the post of the District Judge and other civil judicial posts inferior to 
the post of District Judge. Therefore, bearing in mind the principle of 
separation of powers and independence of the judiciary, judicial service 
contemplates a service exclusively of judicial posts in which there will be a 
hierarchy headed by a District Judge. The High Court has rightly come to 
the conclusion that the persons presiding over Industrial and Labour 
Courts would constitute a judicial service so defined. Therefore, the 
recruitment of Labour Court judges is required to be made in accordance 
with Article 234 of the Constitution." 

25. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, the judgments and 

text cited hereinabove, are fully applicable on the subject of administration of 

64 


Page 65 

justice through courts in India. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is 

concerned, learned counsel placed reliance on Article 50 of the Constitution, 

which is reproduced hereunder:-

"50. Separation of judiciary from executive -The State shall take steps to 
separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services of the 
State." 

Based on Article 50 aforementioned, it was the contention of the learned counsel 

for the petitioners, that the Constitution itself mandates a separate judicial 

hierarchy of courts distinct from the executive. 

26. Coupled with the above mandate, it was the contention of the learned 

counsel for the petitioners, that the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the 

Customs Act, and the Excise Act prior to independence of this country, and even 

thereafter, vested the High Courts with an exclusive jurisdiction to settle 

"questions of law" emerging out of tax disputes. It was further contended, that 

even after the enforcement of the Constitution, with effect from 26.11.1949, the 

adjudicatory power to decide substantial questions of law, continued to be 

vested in the High Courts, inasmuch as, the jurisdictional High Courts continued 

to exercise appellate jurisdiction. The position has remained unaltered till date. 

It is, therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that 

historically, constitutionally and legally, the appellate jurisdiction in direct/indirect 

tax matters, has remained with the High Courts, and it is not permissible either by 

way of an amendment to the Constitution itself, or by enacting a legislation, to 

transfer the said appellate jurisdiction exercised by the High Courts to a quasi-

judicial tribunal. 

65 


Page 66 

The third contention: 

27. In the course of the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the 

petitioners on the third contention, wherein it was sought to be submitted, that 

"separation of powers", the "rule of law" and "judicial review" constitute amongst 

others, the "basic structure" of the Constitution, it was submitted, that Article 

323B inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 was 

violative of the above mentioned components of the basic structure of the 

Constitution. Article 323B is being extracted hereunder:-

"323B. 
Tribunals for other matters -(1) The appropriate Legislature 
may, by law, provide for the adjudication or trial by tribunals of any 
disputes, complaints, or offences with respect to all or any of the matters 
specified in clause (2) with respect to which such Legislature has power to 
make laws. 
(2) 
The matters referred to in clause (1) are the following, namely:-
(a) levy, assessment, collection and enforcement of any tax; 
(b) foreign exchange, import and export across customs frontiers; 
(c) industrial and labour disputes; 
(d) land reforms by way of acquisition by the State of any estate as 
defined in article 31A or of any rights therein or the extinguishment 
or modification of any such rights or by way of ceiling on agricultural 
land or in any other way; 
(e) ceiling on urban property; 
(f) elections to either House of Parliament or the House or either 
House of the Legislature of a State, but excluding the matters 
referred to in article 329 and article 329A; 
(g) production, procurement, supply and distribution of foodstuffs 
(including edible oilseeds and oils) and such other goods as the 
President may, by public notification, declare to be essential goods 
for the purpose of this article and control of prices of such goods; 
(h) rent, its regulation and control and tenancy issues including the 
rights, title and interest of landlords and tenants; 
(i) offences against laws with respect to any of the matters specified 
in sub-clauses (a) to (h) and fees in respect of any of those matters; 
(j) any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in sub-
clauses (a) to (i). 
(3) 
A law made under clause (1) may-
(a) provide for the establishment of a hierarchy of tribunals; 

66 


Page 67 

(b) specify the jurisdiction, powers (including the power to punish for 
contempt) and authority which may be exercised by each of the said 
tribunals; 
(c) provide for the procedure (including provisions as to limitation 
and rules of evidence) to be followed by the said tribunals; 
(d) exclude the jurisdiction of all courts except the jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court under article 136, with respect to all or any of the 
matters falling within the jurisdiction of the said tribunals; 
(e) provide for the transfer to each such tribunal of any cases 
pending before any court or any other authority immediately before 
the establishment of such tribunal as would have been within the 
jurisdiction of such tribunal if the causes of action on which such 
suits or proceedings are based had arisen after such establishment; 
(f) contain such supplemental, incidental and consequential 
provisions (including provisions as to fees) as the appropriate 
Legislature may deem necessary for the effective functioning of, and 
for the speedy disposal of cases by, and the enforcement of the 
orders of, such tribunals. 
(4) The provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything 
in any other provision of this Constitution or in any other law for the time 
being in force. 
Explanation.-In this article, "appropriate Legislature", in relation to any 
matter, means Parliament or, as the case may be, a State Legislature 
competent to make laws with respect to such matter in accordance with 
the provisions of Part XI." 

Insofar as the aforesaid provision is concerned it was submitted, that Clause (3) 

of Article 323B clearly violated all the above mentioned ingredients of the "basic 

structure" theory. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that establishment 

of a hierarchy of tribunals implicitly led to the inference, that the existing judicial 

process, where adjudication was before a court of law, was to be substituted in 

its entirety. Thereby, even the existing appellate process which was vested in 

High Courts was sought to be substituted by tribunals. It was submitted, that 

creation of a parallel judicial system, was alien to the provisions of the 

Constitution, which recognized the judiciary as an independent component, 

separate from the executive and the legislature. It was accordingly vehemently 

67 


Page 68 

asserted, that the process of justice was being substituted, by tribunalization of 

justice, which was clearly unacceptable under the Constitution. Sub-clause (d) of 

Article 323B(3), according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, divested 

jurisdiction vested in all civil courts for the adjudication of the matters on the 

subjects referred to in Article 323B(2), including not only the appellate jurisdiction 

of High Courts, but also, the power of "judicial review" vested in High Courts 

under Articles 226 and 227, of the Constitution. It was also the contention of the 

learned counsel for the petitioners, that despite decisions rendered by this Court, 

the legislature has repeated and reiterated what had been found to be 

unsustainable in law. 

28. While canvassing the aforesaid contention learned counsel for the 

petitioners pointed out, that the above mentioned Article 323B was introduced by 

the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, which was part of an 

overall scheme, to drastically curtail the power of "judicial review" vested with the 

higher judiciary. It was pointed out, that all other objectionable provisions were 

deleted, and powers earlier vested in superior courts were restored. However, 

Part XIV A of the Constitution, inserting Articles 323A and 323B was allowed to 

remain. It was submitted that Articles 323A and 323B, enabled the creation of 

parallel judiciary under executive control. In order to support his aforestated 

contention, learned counsel invited the Court's attention to the expressions 

"adjudication or trial", "disputes, complaints or offences", "transfer of suits or 

proceedings", etc. which could be fashioned in a manner different from that which 

presently prevailed. It was pointed out, that the aforestated mandate contained 

68 


Page 69 

in Article 323B of the Constitution, was incompatible with the "basic structure" of 

the Constitution, which mandates "separation of powers". 

29. In view of the aforementioned submissions, it was the vehement 

contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that Article 323B(4) should 

be struck down. It was submitted, that if the instant prayer of the petitioners does 

not find favour with this Court, the alternative prayer of the petitioners was, that 

Article 323B must be purposefully interpreted, so as to bestow equivalence 

commensurate to the Court sought to be substituted by the tribunal. It was 

submitted, that it was imperative to provide for measures to ensure 

independence in the functioning of tribunals substituting functions carried out by 

courts. This could be done, according to learned counsel for the petitioners, by 

extending the conditions of service applicable to judges of the court sought to be 

substituted. In order to support his aforestated contention, learned counsel for 

the petitioners placed reliance on judgments rendered by this Court, laying down 

the limits and parameters within which such tribunals could be created. Despite 

the declaration of law by this Court it was submitted, that the NTT Act, has been 

enacted, which suffers from the same vices, which had already been found to be 

unconstitutional. For reasons of brevity, it is considered inappropriate, to refer to 

all the judgments relied upon by the rival parties on the instant issue. Suffice it to 

state, that the same will be examined, only while recording conclusions. 

The fourth contention: 

30. While advancing the fourth contention, learned counsel for the petitioners 

referred to various provisions of the NTT Act, which would have the effect of 

69 


Page 70 

compromising the independence of the NTT. We may briefly refer to the 

provisions of the said Act, highlighted by the learned counsel for the petitioners, 

during the course of hearing, as under:-

(i) 
First and foremost, reference was made to Section 5 of the NTT Act. The 

same is being extracted hereunder:-

"5. 
Constitution and jurisdiction of Benches-(1) the jurisdiction of the 
National Tax Tribunal may be exercised by the Benches thereof to be 
constituted by the Chairperson. 
(2) 
The Benches of the National Tax Tribunal shall ordinarily sit at any 
place in the National Capital Territory of Delhi or such other places as the 
Central Government may, in consultation with the Chairperson, notify: 
Provided that the Chairperson may for adequate reasons permit a 
Bench to hold its temporary sitting for a period not exceeding fifteen days 
at a place other than its ordinary place of seat. 
(3) 
The Central Government shall notify the areas in relation to which 
each bench of the National Tax Tribunal may exercise its jurisdiction. 
(4) 
The Central Government shall determine the number of Benches 
and each Bench shall consist of two members. 
(5) 
The Central Government may transfer a Member from headquarters 
of one Bench in one State to the headquarters of another Bench in another 
State or to the headquarters of any other Bench within a State: 
Provided that no member shall be transferred without the concurrence of 
the Chairperson." 

Referring to sub-section (2) of Section 5 it was sought to be asserted, that 

benches of the NTT are ordinarily to function in the National Capital Territory of 

Delhi. This, according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, would deprive 

the litigating assessee, the convenience of approaching the High Court of the 

State to which he belongs. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that in 

every tax related dispute, there is an asseessee on one side, and the Revenue 

on the other. Accordingly, if the NTT is mandated to sit ordinarily in the National 

Capital Territory of Delhi, assessees from far flung States would have to suffer 

extreme hardship for the redressal of their grievance, especially at the appellate 

70 


Page 71 

stage. Besides the hardships, it was pointed out, that each asseessee would be 

subjected to unfathomable financial expense. Referring to sub-section (5) of 

Section 5 of the NTT Act, it was the submission of the learned counsel for the 

petitioners, that the Central Government was vested with the power to transfer a 

Member from the headquarters of one bench in one State, to the headquarters of 

another bench in another State. It was also open to the Central Government to 

transfer a Member from one bench to another bench in the same State. It was 

submitted, that in case of High Courts, such power is exercised exclusively by 

the Chief Justice, in the best interest of the administration of justice. It was 

submitted, that the Central Government, which is a stakeholder, could exercise 

the above power of transfer for harassment and exploitation of sitting Members of 

the NTT. In other words, an inconvenient Member could be moved away, and 

replaced by one who would tow the desired line. 

(ii) 
Likewise, learned counsel for the petitioners referred to Section 6 of the 

NTT Act to demonstrate, that the same would also have an undermining effect on 

the adjudicatory process. Section 6 of the NTT Act is reproduced hereunder:-

"6. 
Qualifications for appointment of Chairperson and other Members -
(1) 
The Chairperson of the National Tax Tribunal shall be a person who 
has been a Judge of the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice of a High 
Court. 
(2) 
A person shall not be qualified for appointment as Member unless 
he-
(a) 
is, or has been, or is eligible to be, a Judge of a High Court; or 
(b) 
is, or has been, a Member of the Income-tax Appellate 
Tribunal or of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate 
Tribunal for at least five years." 

Learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out, that sub-section (2), 

aforementioned, laid down the qualifications for appointment as Member of the 

71 


Page 72 

NTT. Referring to clause (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the NTT Act it was 

submitted, that a person who is eligible to be a judge of a High Court, is to be 

treated as eligible as a member of the NTT. Inviting our attention to Article 217 

of the Constitution it was submitted, that a person who is a citizen of India and 

has, for at least 10 years, practiced as an Advocate before one or the other High 

Court, has been treated as eligible for being appointed as a Member of the NTT. 

Referring to Section 8 of the NTT Act it was pointed out, that a Member of the 

NTT is provided with a tenure of five years, from the date of his appointment as 

Member of the NTT. It was pointed out, that in terms of Article 217 of the 

Constitution, a person would easily become eligible for appointment as a judge at 

or around the age of 35-40 years, and as such, if he is assured a tenure of only 

five years, it would not be possible for him to discharge his duties without fear or 

favour, inasmuch as, he would always have a larking uncertainty in his mind 

about his future, after the expiry of the prescribed term of five years, in the event 

of not being granted an extension. Relying on clause (b) of Section 6(2) of the 

NTT Act, it was also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners, 

that Members of the Appellate Tribunals constituted under the Income Tax Act, 

the Customs Act, and the Excise Act, are also eligible for being appointed as 

Members of the NTT. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that there are 

Accountant Members of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, who too would 

become eligible for appointment as Members of the NTT. It was submitted, that 

judicial experience on the niceties of law, specially on the different aspects, 

which need to be dealt with while adjudicating tax matters, would be alien to 

72 


Page 73 

them, inasmuch as they can only be experts on the subject of accountancy. It 

was pointed out, that the jurisdiction vested in the NTT, is an alternative 

jurisdiction to that of the High Court, and as such, it is difficult to appreciate how 

an Accountant Member of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal can be expected to 

discharge duties relating to settling substantial questions of law in the manner 

judges of the High Court dispense with the aforesaid responsibilities. 

(iii) Learned counsel for the petitioners then invited our attention to Section 7 

of the NTT Act. The said section is reproduced hereunder:-

"7. 
Appointment of Chairperson and other Members -(1) Subject to 
the provisions of sub-section (2), the Chairperson and every other Member 
shall be appointed by the Central Government. 
(2) 
The Chairperson and the other Members shall be appointed by the 
Central Government on the recommendations of a Selection Committee 
consisting of-
(a) 
the Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the Supreme Court 
nominated by him; 
(b) 
the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice (Department 
of Legal Affairs); 
(c) 
the Secretary in the Ministry of Finance (Department of 
Revenue). 
(3) 
No appointment of the Chairperson or of any other Member shall be 
invalidated merely by reason of any vacancy or any defect in the 
constitution of the Selection Committee." 

A perusal of sub-section (2) of Section 7 reveals the composition of the selection 

committee for selection of the Chairperson and Members of the NTT. It was 

sought to be pointed out, that there were two representatives of the executive, 

out of three member selection committee, and only one member in the selection 

committee was from the judiciary. Accordingly it was asserted, that the two 

representatives belonging to the executive would control the outcome of every 

selection process. Since the NTT was, an alternative to the jurisdiction earlier 

73 


Page 74 

vested with the High Court, it was submitted, that the same process of selection, 

as was prevalent for appointment of judges of the High Court, should be adopted 

for selection of Chairperson and Members of the NTT. All that is imperative and 

essential is, that the selection process should be the same, as is in place, for the 

court sought to be substituted. It was also the contention of the learned counsel 

for the petitioners, that a provision similar to Section 7(2) of the NTT Act, had 

been struck down by this Court, in State of Maharashtra v. Labour Law 

Practitioners' Association (supra). 

(iv) Learned counsel for the petitioners then invited our attention to Section 8 

of the NTT Act. Section 8 is being reproduced hereunder:-

"8. 
Terms of office of Chairperson and other Members -The 
Chairperson and every other Member shall hold office as such for a term of 
five years from the date on which he enters upon his office but shall be 
eligible for re-appointment: 
Provided that no Chairperson or other Member shall hold office as 
such after he has attained, -
(a) 
in the case of Chairperson, the age of sixty-eight years; and 
(b) 
in the case of any other Member, the age of sixty-five years." 

According to learned counsel, a perusal of Section 8 reveals, that a Chairperson 

and a Member of the NTT would hold office for a term of five years, from the date 

of his/her appointment to the NTT. It was, however sought to be pointed out, that 

a person appointed as such, is clearly eligible for reappointment. It was sought 

to be asserted, that a provision for reappointment, would itself have the effect of 

undermining the independence of the Members of the NTT. It was sought to be 

asserted, that each one of the appointees to the NTT would be prompted to 

appease the Revenue, so as to solicit reappointment contemplated under 

Section 8 of the NTT Act. In this behalf it was submitted, that the tenure of 

74 


Page 75 

appointment to a tribunal, which is to substitute a High Court, should be akin to 

that of a judge of High Court. 

(v) 
Our attention was then invited to Section 13 of the NTT Act, which is 

reproduced hereunder:-

"13. Appearance before National Tax Tribunal -(1) A party to an 
appeal other than Government may either appear in person or authorize 
one or more chartered accountants or legal practitioners to present his or 
its case before the National Tax Tribunal. 
(2) 
The Government may authorize one or more legal practitioners or 
any of its officers to present its case before the National Tax Tribunal. 
Explanation -For the purposes of this Section,-
(a) 
"chartered accountant" means a chartered accountant as 
defined in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Chartered 
Accountants Act, 1949 (38 of 1949) and who has obtained a 
certificate of practice under sub-section (1) of section 6 of that Act; 
(b) 
"legal practitioner" means an advocate, a vakil or any attorney 
of any High Court, and includes a pleader in practice." 

It was submitted, that besides allowing the assessee to represent himself before 

the NTT, Section 13 allows him to be represented through one or more 

Chartered Accountants or legal practitioners. Thus far, according to learned 

counsel for the petitioners, there seemed to be no difficulty in Section 13(1) of the 

NTT Act. However, allowing "any person duly authorized" by the assessee to 

represent him before the NTT, is clearly ununderstandable. It was submitted, 

that the main function of the NTT would be to settle substantial questions of law 

on tax issues, and as such, under Section 13(1), it would be open to an assessee 

to engage an individual to represent him, even though he is totally unqualified in 

the fields on which the adjudicatory process is to be conducted. Likewise, it is 

the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, besides legal 

practitioners, the Revenue is allowed to be represented through any of its 

75 


Page 76 

officers. It was sought to be asserted, that an understanding of the text of the 

provision is one thing, whereas interpreting it in the contemplated context, quite 

another. As such, it was submitted, that officers of the Revenue, who lack in 

interpretative skills, would be wholly unsuited for representing the Revenue 

before the NTT. 

Submissions in opposition, by the respondents/interveners: 

The first contention: 

31. In response to the first contention, namely, that the reasons for setting up 

the NTT were fallacious and non-existent, and as such, the legislative enactment 

under reference creating the NTT as an independent appellate forum to decide 

appeals on "substantial questions" of law, from orders passed by the Appellate 

Tribunals constituted under the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act, and the Excise 

Act deserves to be set aside; it was the contention of the learned counsel for the 

respondents, that the submissions advanced at the hands of the petitioners, were 

premised on an improper understanding of the factual background. In this 

behalf, it is sought to be asserted, that the tax receipts are the primary source of 

revenue in India. The Government of India meets its budgetary requirements 

from revenue receipts. It is sought to be explained, that tax is collected by an 

established administrative and legal structure. On the one hand, while fastening 

of a tax liability would reduce the profits of an assessee, it would enhance the 

revenue receipts of the Government. On the other hand, exemption from a tax 

76 


Page 77 

liability would increase profits of an assessee, but would reduce the revenue 

receipts of the Government. In view of the above profit and loss scenario, 

administration of tax loss, has an inherent tendency to result in disputes and 

litigation. The process of litigation is primarily based on adoption of innovative 

means of interpretation of law, both by the revenue and by the tax payers. As a 

result, significant amount of time is spent, on long drawn litigation, wherein tax 

payers and the Government lock horns against one another. Naturally, this 

impacts revenue earnings as levy of tax of thousands of crores of rupees, 

remains embroiled in such litigation. It was sought to be pointed out, that as per 

the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Database, Indian companies have a 

vast amount locked in disputed taxes. As per the above report, during the 

Financial Year 2011-2012; 30 companies that make up the Bombay Stock 

Exchange sensex, had money locked in disputed taxes estimated at Rs.42,388 

crores. The above disputed tax liability, according to the learned counsel for the 

respondents, was a 27% increase from the amount of the preceding year, which 

was estimated at Rs.33,339 crores. 

32. In respect of disputes on direct taxes, it was submitted, that in a written 

reply submitted by the Minster of State for Finance, the Lok Sabha was informed 

in April, 2012, that 5,943 tax cases were pending with the Supreme Court, and 

30,213 direct tax cases were pending with High Courts. It was submitted that the 

Lok Sabha was additionally informed, that the disputed amount of tax, at various 

levels, was estimated at Rs.4,36,741 crores, as on 31.12.2011. It was further 

sought to be asserted, that in the preceding year, the estimate in respect of the 

77 


Page 78 

disputed amount at various levels, was to the tune of Rs.2,43,603 crores. 

Accordingly it was sought to be pointed out, that with each succeeding year, not 

only the tax related litigation was being progressively enhanced, there was also a 

significant increase in the finance blocked in such matters. 

33. It was likewise pointed out, that the number of cases involving levy of 

indirect taxes, projected a similar unfortunate reflection. In this behalf, it was 

sought to be pointed out, that as on 31.12.2012, the number of pending customs 

disputes were approximately 17,800, wherein an amount of approximately 

Rs.7,400 crores was involved. Insofar as the number of pending central excise 

cases as on 31.10.2012 is concerned, the figure was approximately 19,800 and 

the amount involved was approximately Rs.21,450 crores. By adding the figures 

reflected hereinabove, in respect of the disputes pertaining to indirect taxes, it 

was suggested that a total of about 37,600 cases were pending, involving an 

amount of approximately Rs.28,850 crores. Additionally it was submitted, that 

out of the 17,800 customs cases, approximately 6,300 cases had been pending 

for adjudication for periods ranging from one to three years, and approximately 

2,800 customs cases had been pending adjudication for over three years. 

Likewise, out of the 19,800 central excise cases, 1,600 cases were pending for 

decision for a period between one to three years; and 240 cases had been 

pending for decision for over three years. 

34. It was pointed out at the behest of the respondents, that several reasons 

contributed to the prolonged continuation of tax disputes. The main reason 

however was, that there was a lack of clarity in law in tax litigation. It was 

78 


Page 79 

submitted, that the above lack of clarity resulted in multiple interpretations. 

Added to that, according to the learned counsel for the respondents, existence of 

multiple appellate levels, and independent jurisdictional High Courts, resulted in 

the existence of conflicting opinions at various appellate forums across the 

country, contributing in unfathomable delay and multiplicity of proceedings. 

35. Based on the factors narrated above, it was the submission of the learned 

counsel for the respondents, that the burden of high volume of disputes had had 

the effect of straining the adjudicatory, as well as, the judicial system. It was 

pointed out, that the judicial system was already heavily burdened by the weight 

of significant number of unresolved cases. It was submitted, that the addition of 

cases each year, added not only to the inconvenience of the taxpayer, but also to 

the revenue earned by the government. It was pointed out, that the instant state 

of affairs created an uncertain and destabilized business environment, with 

taxpayers not being able to budget, for tax costs. Importantly such uncertainty, 

according to the learned counsel, emerged out of the two factors. Firstly, the law 

itself was complex, and therefore, uncertain. And secondly, for an interpretation 

of the law to achieve a degree of certainty at the Supreme Court level, required 

several rounds of litigation. It was submitted, that in view of the above, the 

current scenario called for reforms in the dispute resolution mechanism, and the 

introduction of, conscious practices and procedures, aimed at limiting the 

initiation, as well as, the prolongation of tax disputes. It is, therefore, the 

submission of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the assertions made 

79 


Page 80 

at the hands of the petitioners, while projecting the first contention, were wholly 

misconceived, and as such, are liable to be rejected. 

The second contention: 

36. In response to the second contention, namely, that it is impermissible for 

the legislature to abrogate the core judicial appellate functions, traditionally 

vested with the High Court, or that it is impermissible to vest the same with an 

independent, parallel quasi-judicial hierarchy of tribunals, it was submitted, that 

the petitioners had not been able to appreciate the matter in its correct 

perspective. It was pointed out, that the NTT Act is a legislation which creates an 

appellate forum, in a hierarchy of fora, as a remedy for ventilation of grievances 

emerging out of taxing statutes. To fully appreciate the purport of the special 

remedy created by the statute, the nature of the right and/or the liability created 

by the taxing statutes, and the enforcement for which these remedies have been 

provided, needed to be understood in the correct perspective. Accordingly, in 

order to debate the rightful cause, learned counsel drew our attention to the 

proposition, in the manner, as was understood by the respondents. The 

submissions advanced in this behalf are being summarized hereinafter. 

37. It was the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the 

Income Tax Act, the Customs Act, and the Excise Act, as also, other taxing 

statutes create a statutory liability. The said statutory liability has no existence, 

de hors the statute itself. The said statutory liability, has no existence in common 

law. It was further submitted, that it had been long well settled, that where a right 

to plead liability had no existence in common law, but was the creation of a 

80 


Page 81 

statute, which simultaneously provided for a special and particular remedy for 

enforcing it, the remedy provided by the statute was bound to be followed. In 

respect of such statutory liability, it was not competent for the party to proceed, 

by action at common law. In this behalf, our attention was invited to the 

observations recorded by this Court in Dhulabhai v. State of M.P. (1968) 3 SCR 

662 wherein the Court observed as under: 

"9. The question that arises in these appeals has been before this Court 
in relation to other statutes and has been answered in different ways. 
These appeals went before a Divisional Bench of this Court but in view of 
the difficulty presented by the earlier rulings of this Court, they were 
referred to the Constitution Bench and that is how they are before us. At 
the very start we may observe that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is all 
embracing except to the extent it is excluded by an express provision of 
law or by clear intendment arising from such law. This is the purport of 
Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. How Section 9 operates is 
perhaps best illustrated by referring to the categories of cases, mentioned 
by 
Willes,J. 
in 
Wolverhampton 
New 
Waterworks 
Co. v. 
Hawkesford, [1859] 6 C.B. (NS) 336 -They are : 
"One is where there was a liability existing at common law, and that 
liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar 
form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common 
law: there, unless the statute contains words which expressly or by 
necessary implication exclude the common law remedy the party 
suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy. 
The second class of cases is, where the statue gives the right to sue 
merely, but provides, no particular form of remedy: there, the party 
can only proceed by action at common law. But there is a third class, 
viz., where a liability not existing at common law is created by a 
statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy 
for enforcing it.........The remedy provided by the statute must be 
followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course 
applicable to cases of the second class." 
This view of Willes, J. was accepted by the House of Lords in Neville v. 
London 'Express' Newspaper Ltd., [1919] A.C. 368. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
35. Neither of the two cases of Firm of Illuri Subayya or Kamla Mills can 
be said to run counter to the series of cases earlier noticed. The result of 
this inquiry into the diverse views expressed in this Court may be stated 
as follows :-

81 


Page 82 

(1) Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special 
tribunals the Civil Courts' jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if 
there is adequate remedy to do what the Civil Courts would normally 
do in a suit. Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases 
where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied 
with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the 
fundamental principles of judicial procedure. 
(2) Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the court, an 
examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy 
or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is 
not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court. 
Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the 
remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the 
intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be 
decisive. In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates 
a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the 
right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the 
said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so 
constituted, and whether remedies normally associated with actions 
in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said statue or not. 
(3) Challenge to the provisions of the particular Act as ultra vires 
cannot be brought before Tribunals constituted under that Act. Even 
the High Court cannot go into that question on a revision or 
reference from the decision of the Tribunals. 
(4) When a provision is already declared unconstitutional or the 
constitutionality of any provision is to be challenged, a suit is open. A 
writ of certiorari may include a direction for refund if the claim is 
clearly within the time prescribed by the Limitation Act but it is not a 
compulsory remedy to replace a suit. 
(5) Where the particular Act contains no machinery for refund of tax 
collected in excess of constitutional limits or illegally collected a suit 
lies. 
(6) Questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its 
constitutionality are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit 
does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or 
there is an express prohibition in the particular Act. In either case the 
scheme of the particular Act must be examined because it is a 
relevant enquiry. 
(7) An exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not readily to 
be inferred unless the conditions above set down apply." 

38. In addition to the above submissions, it was sought to be asserted that the 

Income Tax Act expressly barred the jurisdiction of civil courts. Reference in this 

82 


Page 83 

behalf was made to Section 293 of the Income Tax Act, which is being extracted 

hereunder: 

"293. Bar of suits in civil courts. -No suit shall be brought in any civil court 
to set aside or modify any proceeding taken or order made under this Act, 
and no prosecution, suit or other proceeding shall lie against the 
Government or any officer of the Government for anything in good faith 
done or intended to be done under this Act." 

39. It has been further held by this Court following the dictum at Barraclough v. 

Brown (1897) AC 615, that if a statute confers a right and in the same breath 

provides for enforcement of such right the remedy provided by such a statute is 

an exclusive one. Applying this doctrine, in Premier Automobiles v. Kamlekar 

Shantaram Wadke, (1976) 1 SCC 496 at 513, this Court held as under: 

"23. To sum up, the principles applicable to the jurisdiction of the Civil 
Court in relation to an industrial dispute may be stated thus: 
(1) If the dispute is not an industrial dispute, nor does it relate to 
enforcement of any other right under the Act the remedy lies only in the 
civil Court. 
(2) If the dispute is an industrial dispute arising out of a right or liability 
under the general or common law and not under the Act, the jurisdiction of 
the civil Court is alternative, leaving it to the election of the suitor 
concerned to choose his remedy for the relief which is competent to be 
granted in a particular remedy. 
(3) If the industrial dispute relates to the enforcement of a right or an 
obligation created under the Act, then the only remedy available to the 
suitor is to get an adjudication under the Act. 
(4) If the right which is sought to be enforced is a right created under the 
Act such as Chapter VA then the remedy for its enforcement is either 
Section 33C or the raising of an industrial dispute, as the case may be ." 

In paragraph 12 of the Premier Automobiles case (supra), this Court quoted the 

words of Lord Watson in Barraclough v. Brown (supra) to the following effect: 

"the right and the remedy are given uno flatu and the one cannot be 
disassociated from the other" 

83 


Page 84 

40. It is for this reason, according to learned counsel for the respondents, that 

civil courts, even the High Court having original jurisdiction, would not entertain 

suits on matters covered by such special statutes creating rights and providing 

remedies. [See Argosam Finance Co. Ltd. v. Oxby (1964) 1 All E.R. 791 at 796-

H]. 

"The principle underlying those passages seem to me to be applicable to 
the present case Section 341 of the Income Tax Act, 1952, confers the 
right, the right to an adjustment tax liability by reference to loss; that right 
does not exist independently of the section; the section uno flatu in the 
breath gives a specific remedy and appoints a specific tribunal for its 
enforcement, namely the General Commission or Special Commissioners. 
In those circumstances in my judgment, the taxpayer must resort to that 
remedy and that tribunal. In due course if dissatisfied with the decision of 
the commissioners concerned he can appeal to the high court by way 
Case Stated, but any original jurisdiction of the high court by declaration or 
otherwise, is, in my judgment, excluded." 

The contentions of the petitioners, that substituting Section 260A of the Income 

Tax Act and divesting the High Court of the appellate remedy and vesting it in the 

NTT, is unconstitutional as it constitutes an inroad into the principles of the rule of 

law and independence of judiciary, according to learned counsel, are fallacious. 

41. According to the learned counsel for the respondents, the fallacy in the 

petitioners' argument is, that they are overlooking the fact that as far as the NTT 

Act is concerned, there is no common law remedy which has now been divested. 

Section 260A of the Income Tax Act and Section 35(g), (h), (i) of the Excise Act 

were all statutorily vested appeals, in the High Court, and as such, as has been 

held in the above mentioned cases can be completely divested. According to 

learned counsel, the NTT Act, was on a surer and sounder footing, than the 

provisions of the Companies Act, which came up for consideration in Union of 

84 


Page 85 

India v. Madras Bar Association, (2010) 11 SCC 87. Accordingly, as no common 

law remedy has been substituted under the present Act, it was submitted, that 

the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioners had no legs to stand. Even 

when the Companies Act set up, the Company Law Tribunal and the Company 

Law Appellate Tribunal, substituting the jurisdiction of the High Courts, this Court 

in Union of India v. Madras Bar Association (supra), held that the said provisions 

were valid and were not unconstitutional. This Court held as under: 

"87. The Constitution contemplates judicial power being exercised by both 
courts and tribunals. Except the powers and jurisdictions vested in superior 
courts by the Constitution, powers and jurisdiction of courts are controlled 
and regulated by Legislative enactments. The High Courts are vested with 
the jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals, revisions and references in 
pursuance of provisions contained in several specific legislative 
enactments. If jurisdiction of the High Courts can be created by providing 
for appeals, revisions and references to be heard by the High Courts, 
jurisdiction can also be taken away by deleting the provisions for appeals, 
revisions or references. It also follows that the legislature has the power to 
create tribunals with reference to specific enactments and confer 
jurisdiction on them to decide disputes in regard to matters arising from 
such special enactments. Therefore it cannot be said that legislature has 
no power to transfer judicial functions traditionally performed by courts to 
tribunals." 
88. The argument that there cannot be "whole-sale transfer of powers" is 
misconceived. It is nobody's case that the entire functioning of courts in the 
country is transferred to tribunals. The competence of the Parliament to 
make a law creating tribunals to deal with disputes arising under or relating 
to a particular statute or statutes cannot be disputed. When a Tribunal is 
constituted under the Companies Act, empowered to deal with disputes 
arising under the said Act and the statute substitutes the word "tribunal" in 
place of "the High Court" necessarily there will be "whole-sale transfer" of 
company law matters to the tribunals. It is an inevitable consequence of 
creation of a tribunal, for such disputes, and will no way affect the validity 
of the law creating the tribunal." 

42. Similarly, statutory provisions providing for a revision to the District Judge, 

with the finality clauses, have been interpreted to exclude the revisionary powers 

85 


Page 86 

of the High Court under Section 115 of CPC. In this behalf reference was made 

to, Aundal Ammal v. Sadasivan Pilai, (1987) 1 SCC 183, wherein it was held as 

under: 

"15. Under the scheme of the Act it appears that a landlord who wants 
eviction of his tenant has to move for eviction and the case has to be 
disposed of by the Rent Control Court. That is provided by Sub-section(2) 
of Section 11 of the Act. From the Rent Control Court, an appeal lies to the 
Appellate Authority under the conditions laid down under Sub-section (l)(b) 
of Section 18 of the Act. From the Appellate Authority a revision in certain 
circumstances lies in case where the appellate authority is a Subordinate 
Judge to the District Court and in other cases to the High Court. In this 
case as mentioned hereinbefore the appeal lay from Rent Control Court to 
the appellate authority who was the Subordinate Judge and therefore the 
revision lay to the District Judge. Indeed it is indisputed that the 
respondent has in this case taken resort to all these provisions. After the 
dismissal of the revision by the District Judge from the appellate decision 
of the Subordinate Judge who confirmed the order of the Rent Controller, 
the respondent-landlord chose again to go before the High Court under 
Section 115 of the CPC. The question, is, can he have a second revision 
to the High Court? Shri Poti submitted that he cannot. We are of the 
opinion that he is right. This position is clear if Sub-section (5) of 
Section 18 of the Act is read in conjunction with Section 20 of the Act. Sub-
section (5) of Section 18, as we have noted hereinbefore, clearly stipulates 
that the decision of the appellate authority and subject to such decision, an 
order of the Rent Controller 'shall be final' and 'shall not be liable to be 
called in question in any court of law', except as provided in Section 20. By 
Section 20, a revision is provided where the appellate authority is 
Subordinate Judge to the District Judge and in other cases, that is to say, 
where the appellate authority is District Judge, to the High Court. The 
ambits of revisional powers are well-settled and need not be re-stated. It is 
inconceivable to have two revisions. The scheme of the Act does not 
warrant such a conclusion. In our opinion, the expression 'shall be final' in 
the Act means what it says. 
20. The learned judge referred to the decision of the Judicial Committee in 
the case of Maung Ba Thaw and Anr.-Insolvents v. Ma Pin, AIR 1934 PC 
81. The learned judge also referred to a decision of this Court in South 
Asia Industries (P) Ltd. v. S.B. Sarup Singh and Ors. (supra). The learned 
judge concluded that so long as there was no specific provision in the 
statute making the determination by the District Court final and excluding 
the supervisory power of the High Court under Section 115 of the CPC, it 
had to be held that the decision rendered by the District Court under 
Section 20(1) of the Act being a decision of a court subordinate to the High 

86 


Page 87 

Court to which an appeal lay to the High Court was liable to be revised by 
the High Court under Section 115 of the CPC. In that view of the matter, 
the Full Bench rejected the view of the division bench of the Kerala High 
Court in Kurien v. Chacko [1960] KLT 1248. With respect, we are unable to 
sustain the view of the Full Bench of the High Court on this aspect of the 
matter. In our opinion, the Full Bench misconstrued the provisions of 
subsection (5) of Section 18 of the Act. Sub-section (5) of 
Section18 clearly states that such decision of the appellate authority as 
mentioned in Section 18 of the Act shall not be liable to be questioned 
except in the manner under Section 20 of the Act. There was thereby an 
implied prohibition or exclusion of a second revision under Section 115 of 
the CPC to the High Court when a revision has been provided under 
Section 20 of the Act in question. When Section 18(5) of the Act 
specifically states that "shall not be liable to be called in question in any 
Court of law" except in the manner provided under Section 20, it cannot be 
said that the High Court which is a court of law and which is a civil court 
under the CPC under Section 115 of the CPC could revise again an order 
once again after revision under Section20 of the Act. That would mean 
there would be a trial by four courts, that would be repugnant to the 
scheme manifest in the different sections of the Act in question. Public 
policy or public interest demands curtailment of law's delay and justice 
demands finality within quick disposal of case. The language of the 
provisions of Section 18(5) read with Section 20 inhibits further revision. 
The courts must so construe." 

Likewise, our attention was invited to Jetha Bai and Sons v. Sunderdas Rathenai 

(1988) 1 SCC 722, and reliance was placed on the following: 

"15. Even without any discussion it may be seen from the narrative given 
above that there is really no conflict between the two decisions because 
the provisions in the two Acts are materially different. However, to clarify 
matters further we may point put the differences between the two Acts in 
greater detail and clarity. Under the Kerala Act, against an order passed by 
a Rent Control Court presided over by a District Munsif, the aggrieved 
party is conferred a right of appeal under Section 18. The Appellate 
Authority has to be a judicial officer not below the rank of a subordinate 
Judge. The appellate Authority has been conferred powers co-extensive 
with those of the Rent Control Court but having over-riding effect. Having 
these factors in mind, the Legislature has declared that in so far as an 
order of a Rent Control Court is concerned it shall be final subject only to 
any modification or revision by an Appellate Authority; and in so far as the 
Appellate Authority is concerned, its decision shall be final and shall not be 
liable to be called in question in any Court of law except as provided in 
Section 20. As regards Section 20, a division of the powers of revision 

87 


Page 88 

exercisable thereunder has been made between the High Court and the 
District Court. In all those cases where a revision is preferred against a 
decision of an Appellate Authority of the rank of a Subordinate Judge 
under Section 18, the District Judge has been constituted the revisional 
authority. It is only in other cases i.e. where the decision sought to be 
revised is that of a judicial officer of a higher rank than a Subordinate 
Judge, the High Court has been constituted the Revisional authority. The 
revisional powers conferred under Section 20, whether it be on the District 
Judge or the High Court as the case may be are of greater amplitude than 
the powers of revision exercisable by a High Court under 
Section 115 Code of Civil Procedure Under Section 20 the Revisional 
Authority is entitled to satisfy itself about the legality regularity, or propriety 
of the orders sought to be revised. Not only that, the Appellate Authority 
and the Revisional Authority have been expressly conferred powers of 
remand under Section 20A of the Act. Therefore, a party is afforded an 
opportunity to put forth his case before the Rent Control Court and then 
before the Appellate Authority and there after if need be before the Court 
of Revision viz. the District Court if the Appellate Authority is of the rank of 
a Subordinate Judge. The Legislature in its wisdom has thought that on 
account of the ample opportunity given to a party to put forth his case 
before three courts, viz. the Trial Court, the Appellate Court and the 
Revisional Court, there was no need to make the revisional order of the 
District Court subject to further scrutiny by the High Court by means of a 
second revision either under the Act or under the Code of Civil Procedure. 
It has been pointed out in Aundal Ammal's case (supra) that the full Bench 
of the Kerala High Court had failed to construe the terms of 
Section 20 read with Section 18(5) in their proper perspective and this 
failing had effected its conclusion According to the Full Bench, a revisional 
order of a District, Court under Section 20 laid itself open for further 
challenge to the High Court under Section115 Code of Civil Procedure 
because of two factors viz. (1) there was no mention in the Act that the 
order would be final and (2) there was no provision in the Act for an appeal 
being filed against a revisional order under Section 20. The full Bench 
failed to notice certain crucial factors. In the first place, Section 20 is a 
composite section and refers to the powers of revision exercisable under 
that Section by a District Judge as well as by the High Court. Such being 
the case if it is to be taken that an order passed by a District Court under 
Section 20 will not have finality because the Section does not specifically 
say so, then it will follow that a revisional order passed by the High Court 
under Section 20 (1) also will not have finality Surely it cannot be 
contended by anyone that an order passed by a High Court in exercise of 
its powers of revision under Section 20 (1) can be subjected to further 
revision because Section 20(1) has not expressly conferred finality to an 
order passed under that Section. Secondly, the terms of Section 20 
(1) have to be read in conjunction with Section 18(5). Section 18(5) as 

88 


Page 89 

already seen, declares that an order of a Rent Control Court shall be final 
subject to the decision of the Appellate Authority and an order of an 
Appellate Authority shall be final and shall not be liable to be called in 
question in any court of law except as provided for in Section 20. When the 
Legislature has declared that even an order of the Rent Control Court and 
the decision of the Appellate Authority shall be final at their respective 
stages unless the order is modified by the Appellate Authority or the 
Revisional Authority as the case may be, there is no necessity for the 
legislature to declare once ever again that an order passed in revision 
under Section 20(1) by the District Judge or the High Court as the case 
may be will also have the seal of finality. The third aspect is that the 
Legislature has not merely conferred finality to the decision of an Appellate 
Authority but has further laid down that the decision shall not be liable to 
be called in question in any court of law except as provided for in 
Section 20. These additional words clearly spell out the prohibition or 
exclusion of a second revision under Section 115 Code of Civil Procedure 
to the High Court against a revisional order passed by a District Court 
under Section 20 of the Act. This position has been succinctly set out in 
para 20 of the judgment in Aundal Ammal's case (supra). As was noticed 
in Vishesh Kumar's case, the intent behind the bifurcation of the jurisdiction 
is to reduce the number of revision petitions filed in the High Court and for 
determining the legislative intent, the Court must as far as possible 
construe a statute in such a manner as would advance the object of the 
legislation and suppress the mischief sought to be cured by it." 

43. Most importantly, a nine-Judge constitution bench judgment of this Court, 

in Mafatlal Industries v. Union of India (1997) 5 SCC 536, while dealing with the 

validity of Section 11B(3) of the Excise Act, held as follows: 

"77. Hereinbefore, we have referred to the provisions relating to refund 
obtaining from time to time under the Central Excise and Salt Act. Whether 
it is Rule 11 (as it stood from time to time) or Section 11-B (as it obtained 
before 1991 or subsequent thereto), they invariably purported to be 
exhaustive on the question of refund. Rule 11, as in force prior to August 
6, 1977, stated that "no duties and charges which have been paid or have 
been adjusted...shall be refunded unless the claimant makes an 
application for such refund under his signature and lodges it to the proper 
officers within three months from the date of such payment or adjustment, 
as the case may be". Rule 11, as in force between 6.8.1977 and 
17.11.1980 contained Sub-rule (4) which expressly declared : "(4) Save as 
otherwise provided by or under this rule, no claim of refund of any duty 
shall be entertained". Section 11-B, as in force prior to April, 1991 
contained Sub-section (4) in identical words. It said : "(4) Save as 
otherwise provided by or under this Act, no claim for refund of any duty of 

89 


Page 90 

excise shall be entertained". Sub-section (5) was more specific and 
emphatic. It said: 
"Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, the provisions 
of this Section shall also apply to a claim for refund of any amount 
collected as duty of excise made on the ground that the goods in 
respect of which such amount was collected were not excisable or 
were entitled to exemption from duty and no court shall have any 
jurisdiction in respect of such claim." 
It started with a non-obstante clause; it took in every kind of refund and 
every claim for refund and it expressly barred the jurisdiction of courts in 
respect of such claim. Sub-section (3) of Section 11-B, as it now stands, 
it's to the same effect -indeed, more comprehensive and all-
encompassing. It says: 
"(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any 
judgment, decree, order or direction of the Appellate Tribunal or any 
court or in any other provision of this Act or the rules made 
thereunder or in any law for the time being in force, no refund shall 
be made except as provided in sub-section". 
The language could not have been more specific and emphatic. The 
exclusivity of the provision relating to refund is not only express and 
unambiguous but is in addition to the general bar arising from the fact that 
the Act creates new rights and liabilities and also provides forums and 
procedures for ascertaining and adjudicating those rights and liabilities and 
all other incidental and ancillary matters, as will be pointed out presently. 
This is a bar upon a bar -an aspect emphasised in Para 23 (supra), and 
has to be respected so long as it stands. The validity of these provisions 
has never been seriously doubted. Even though in certain writ petitions 
now before us, validity of the 1991 (Amendment) Act including the 
amended Section 11-B is questioned, no specific reasons have been 
assigned why a provision of the nature of Sub-section (3) of Section11-
B (amended) is unconstitutional. Applying the propositions enunciated by a 
seven-Judge Bench of this Court in Kamala Mills case, AIR 1965 SC 1942, 
it must be held that Section 11-B (both before and after amendment) is 
valid and constitutional. In Kamala Mills, this Court upheld the 
constitutional validity of Section 20 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act (set out 
hereinbefore) on the ground that the Bombay Act contained adequate 
provisions for refund, for appeal, revision, rectification of mistake and for 
condonation of delay in filing appeal/revision. The Court pointed out that 
had the Bombay Act not provided these remedies and yet barred the resort 
to civil court, the constitutionality of Section 20 may have been in serious 
doubt, but since it does provide such remedies, its validity was beyond 
challenge, to repeat -and it is necessary to do so -so long as Section 11-
B is constitutionally valid, it has to be followed and given effect to. We can 
see no reason on which the constitutionality of the said provision -or a 
similar provision -can be doubted. It must also be remembered that 

90 


Page 91 

Central Excises and Salt Act is a special enactment creating new and 
special obligations and rights, which at the same time prescribes the 
procedure for levy, assessment, collection, refund and all other incidental 
and ancillary provisions. As pointed out in the Statement of Objects and 
Reasons appended to the Bill which became the Act, the Act along with 
the Rules was intended to "form a complete central excise code". The idea 
was "to consolidate in a single enactment all the laws relating to central 
duties of excise". The Act is a self-contained enactment. It contains 
provisions for collecting the taxes which are due according to law but have 
not been collected and also for refunding the taxes which have been 
collected contrary to law, viz., Sections 11-A and 11-B and its allied 
provisions. Both provisions contain a uniform rule of limitation, viz., six 
months, with an exception in each case. Sections 11-A and 11-B are 
complimentary to each other. To such a situation, Proposition No. 3 
enunciated in Kamala Mills becomes applicable, viz., where a statute 
creates a special right or a liability and also provides the procedure for the 
determination of the right or liability by the Tribunals constituted in that 
behalf and provides further that all questions about the said right and 
liability shall be determined by the Tribunals so constituted, the resort to 
civil court is not available -except to the limited extent pointed out in 
Kamala Mills. Central Excise Act specifically provides for refund. It 
expressly declares that no refund shall be made except in accordance 
therewith. The jurisdiction of a civil Court is expressly barred -vide Sub-
section (5) of Section 11-B, prior to its amendment in 1991, and Sub-
section (3) of Section 11-B, as amended in 1991. It is relevant to notice 
that the Act provides for more than one appeal against the orders made 
under Section 11-B /Rule 11. Since 1981, an appeal is provided to this 
Court also from the orders of the Tribunal. While Tribunal is not a 
departmental organ, this Court is a civil court. In this view of the matter and 
the express and additional bar and exclusivity contained in Rule 
11/Section 11-B , at all points of time, it must be held that any and every 
ground including the violation of the principles of natural justice and 
infraction of fundamental principles of judicial procedure can be urged in 
these appeals, obviating the necessity of a suit or a writ petition in matters 
relating to refund. Once the constitutionality of the provisions of the Act 
including the provisions relating to refund is beyond question, they 
constitute "law" within the meaning of Article 265 of the Constitution . It 
follows that any action taken under and in accordance with the said 
provisions would be an action taken under the "authority of law", within the 
meaning of Article 265. In the face of the express provision which 
expressly declares that no claim for refund of any duty shall be entertained 
except in accordance with the said provisions, it is not permissible to resort 
to Section 72 of the Contract Act to do precisely that which is expressly 
prohibited by the said provisions. In other words, it is not permissible to 
claim refund by invoking Section 72 as a separate and independent 

91 


Page 92 

remedy when such a course is expressly barred by the provisions in the 
Act, viz., Rule 11 and Section 11-B . For this reason, a suit for refund would 
also not lie. Taking any other view would amount to nullifying the 
provisions in Rule 11/Section 11-B, which, it needs no emphasis, cannot 
be done. It, therefore, follows that any and every claim for refund of excise 
duty can be made only under and in accordance with Rule 11 or 
Section 11-B, as the case may be, in the forums provided by the Act. No 
suit can be filed for refund of duty invoking Section 72 of the Contract Act. 
So far as the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 -or for that 
matter, the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 -is concerned, it is 
obvious that the provisions of the Act cannot bar and curtail these 
remedies. It is, however, equally obvious that while exercising the power 
under Article 226 /Article 32 , the Court would certainly take note of the 
legislative intent manifested in the provisions of the Act and would exercise 
their jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of the enactment." 

It was submitted, that a perusal of the above paragraph shows, that this Court 

noticed, that against the order of the tribunal an appeal was provided for to this 

Court. The Court declared, that the tribunal was not a departmental organ and 

the Supreme Court was a civil court as it was hearing a statutory appeal. More 

importantly it held, that every ground including violation and infraction of judicial 

procedure could be urged in these appeals, obviating the necessity of a suit or a 

writ petition in matters relating to refund. This Court took care to hold, that so far 

as the jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 226 or this Court under Article 32 

are concerned, they cannot be curtailed. It further held, that it was equally 

obvious that while exercising the power under Article 226/32 the Court would 

certainly take note of the legislative intent manifested in the provisions of the Act 

and would exercise their jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of the 

enactment. It was accordingly submitted, that in view of the conclusions drawn, 

in the above judgment, all the contentions urged by the petitioners, needed to be 

rejected. 

92 


Page 93 

The third contention: 

44. 
Learned counsel for the respondents, vehemently controverted the 

submissions advanced at the hands of the petitioners, that the NTT Act was ultra 

vires the provisions of the Constitution. Insofar as the instant aspect of the 

matter is concerned, learned counsel for the respondents, first placed reliance on 

Article 246 of the Constitution. Article 246 is being extracted hereunder: 

"246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures 
of States -(1) 
Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), 
Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the 
matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution 
referred to as the "Union List"). 
(2) 
Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament and, subject to 
clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with 
respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh 
Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the "Concurrent List"). 
(3) 
Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has 
exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with 
respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule 
(in this Constitution referred to as the 'State List'). 
(4) 
Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for 
any part of the territory of India not included (in a State) notwithstanding 
that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List." 

Based on the aforesaid provision, it was sought to be asserted that the 

Parliament had the unqualified and absolute jurisdiction, power and authority to 

enact laws in respect of matters enumerated in Lists I and III of the Constitution. 

Additionally, placing reliance on Article 246(4), it was asserted, that even on 

subjects not expressly provided for in the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule to 

the Constitution, the Parliament still had the absolute and untrammeled right to 

enact legislation. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, 

93 


Page 94 

learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on entries 77 to 79, 82 to 84, 

95 and 97 of List I. The above entries are being extracted hereunder: 

List I -Union List 
"77. Constitution, organisation, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme 
Court (including contempt of such Court), and the fees taken therein; 
persons entitled to practise before the Supreme Court. 
78. Constitution and organisation (including vacations) of the High 
Courts except provisions as to officers and servants of High Courts; 
persons entitled to practise before the High Courts. 
79. Extension of the jurisdiction of a High Court to, and exclusion of the 
jurisdiction of a High Court from, any Union territory. 
82. Taxes on income other than agricultural income. 
83. Duties of customs including export duties. 
84. Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or 
produced in India except -
(a) 
alcoholic liquors for human consumption. 
(b) 
opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, 
but including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any 
substance included in sub-paragraph (b) of this entry. 
95. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with 
respect to any of the matters in this List; admiralty jurisdiction. 
97. Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax 
not mentioned in either of those Lists." 

Based on the entries reproduced hereinabove, especially entries 77 to 79, it was 

submitted, that Parliament had the jurisdiction to enact legislation even in respect 

of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Additionally, it had the power to 

legislate, and thereby, to extend or exclude the jurisdiction of a High Court. 

Relying on entries 82 to 84, it was the submission of the learned counsel for the 

respondents, that on matters of income-tax, customs duty and excise duty, the 

power to legislate was unequivocally vested with the Parliament. Reliance was 

placed on entry 95, to contend, that the extent of the jurisdiction of all courts 

including the High Court, in respect of matters expressed in List I could also be 

laid down by the Parliament. Referring again to entries 82 to 84 it was submitted, 

94 


Page 95 

that the extension or exclusion of jurisdiction on tax matters, was also within the 

domain of Parliament. So as to assert, that in case this Court was of the view, 

that the subject of the legislation contained in the NTT Act did not find mention, in 

any of the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the 

submission on behalf of the respondents was, that Parliament would still have 

the authority to legislate thereon, under entry 97 contained in List I of the 

Seventh Schedule. 

45. 
Learned counsel for the respondents, also placed reliance on entries 

11A and 46 contained in List III of Seventh Schedule. The above entries are 

being extracted hereunder: 

List III -Concurrent List 
"11A. Administration of justice; constitution and organisation of all courts, 
except the Supreme Court and the High Courts. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
46. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with 
respect to any of the matters in this List." 

Referring to the above entries, it was the contention of the learned counsel for 

the respondents that Parliament had the authority to enact legislation, in respect 

of the extent of jurisdiction and powers of courts, including the High Court. It 

was, however pointed out, that this power extended only to such matters and 

subjects, that found mention in List III of the Seventh Schedule. It was, therefore, 

that reliance was placed on entry 11A in List III, to contend that administration of 

justice, constitution and organization of all courts (except the Supreme Court and 

the High Courts) would lead to the inevitable conclusion that the NTT Act was 

promulgated, well within the power vested with the Parliament, under Article 

246(2) of the Constitution. 

95 


Page 96 

46. Additionally, reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the 

respondents, on Article 247 of the Constitution, which is reproduced hereunder: 

"247. Power of Parliament to provide for the establishment of certain 
additional courts. -Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, Parliament 
may by law provide for the establishment of any additional courts for the 
better administration of laws made by Parliament or of any existing laws 
with respect to a matter enumerated in the Union List." 

Referring to the above provision, it was the assertion of the learned counsel for 

the respondents, that power was expressly vested with the Parliament, to 

establish additional courts, for better administration of laws. It was submitted, 

that this was exactly what the Parliament had chosen to do, while enacting the 

NTT Act. Referring to the objects and reasons, indicating the basis of the 

enactment of the NTT Act, it was the categoric assertion at the hands of the 

learned counsel, that the impugned enactment was promulgated with the clear 

understanding, that the NTT would provide better adjudication of legal issues, 

arising out of direct/indirect tax laws. 

47. Besides Articles 246 and 247 of the Constitution, learned counsel for the 

respondents asserted, that Articles 323A and 323B were inserted into the 

Constitution, by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The 

above provisions were included in the newly enacted Part XIV A of the 

Constitution. It was asserted, that the instant amendment of the Constitution was 

made for achieving two objectives. Firstly, to exclude the power of judicial review 

of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, totally. Thus excluding judicial review 

in its entirety. And secondly, to create independent specialized tribunals, with 

power of judicial review, which would ease the burden of the High Courts and the 

96 


Page 97 

Supreme Court. It was however acknowledged by learned counsel representing 

the respondents, that the first of the above mentioned objectives, was interpreted 

by this Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261, which 

struck down clause (2)(d) of Article 323A and clause (3)(d) of Article 323B, to the 

extent the amended provisions introduced by the Forty-second Amendment to 

the Constitution, excluded the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme 

Court under Articles 226/227 and 32/136 respectively. Insofar as the second 

objective is concerned, placing reliance in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), it was 

the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that this Court had 

clearly concluded, that as long as the power of judicial review continue with the 

High Courts and the Supreme Court, under the provisions referred to 

hereinabove, the enactment under reference would be constitutionally valid. 

Therefore, in response to the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned 

counsel for the petitioners (as have been noticed hereinabove), it was the 

contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the power to enact 

the NTT Act, was clearly vested with the Parliament even under Article 323B of 

the Constitution. Furthermore, since the impugned enactment did not exclude 

the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, 

and also, did not exclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Articles 32 

and 136 of the Constitution, the challenge to the constitutional validity of the NTT 

Act was wholly unjustified. 

48. Learned counsel for the respondents was at pains to emphasise, that the 

jurisdictional road of Courts, as final interpreter of the law, was clearly preserved. 

97 


Page 98 

Firstly, because a statutory appeal was provided for under the NTT Act to the 

Supreme Court. And secondly because, judicial review vested in the High Courts 

under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, and in the Supreme Court under 

Articles 32 and 136 of the Constitution, had been kept intact. It is, therefore, the 

submission of the learned counsel for the respondents, that no fault can be found 

in the vesting of appellate jurisdiction from orders passed by Appellate Tribunals 

(constituted under the Income Tax Act, Customs Act and the Excise Act) with the 

NTT. 

49. While acknowledging the fact, that the jurisdiction vested in the High 

Courts to hear appeals from the Appellate Tribunals, under the Income Tax Act 

(vide Section 260A), the Customs Act (vide Section 130), and the Excise Act 

(vide Section 35G), has been transferred from the jurisdictional High Court to the 

NTT, it was submitted that appellate jurisdiction vested in a High Court under a 

statute, could be taken away by an amendment of the statute. Stated simply, the 

submission at the behest of the respondents was, whatever is vested by a 

statutory enactment, can likewise be divested in the same manner. It was 

therefore sought to be asserted, that the grounds of challenge to the NTT Act 

raised, at the behest of the petitioners, were misconceived and unacceptable. 

50. Besides the submissions noticed hereinabove, it was also contended on 

behalf of the respondents, that the assertion made by the petitioners, that 

appellate jurisdiction on "substantial questions of law" could not be vested with 

the NTT, was fallacious. In this behalf, it was sought to be reiterated, that 

jurisdiction of civil courts (including the original side of the High Court) was 

98 


Page 99 

barred in respect of tax related issues. It was sought to be explained, that a case 

could involve questions of fact, as well as, questions of law right from the stage 

of the initial adjudicatory authority. But, it was pointed out, that only cases 

involving "substantial questions of law" would qualify for adjudication at the hands 

of the NTT. As such, placing reliance on the decision in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. 

v. Union of India (1997) 5 SCC 536, it was submitted, that the above contention 

raised by the petitioners had no legs to stand. Furthermore, it was sought to be 

pointed out, that the phrase "substantial questions of law" has been interpreted 

by this Court to mean, not only questions of general pubic importance, but also 

questions which would directly and substantially affect the rights of the parties to 

the litigation. It was also asserted, that a question of law would also include, a 

legal issue not previously settled, subject to the condition, that it had a material 

bearing on the determination of the controversy to be settled, between the 

parties. It is accordingly contended, that no limited interpretation could be placed 

on the term "substantial questions of law". Accordingly, it was submitted, that a 

challenge to the constitution of the NTT on the premise that the NTT was vested 

with the jurisdiction to settle "substantial questions of law" was unsustainable. 

51. 
In order to support his above submission, learned counsel for the 

respondents placed emphatic reliance on a few judgments rendered by this 

Court. The same are being noticed hereunder: 

(i) 
Reliance was also placed on L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 

SCC 261. Learned counsel for the respondents, while relying on the instant 

judgment, made a reference to various observations recorded therein. We wish 

99 


Page 100 

to incorporate hereunder all the paragraphs on which reliance was placed by the 

learned counsel:-

"80. However, it is important to emphasise that though the subordinate 
judiciary or Tribunals created under ordinary legislations cannot exercise 
the power of judicial review of legislative action to the exclusion of the High 
Courts and the Supreme Court, there is no constitutional prohibition 
against their performing a supplemental -as opposed to a substitutional 
-role in this respect. That such a situation is contemplated within the 
constitutional scheme becomes evident when one analyses clause (3) of 
Article 32 of the Constitution which reads as under: 
"32. Remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part.-
(1) 
… 
… 
… 
… 
… 
(2) 
… 
… 
… 
… 
… 
(3) 
Without prejudice to the powers conferred on the Supreme 
Court by clauses (1) and (2), Parliament may by law empower any 
other court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or 
any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court under clause 
(2). " 
81. If the power under Article 32 of the Constitution, which has been 
described as the "heart" and "soul" of the Constitution, can be additionally 
conferred upon "any other court", there is no reason why the same 
situation cannot subsist in respect of the jurisdiction conferred upon the 
High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution. So long as the 
jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226/227 and that of this Court 
under Article 32 is retained, there is no reason why the power to test the 
validity of legislations against the provisions of the Constitution cannot be 
conferred upon Administrative Tribunals created under the Act or upon 
Tribunals created under Article 323-B of the Constitution. It is to be 
remembered that, apart from the authorisation that flows from Articles 323-
A and 323-B, both Parliament and the State Legislatures possess 
legislative competence to effect changes in the original jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court and the High Courts. This power is available to Parliament 
under Entries 77, 78, 79 and 95 of List I and to the State Legislatures 
under Entry 65 of List II; Entry 46 of List III can also be availed of both by 
Parliament and the State Legislatures for this purpose. 
82. There are pressing reasons why we are anxious to preserve the 
conferment of such a power on these Tribunals. When the Framers of our 
Constitution bestowed the powers of judicial review of legislative action 
upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court, they ensured that other 
constitutional safeguards were created to assist them in effectively 
discharging this onerous burden. The expectation was that this power 
would be required to be used only occasionally. However, in the five 
decades that have ensued since Independence, the quantity of litigation 

100 


Page 101 

before the High Courts has exploded in an unprecedented manner. The 
decision in Sampath Kumar's case, AIR 1987 SC 386, was rendered 
against such a backdrop. We are conscious of the fact that when a 
Constitution Bench of this Court in Sampath Kumar's case (supra) adopted 
the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms, it was attempting to 
remedy an alarming practical situation and the approach selected by it 
appeared to be most appropriate to meet the exigencies of the time. Nearly 
a decade later, we are now in a position to review the theoretical and 
practical results that have arisen as a consequence of the adoption of such 
an approach. 
83. We must, at this stage, focus upon the factual position which 
occasioned the adoption of the theory of alternative institutional 
mechanisms in Sampath Kumar's case (supra). In his leading judgment, R. 
Misra, J. refers to the fact that since Independence, the population 
explosion and the increase in litigation had greatly increased the burden of 
pendency in the High Courts. Reference was made to studies conducted 
towards relieving the High Courts of their increased load. In this regard, the 
recommendations of the Shah Committee for setting up independent 
Tribunals as also the suggestion of the Administrative Reforms 
Commission that Civil Service Tribunals be set up, were noted. Reference 
was also made to the decision in K.K. Dutta v. Union of India, (1980) 4 
SCC 38, where this Court had, while emphasising the need for speedy 
resolution of service disputes, proposed the establishment of Service 
Tribunals. 
84. The problem of clearing the backlogs of High Courts, which has 
reached colossal proportions in our times is, nevertheless, one that has 
been the focus of study for close to a half century. Over time, several 
Expert Committees and Commissions have analysed the intricacies 
involved and have made suggestions, not all of which have been 
consistent. Of the several studies that have been conducted in this regard, 
as many as twelve have been undertaken by the Law Commission of India 
(hereinafter referred to as "the LCI") or similar high-level committees 
appointed by the Central Government, and are particularly noteworthy.

Reform of Judicial Administration (1958); LCI, 27 th Report on Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (1964); LCI, 41 st Report on Code of Criminal Procedure,

85. An appraisal of the daunting task which confronts the High Courts 
can be made by referring to the assessment undertaken by the LCI in its 
124th Report which was released sometime after the judgment in Sampath 
Kumar's case (supra). The Report was delivered in 1988, nine years ago, 
and some changes have occurred since, but the broad perspective which 
emerges is still, by and large, true: 
"… The High Courts enjoy civil as well as criminal, ordinary as well 
as extraordinary, and general as well as special jurisdiction. The 
source of the jurisdiction is the Constitution and the various statutes 
as well as letters patent and other instruments constituting the High 
Courts. The High Courts in the country enjoy an original jurisdiction 
in respect of testamentary, matrimonial and guardianship matters. 
Original jurisdiction is conferred on the High Courts under the 
Representation of the People Act, 1951, Companies Act, 1956, and 
several other special statutes. The High Courts, being courts of 
record, have the power to punish for its contempt as well as 
contempt of its subordinate courts. The High Courts enjoy 
extraordinary jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution enabling it to issue prerogative writs, such as, the one in 
the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto 
and certiorari. Over and above this, the High Courts of Bombay, 
Calcutta, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and 
Madras also exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction. The High 
Courts also enjoy advisory jurisdiction, as evidenced by Section 256 
of the Indian Companies Act, 1956, Section 27 of the Wealth Tax 
Act, 1957, Section 26 of the Gift Tax Act, 1958, and Section 18 of 
the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964. Similarly, there are 
parallel provisions conferring advisory jurisdiction on the High 
Courts, such as, Section 130 of the Customs Act, 1962, and Section 
354 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. The High Courts have 
also enjoyed jurisdiction under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, and the 
Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936. Different types of litigation 
coming before the High Court in exercise of its wide jurisdiction bear 
different names. The vast area of jurisdiction can be appreciated by 
reference to those names, viz., (a) first appeals; (b) appeals under 
the letters patent; (c) second appeals; (d) revision petitions; (e) 
criminal appeals; (f) criminal revisions; (g) civil and criminal 
references; (h) writ petitions; (i) writ appeals; (j) references under 
direct and indirect tax laws; (k) matters arising under the Sales Tax 
Act; (l) election petitions under the Representation of the People Act; 
(m) petitions under the Companies Act, Banking Companies Act and 
other special Acts and (n) wherever the High Court has original 
jurisdiction, suits and other proceedings in exercise of that 
jurisdiction. This varied jurisdiction has to some extent been 

102 


Page 103 

responsible for a very heavy institution of matters in the High 
Courts." 
86. After analysing the situation existing in the High Courts at length, the 
LCI made specific recommendations towards the establishment of 
specialist Tribunals thereby lending force to the approach adopted in 
Sampath Kumar's case (supra). The LCI noted the erstwhile international 
judicial trend which pointed towards generalist courts yielding their place to 
specialist Tribunals. Describing the pendency in the High Courts as 
"catastrophic, crisis-ridden, almost unmanageable, imposing … an 
immeasurable burden on the system", the LCI stated that the prevailing 
view in Indian Jurisprudence that the jurisdiction enjoyed by the High Court 
is a holy cow required a review. It, therefore, recommended the trimming of 
the jurisdiction of the High Courts by setting up specialist courts/Tribunals 
while simultaneously eliminating the jurisdiction of the High Courts. 
87. It is important to realise that though the theory of alternative 
institutional mechanisms was propounded in Sampath Kumar's case 
(supra) in respect of the Administrative Tribunals, the concept itself -that 
of creating alternative modes of dispute resolution which would relieve 
High Courts of their burden while simultaneously providing specialised 
justice -is not new. In fact, the issue of having a specialised tax court has 
been discussed for several decades; though the Report of the High Court 
Arrears Committee (1972) dismissed it as "ill-conceived", the LCI, in its 
115th Report (1986) revived the recommendation of setting up separate 
Central Tax Courts. Similarly, other Reports of the LCI have suggested the 
setting up of 'Gram Nyayalayas' [LCI, 114th Report (1986)], 
Industrial/Labour Tribunals [LCI, 122nd Report (1987)] and Education 
Tribunals [LCI, 123rd Report (1987)]. 
88. In R.K. Jain's case, (1993) AIR SCW 1899, this Court had, in order 
to understand how the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms had 
functioned in practice, recommended that the LCI or a similar expert body 
should conduct a survey of the functioning of these Tribunals. It was hoped 
that such a study, conducted after gauging the working of the Tribunals 
over a sizeable period of more than five years would provide an answer to 
the questions posed by the critics of the theory. Unfortunately, we do not 
have the benefit of such a study. We may, however, advert to the Report of 
the Arrears Committee (1989-90), popularly known as the Malimath 
Committee Report, which has elaborately dealt with the aspect. The 
observations contained in the Report, to this extent they contain a review 
of the functioning of the Tribunals over a period of three years or so after 
their institution, will be useful for our purpose. Chapter VIII of the second 
volume of the Report, "Alternative Modes and Forums for Dispute 
Resolution", deals with the issue at length. After forwarding its specific 
recommendations on the feasibility of setting up 'Gram Nyayalayas', 
Industrial Tribunals and Educational Tribunals, the Committee has dealt 
with the issue of Tribunals set up under Articles 323-A and 323-B of the 

103 


Page 104 

Constitution. The relevant observations in this regard, being of 
considerable significance to our analysis, are extracted in full as under: 
"Functioning of Tribunals 
8.63 Several tribunals are functioning in the country. Not all of 
them, however, have inspired confidence in the public mind . The 
reasons are not far to seek. The foremost is the lack of competence, 
objectivity and judicial approach. The next is their constitution, the 
power and method of appointment of personnel thereto, the inferior 
status and the casual method of working. The last is their actual 
composition; men of calibre are not willing to be appointed as 
presiding officers in view of the uncertainty of tenure, unsatisfactory 
conditions of service, executive subordination in matters of 
administration and political interference in judicial functioning. For 
these and other reasons, the quality of justice is stated to have 
suffered and the cause of expedition is not found to have been 
served by the establishment of such tribunals. 
8.64 Even the experiment of setting up of the Administrative 
Tribunals under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, has not been 
widely welcomed. Its members have been selected from all kinds of 
services including the Indian Police Service. The decision of the 
State Administrative Tribunals are not appealable except under 
Article 136 of the Constitution. On account of the heavy cost and 
remoteness of the forum, there is virtual negation of the right of 
appeal. This has led to denial of justice in many cases and 
consequential dissatisfaction. There appears to be a move in some 
of the States where they have been established for their abolition. 
Tribunals -Tests for Including High Court's Jurisdiction 
8.65 A Tribunal which substitutes the High Court as an alternative 
institutional mechanism for judicial review must be no less 
efficacious than the High Court. Such a tribunal must inspire 
confidence and public esteem that it is a highly competent and 
expert mechanism with judicial approach and objectivity. What is 
needed in a tribunal, which is intended to supplant the High Court, is 
legal training and experience, and judicial acumen, equipment and 
approach . When such a tribunal is composed of personnel drawn 
from the judiciary as well as from services or from amongst experts 
in the field, any weightage in favour of the service members or 
expert members and value-discounting the judicial members would 
render the tribunal less effective and efficacious than the High Court. 
The Act setting up such a tribunal would itself have to be declared 
as void under such circumstances. The same would not at all be 
conducive to judicial independence and may even tend, directly or 
indirectly, to influence their decision-making process, especially 
when the Government is a litigant in most of the cases coming 
before such tribunal. (See S.P. Sampath Kumar's case (supra)). 

104 


Page 105 

The protagonists of specialist tribunals, who simultaneously with 
their establishment want exclusion of the writ jurisdiction of the High 
Courts in regard to matters entrusted for adjudication to such 
tribunals, ought not to overlook these vital and important aspects. It 
must not be forgotten that what is permissible to be supplanted by 
another equally effective and efficacious institutional mechanism is 
the High Courts and not the judicial review itself. Tribunals are not 
an end in themselves but a means to an end; even if the laudable 
objectives of speedy justice, uniformity of approach, predictability of 
decisions and specialist justice are to be achieved, the framework of 
the tribunal intended to be set up to attain them must still retain its 
basic judicial character and inspire public confidence. Any scheme 
of decentralisation of administration of justice providing for an 
alternative institutional mechanism in substitution of the High Courts 
must pass the aforesaid test in order to be constitutionally valid. 
8.66 The overall picture regarding the tribunalisation of justice in 
our country is not satisfactory and encouraging. There is a need for 
a fresh look and review and a serious consideration before the 
experiment is extended to new areas of fields, especially if the 
constitutional jurisdiction of the High Courts is to be simultaneously 
ousted . Not many tribunals satisfying the aforesaid tests can 
possibly be established." 
Having expressed itself in this manner, the Malimath Committee 
specifically recommended that the theory of alternative institutional 
mechanisms be abandoned. Instead, it recommended that institutional 
changes be carried out within the High Courts, dividing them into separate 
divisions for different branches of law, as is being done in England. It 
stated that appointing more Judges to man the separate divisions while 
using the existing infrastructure would be a better way of remedying the 
problem of pendency in the High Courts. 
89. In the years that have passed since the Report of the Malimath 
Committee was delivered, the pendency in the High Courts has 
substantially increased and we are of the view that its recommendation is 
not suited to our present context. That the various Tribunals have not 
performed up to expectations is a self-evident and widely acknowledged 
truth. However, to draw an inference that their unsatisfactory performance 
points to their being founded on a fundamentally unsound principle would 
not be correct. The reasons for which the Tribunals were constituted still 
persist; indeed, those reasons have become even more pronounced in our 
times. We have already indicated that our constitutional scheme permits 
the setting up of such Tribunals. However, drastic measures may have to 
be resorted to in order to elevate their standards to ensure that they stand 
up to constitutional scrutiny in the discharge of the power of judicial review 
conferred upon them. 

105 


Page 106 

90. We may first address the issue of exclusion of the power of judicial 
review of the High Courts. We have already held that in respect of the 
power of judicial review, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 
226/227 cannot be excluded. It has been contended before us that the 
Tribunals should not be allowed to adjudicate upon matters where the vires 
of legislations is questioned, and that they should restrict themselves to 
handling matters where constitutional issues are not raised. We cannot 
bring ourselves to agree to this proposition as that may result in splitting up 
proceedings and may cause avoidable delay. If such a view were to be 
adopted, it would be open for litigants to raise constitutional issues, many 
of which may be quite frivolous, to directly approach the High Courts and 
thus subvert the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. Moreover, even in these 
special branches of law, some areas do involve the consideration of 
constitutional questions on a regular basis; for instance, in service law 
matters, a large majority of cases involve an interpretation of Articles 14, 
15 and 16 of the Constitution. To hold that the Tribunals have no power to 
handle matters involving constitutional issues would not serve the purpose 
for which they were constituted. On the other hand, to hold that all such 
decisions will be subject to the jurisdiction of the High Courts under 
Articles 226/227 of the Constitution before a Division Bench of the High 
Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal concerned falls will 
serve two purposes. While saving the power of judicial review of legislative 
action vested in the High Courts under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution, 
it will ensure that frivolous claims are filtered out through the process of 
adjudication in the Tribunal. The High Court will also have the benefit of a 
reasoned decision on merits which will be of use to it in finally deciding the 
matter. 
91. It has also been contended before us that even in dealing with cases 
which are properly before the Tribunals, the manner in which justice is 
dispensed by them leaves much to be desired. Moreover, the remedy 
provided in the parent statutes, by way of an appeal by special leave under 
Article 136 of the Constitution, is too costly and inaccessible for it to be real 
and effective. Furthermore, the result of providing such a remedy is that 
the docket of the Supreme Court is crowded with decisions of Tribunals 
that are challenged on relatively trivial grounds and it is forced to perform 
the role of a first appellate court. We have already emphasised the 
necessity for ensuring that the High Courts are able to exercise judicial 
superintendence over the decisions of the Tribunals under Article 227 of 
the Constitution. In R.K. Jain's case (supra) , after taking note of these 
facts, it was suggested that the possibility of an appeal from the Tribunal 
on questions of law to a Division Bench of a High Court within whose 
territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal falls, be pursued. It appears that no 
follow-up action has been taken pursuant to the suggestion. Such a 
measure would have improved matters considerably. Having regard to 
both the aforestated contentions, we hold that all decisions of Tribunals, 

106 


Page 107 

whether created pursuant to Article 323-A or Article 323-B of the 
Constitution, will be subject to the High Court's writ jurisdiction under 
Articles 226/227 of the Constitution, before a Division Bench of the High 
Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the particular Tribunal falls. 
92. We may add here that under the existing system, direct appeals 
have been provided from the decisions of all Tribunals to the Supreme 
Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. In view of our above-mentioned 
observations, this situation will also stand modified. In the view that we 
have taken, no appeal from the decision of a Tribunal will directly lie before 
the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution; but instead, the 
aggrieved party will be entitled to move the High Court under Articles 
226/227 of the Constitution and from the decision of the Division Bench of 
the High Court the aggrieved party could move this Court under Article 136 
of the Constitution. 
93. Before moving on to other aspects, we may summarise our 
conclusions on the jurisdictional powers of these Tribunals. The Tribunals 
are competent to hear matters where the vires of statutory provisions are 
questioned. However, in discharging this duty, they cannot act as 
substitutes for the High Courts and the Supreme Court which have, under 
our constitutional set-up, been specifically entrusted with such an 
obligation. Their function in this respect is only supplementary and all such 
decisions of the Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a Division 
Bench of the respective High Courts. The Tribunals will consequently also 
have the power to test the vires of subordinate legislations and rules. 
However, this power of the Tribunals will be subject to one important 
exception. The Tribunals shall not entertain any question regarding the 
vires of their parent statutes following the settled principle that a Tribunal 
which is a creature of an Act cannot declare that very Act to be 
unconstitutional. In such cases alone, the High Court concerned may be 
approached directly. All other decisions of these Tribunals, rendered in 
cases that they are specifically empowered to adjudicate upon by virtue of 
their parent statutes, will also be subject to scrutiny before a Division 
Bench of their respective High Courts. We may add that the Tribunals will, 
however, continue to act as the only courts of first instance in respect of 
the areas of law for which they have been constituted. By this, we mean 
that it will not be open for litigants to directly approach the High Courts 
even in cases where they question the vires of statutory legislations 
(except, as mentioned, where the legislation which creates the particular 
Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the concerned 
Tribunal. 
94. The directions issued by us in respect of making the decisions of 
Tribunals amenable to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the respective 
High Courts will, however, come into effect prospectively i.e. will apply to 
decisions rendered hereafter. To maintain the sanctity of judicial 

107 


Page 108 

proceedings, we have invoked the doctrine of prospective overruling so as 
not to disturb the procedure in relation to decisions already rendered." 

Based on the decisions of this Court referred to above, it was the contention of 

the learned counsel for the respondents, that the submissions advanced on 

behalf of the petitioners, are liable to outright rejection. 

(ii) 
Reliance was placed first of all on Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar 

Association, (2002) 4 SCC 275. Insofar as the controversy raised in the instant 

judgment is concerned, it would be relevant to mention, that banks and financial 

institutions had been experiencing considerable difficulties in recovery of loans, 

and enforcement of securities. The procedure for recovery of debts due to banks 

and financial institutions, which was being followed, had resulted in the funds 

being blocked. To remedy the above situation, Parliament enacted the Recovery 

of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. The Act, inter alia, 

provided for establishment of tribunals and Appellate Tribunals. The said 

tribunals were given jurisdiction, powers and authority, to entertain and decide, 

applications from banks and financial institutions, for recovery of debts, due to 

banks and financial institutions. The Appellate Tribunal, was vested with the 

jurisdiction and authority, to entertain appeals. The procedure to be followed by 

the tribunals, as also, the Appellate Tribunals, was provided for under the above 

enactment. The legislation also provided for modes of recovery of debts through 

Recovery Officers (appointed under the Act). The constitutional validity of the 

Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 was raised 

on the ground, that the legislation was unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of 

the Constitution. It was also the claim of those who raised the said challenge, 

108 


Page 109 

that the enactment was beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament. 

The controversy came to be examined, in the first instance, by the Delhi High 

Court (in Delhi High Court Bar Association v. Union of India, AIR 1975 Delhi 

323). The Delhi High Court held, that even though the tribunal could be 

constituted by the Parliament, and even though the constitution of the tribunal 

was within the purview of Articles 323A and 323B of the Constitution, and despite 

the fact that, the expression "administration of justice" appearing in entry 11A of 

List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, would also include tribunals 

administering justice, yet the impugned Act was unconstitutional, as it had the 

effect of eroding the independence of the judiciary, besides being irrational, 

discriminatory, unreasonable and arbitrary. As such it was held, that the 

provisions of the enactment were violative of the mandate contained in Article 14 

of the Constitution. The High Court, in its judgment, also quashed the 

appointment of Presiding Officers of the tribunal. While adjudicating upon the 

above controversy in reference to some of the issues that have been raised 

before us, our pointed attention was invited to the following observations: 

"21. ….. Sub-section (20) of Section 19 provides that after giving the 
applicant and the defendant an opportunity of being heard, the Tribunal 
may pass such interim or final order as it thinks fit to meet the ends of 
justice. It is after this order that a certificate is issued by the Presiding 
Officer to the Recovery Officer for recovery of money. Section 22 of the Act 
has not been amended. Therefore, reading Sections 19 and 22 of the Act 
together, it appears that the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal are to be 
guided by the principles of natural justice while trying the matter before 
them. Section 22(1) of the Act stipulates that the Tribunal and the 
Appellate Tribunal, while being guided by the principles of natural justice, 
are to be subjected to the other provisions of the Act and the Rules. Rule 
12(7) provides that if a defendant denies his liability to pay the claim made 
by the applicant, the Tribunal may act upon the affidavit of the applicant 

109 


Page 110 

who is acquainted with the facts of the case. In this Rule, which deals with 
the consideration of the applicant's bank application, there is no reference 
to the examination of witnesses. This sub-rule refers only to the affidavit of 
the applicant. Rule 12(6), on the other hand, provides that the Tribunal 
may, at any time, for sufficient reason order a fact to be proved by affidavit 
or may pass an order that the affidavit of any witness may be read at the 
hearing. It is in the proviso to this sub-rule that a reference is made to the 
cross-examination of witnesses. 
22. At the outset, we find that Rule 12 is not happily worded. The reason 
for establishing Banking Tribunals being to expedite the disposal of the 
claims by the banks, Parliament thought it proper only to require the 
principles of natural justice to be the guiding factor for the Tribunals in 
deciding the applications, as is evident from Section 22 of the Act. While 
the Tribunal has, no doubt, been given the power of summoning and 
enforcing the attendance of any witness and examining him on oath, but 
the Act does not contain any provision which makes it mandatory for the 
witness to be examined, if such a witness could be produced. Rule 12(6) 
has to be read harmoniously with the other provisions of the Act and the 
Rules. As we have already noticed, Rule 12(7) gives the Tribunal the 
power to act upon the affidavit of the applicant where the defendant denies 
his liability to pay the claims. Rule 12(6), if paraphrased, would read as 
follows: 
1. 
the Tribunal may, at any time for sufficient reason, order that 
any particular fact or facts may be proved by affidavit … on such 
conditions as the Tribunal thinks reasonable; 
2. 
the Tribunal may, at any time for sufficient reason, order … 
that the affidavit of any witness may be read at the hearing, on such 
conditions as the Tribunal thinks reasonable. 
23. In other words, the Tribunal has the power to require any particular 
fact to be proved by affidavit, or it may order that the affidavit of any 
witness may be read at the hearing. While passing such an order, it must 
record sufficient reasons for the same. The proviso to Rule 12(6) would 
certainly apply only where the Tribunal chooses to issue a direction on its 
own, for any particular fact to be proved by affidavit or the affidavit of a 
witness being read at the hearing. The said proviso refers to the desire of 
an applicant or a defendant for the production of a witness for cross-
examination. In the setting in which the said proviso occurs, it would 
appear to us that once the parties have filed affidavits in support of their 
respective cases, it is only thereafter that the desire for a witness to be 
cross-examined can legitimately arise. It is at that time, if it appears to the 
Tribunal, that such a witness can be produced and it is necessary to do so 
and there is no desire to prolong the case that it shall require the witness 
to be present for cross-examination and in the event of his not appearing, 
then the affidavit shall not be taken into evidence. When the High Courts 
and the Supreme Court in exercise of their jurisdiction under Article 226 

110 


Page 111 

and Article 32 can decide questions of fact as well as law merely on the 
basis of documents and affidavits filed before them ordinarily, there should 
be no reason as to why a Tribunal, likewise, should not be able to decide 
the case merely on the basis of documents and affidavits before it. It is 
common knowledge that hardly any transaction with the bank would be 
oral and without proper documentation, whether in the form of letters or 
formal agreements. In such an event the bona fide need for the oral 
examination of a witness should rarely arise. There has to be a very good 
reason to hold that affidavits, in such a case, would not be sufficient. 
24. The manner in which a dispute is to be adjudicated upon is decided 
by the procedural laws which are enacted from time to time. It is because 
of the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure that normally all disputes 
between the parties of a civil nature would be adjudicated upon by the civil 
courts. There is no absolute right in anyone to demand that his dispute is 
to be adjudicated upon only by a civil court. The decision of the Delhi High 
Court proceeds on the assumption that there is such a right. As we have 
already observed, it is by reason of the provisions of the Code of Civil 
Procedure that the civil courts had the right, prior to the enactment of the 
Debts Recovery Act, to decide the suits for recovery filed by the banks and 
financial institutions. This forum, namely, that of a civil court, now stands 
replaced by a Banking Tribunal in respect of the debts due to the bank. 
When in the Constitution Articles 323-A and 323-B contemplate 
establishment of a Tribunal and that does not erode the independence of 
the judiciary, there is no reason to presume that the Banking Tribunals and 
the Appellate Tribunals so constituted would not be independent, or that 
justice would be denied to the defendants or that the independence of the 
judiciary would stand eroded. 
25. Such Tribunals, whether they pertain to income tax or sales tax or 
excise or customs or administration, have now become an essential part of 
the judicial system in this country. Such specialised institutions may not 
strictly come within the concept of the judiciary, as envisaged by Article 50, 
but it cannot be presumed that such Tribunals are not an effective part of 
the justice delivery system, like courts of law. It will be seen that for a 
person to be appointed as a Presiding Officer of a Tribunal, he should be 
one who is qualified to be a District Judge and, in case of appointment of 
the Presiding Officer of the Appellate Tribunal he is, or has been, qualified 
to be a Judge of a High Court or has been a member of the Indian Legal 
Service who has held a post in Grade I for at least three years or has held 
office as the Presiding Officer of a Tribunal for at least three years. 
Persons who are so appointed as Presiding Officers of the Tribunal or of 
the Appellate Tribunal would be well versed in law to be able to decide 
cases independently and judiciously. It has to be borne in mind that the 
decision of the Appellate Tribunal is not final, in the sense that the same 
can be subjected to judicial review by the High Court under Articles 226 
and 227 of the Constitution. 

111 


Page 112 

26. With the establishment of the Tribunals, Section 31 provides for the 
transfer of pending cases from civil courts to the Tribunal. We do not find 
such a provision being in any way bad in law. Once a Debts Recovery 
Tribunal has been established, and the jurisdiction of courts barred by 
Section 18 of the Act, it would be only logical that any matter pending in 
the civil court should stand transferred to the Tribunal. This is what 
happened when the Central Administrative Tribunal was established. All 
cases pending in the High Courts stood transferred. Now that exclusive 
jurisdiction is vested in the Banking Tribunal, it is only in that forum that 
bank cases can be tried and, therefore, a provision like Section 31 was 
enacted. 
27. With regard to the observations of the Delhi High Court in relation to 
the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Tribunals and of the Delhi High Court, the 
Act has been enacted for the whole of India. In most of the States, the 
High Courts do not have original jurisdiction. In order to see that the 
Tribunal is not flooded with cases where the amounts involved are not very 
large, the Act provides that it is only where the recovery of the money is 
more than Rs 10 lakhs that the Tribunal will have the jurisdiction to 
entertain the application under Section 19. With respect to suits for 
recovery of money less than Rs 10 lakhs, it is the subordinate courts which 
would continue to try them. In other words, for a claim of Rs 10 lakhs or 
more, exclusive jurisdiction has been conferred on the Tribunal but for any 
amount less than Rs 10 lakhs, it is the ordinary civil courts which will have 
jurisdiction. The bifurcation of original jurisdiction between the Delhi High 
Court and the subordinate courts is a matter which cannot have any 
bearing on the validity of the establishment of the Tribunal. It is only in 
those High Courts which have original jurisdiction that an anomalous 
situation arises where suits for recovery of money less than Rs 10 lakhs 
have to be decided by the High Courts while the Tribunals have jurisdiction 
to decide suits for recovery of more than Rs 10 lakhs. This incongruous 
situation, which can be remedied by the High Court divesting itself of the 
original jurisdiction in regard to such claims and vesting the said 
jurisdiction with the subordinate courts or vice versa, cannot be a ground 
for holding that the Act is invalid.

30. By virtue of Section 29 of the Act, the provisions of the Second and 
Third Schedules to the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Income Tax 
(Certificate Proceedings) Rules, 1962, have become applicable for the 
realisation of the dues by the Recovery Officer. Detailed procedure for 
recovery is contained in these Schedules to the Income Tax Act, including 
provisions relating to arrest and detention of the defaulter. It cannot, 
therefore, be said that the Recovery Officer would act in an arbitrary 
manner. Furthermore, Section 30, after amendment by the Amendment 
Act, 2000, gives a right to any person aggrieved by an order of the 
Recovery Officer, to prefer an appeal to the Tribunal. Thus now an 

112 


Page 113 

appellate forum has been provided against any orders of the Recovery 
Officer which may not be in accordance with law. There is, therefore, 
sufficient safeguard which has been provided in the event of the Recovery 
Officer acting in an arbitrary or an unreasonable manner. The provisions of 
Sections 25 and 28 are, therefore, not bad in law. 
31. For the aforesaid reasons, while allowing the appeals of the Union of 
India and the Banks, we hold that the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and 
Financial Institutions Act, 1993 is a valid piece of legislation. As a result 
thereof, the writ petitions or appeals filed by various parties challenging the 
validity of the said Act or some of the provisions thereof, are dismissed. It 
would be open to the parties to raise other contentions on the merits of 
their cases before the authority constituted under the Act and, only 
thereafter, should a High Court entertain a petition under Articles 226 
and/or 227 of the Constitution. Transferred cases stand disposed of 
accordingly. Parties to bear their own costs." 

(iii) Reliance was next placed on State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House 

Building Cooperative Society & Ors., (2003) 2 SCC 412. The primary question 

which arose for consideration was the constitutional validity of the Consumer 

Protection Act, 1986. The challenge was raised on the ground, that Parliament 

was not empowered to establish a hierarchy of courts like the District Fora, the 

State Commission and the National Commission, as this would constitute a 

parallel hierarchy of courts, in addition to the courts established under the 

Constitution, namely, District Courts, High Courts and the Supreme Court. In this 

behalf the pointed submission was, that Parliament could only establish courts, 

with power to deal with specific subjects, but not such a court which would run 

parallel to the civil courts. It was sought to be asserted, that even under Articles 

323A and 323B of the Constitution, Parliament could not enact a legislation, by 

which it could establish tribunals, in substitution of civil courts including the High 

Court. This, according to those who raised the challenge, would strike at the 

independence of the judiciary. As against the above assertions, the legislative 

113 


Page 114 

competence of the Parliament and the State Legislatures, to provide for creation 

of courts and tribunals, reliance was placed on entries 77, 78 and 79 in List I of 

the Seventh Schedule, as also, entries 11A and 46 contained in List III of the 

Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. While examining the challenge raised to 

the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, on the grounds referred to above, this Court 

held as under:-

"12. A bare perusal of the aforementioned provisions does not leave any 
manner of doubt as regard the legislative competence of Parliament to 
provide for creation of Special Courts and Tribunals. Administration of 
justice; constitution and organization of all courts, except the Supreme 
Court and the High Courts is squarely covered by Entry 11-A of List III of 
the Constitution of India. The said entry was originally a part of Entry 3 of 
List II. By reason of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 
and by Section 57(a)(vi) thereof, it was inserted into List III as Item 11-A. 
13. By virtue of clause (2) of Article 246 of the Constitution, Parliament 
has the requisite power to make laws with respect of constitution of 
organization of all courts except the Supreme Court and the High Court. 
14. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners could not 
seriously dispute the plenary power of Parliament to make a law as regard 
constitution of courts but as noticed supra, merely urged that it did not 
have the competence to create parallel civil courts. 
15. The said submission has been made purported to be relying on or 
on the basis of the following observations made by Shinghal, J. while 
delivering a partially dissenting judgment in Special Courts Bill, 1978, In re: 
(1979) 1 SCC 380 (SCC at p. 455, para 152) 
"152. 
The Constitution has thus made ample and effective provision 
for the establishment of a strong, independent and impartial judicial 
administration in the country, with the necessary complement of civil 
and criminal courts. It is not permissible for Parliament or a State 
Legislature to ignore or bypass that scheme of the Constitution by 
providing for the establishment of a civil or criminal court parallel to a 
High Court in a State, or by way of an additional or extra or a second 
High Court, or a court other than a court subordinate to the High Court. 
Any such attempt would be unconstitutional and will strike at the 
independence of the judiciary which has so nobly been enshrined in the 
Constitution and so carefully nursed over the years." 
16. The argument of the learned counsel is fallacious inasmuch as the 
provisions of the said Act are in addition to the provisions of any other law 

114 


Page 115 

for the time being in force and not in derogation thereof as is evident from 
Section 3 thereof. 
17. The provisions of the said Act clearly demonstrate that it was 
enacted keeping in view the long-felt necessity of protecting the common 
man from wrongs wherefor the ordinary law for all intent and purport had 
become illusory. In terms of the said Act, a consumer is entitled to 
participate in the proceedings directly as a result whereof his helplessness 
against a powerful business house may be taken care of. 
18. This Court in a large number of decisions considered the purport 
and object of the said Act. By reason of the said statute, quasi-judicial 
authorities have been created at the district, State and Central levels so as 
to enable a consumer to ventilate his grievances before a forum where 
justice can be done without any procedural wrangles and 
hypertechnicalities. 
19. One of the objects of the said Act is to provide momentum to the 
consumer movement. The Central Consumer Protection Council is also to 
be constituted in terms of Section 4 of the Act to promote and protect the 
rights of the consumers as noticed hereinbefore. 
xxx

24. In terms of Section 10, the President of a District Forum shall be a 
person who is, or has been, or is qualified to be a District Judge and the 
Forum shall also consist of two other members who are required to be 
persons of ability, integrity and standing and have adequate knowledge or 
experience of, or have shown capacity in dealing with, problems relating to 
economics, law, commerce, accountancy, industry, public affairs or 
administration and one of them shall be a woman. The tenure of the 
members of the District Forum is fixed. 
25. Section 13 of the said Act lays down a detailed procedure as 
regards the mode and manner in which the complaints received by the 
District Forum are required to be dealt with. Section 14 provides for the 
directions which can be issued by the District Forum on arriving at a 
satisfaction that the goods complained against suffer from any of the 
defects specified in the complaint or that any of the allegations contained 
in the complaint about the deficiencies in services have been proved. 
26. Section 15 provides for an appeal from the order made by the 
District Forum to the State Commission. 
27. Section 16 provides for composition of the State Commission which 
reads thus: 
"16. (1) Each State Commission shall consist of,-
(a) a person who is or has been a Judge of a High Court, 
appointed by the State Government, who shall be its President: 
Provided that no appointment under this clause shall be made 
except after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court; 
(b) two other members, who shall be persons of ability, integrity 
and standing and have adequate knowledge or experience of, or 

115 


Page 116 

have shown capacity in dealing with, problems relating to 
economics, law, commerce, accountancy, industry, public affairs 
or administration, one of whom shall be a woman: 
Provided that every appointment under this clause shall be made 
by the State Government on the recommendation of a Selection 
Committee consisting of the following, namely: 
(i) 
President of the State Commission: 
Chairman 
(ii) 
Secretary of the Law Department of the State: Member 
(iii) Secretary in charge of the Department dealing with 
consumer affairs in the State: 
Member 
(2) 
The salary or honorarium and other allowances payable to, 
and the other terms and conditions of service of the members of the 
State Commission shall be such as may be prescribed by the State 
Government. 
(3) 
Every member of the State Commission shall hold office for a 
term of five years or up to the age of sixty-seven years, whichever is 
earlier and shall not be eligible for reappointment. 
(4) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3), a 
person appointed as a President or as a member before the 
commencement of the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Act, 
1993, shall continue to hold such office as President or member, as 
the case may be, till the completion of his term." 
The members of the State Commission are to be selected by a 
Selection Committee, the Chairman whereof would be the President 
of the State Commission. 
28. Section 19 provides for an appeal from a decision of the State 
Commission to the National Commission. Section 20 deals with the 
composition of the National Commission, the President whereof would be 
a person who is or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court and such 
appointment shall be made only upon consultation with the Chief Justice of 
India. So far as the members of the National Commission are concerned, 
the same are also to be made on the recommendation of the Selection 
Committee, the Chairman whereof would be a person who is a Judge of 
the Supreme Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India. The 
tenure of the office of the National Commission is also fixed by reason of 
sub-section (3) of Section 20. 
29. By reason of the provisions of the said Act, therefore, independent 
authorities have been created. 
30. Sections 15, 19 and 23 provide for the hierarchy of appeals. By 
reason of sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 13, the District Forum 
shall have the same powers as are vested in the civil courts for the 
purposes mentioned therein. Sub-sections (2) and (2-A) of Section 14 
mandate that the proceedings shall be conducted by the President of the 
District Forum and at least one member thereof sitting together. Only in the 
event of any difference between them on any point or points, the same is 

116 


Page 117 

to be referred to the other member for hearing thereon and the opinion of 
the majority shall be the order of the District Forum. By reason of Section 
18, the provisions of Sections 12, 13 and 14 and the rules made 
thereunder would mutatis mutandis be applicable to the disposal of 
disputes by the State Commission. 
31. Section 23 provides for a limited appeal to the Supreme Court from 
an order made by the National Commission i.e. when the same is made in 
exercise of its original power as conferred by sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of 
Section 21." 

This Court then, having placed reliance on Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar 

Association (supra), Navinchandra Mafatlal, Bombay v. The Commissioner of 

Income Tax, Bombay City, AIR 1955 SC 58, and Union of India v. Harbhajan 

Singh Dhillon, (1971) 2 SCC 779, concluded as under:-

"37. Once it is held that Parliament had the legislative competence to 
enact the said Act, the submissions of the learned counsel that the 
relevant provisions of the Constitution required amendments must be 
neglected. 
38. The scope and object of the said legislation came up for 
consideration before this Court in Common Cause, A Registered Society v. 
Union of India, (1997) 10 SCC 729. It was held: (SCC p. 730, para 2) 
"2. 
The object of the legislation, as the preamble of the Act 
proclaims, is 'for better protection of the interests of consumers'. 
During the last few years preceding the enactment there was in this 
country a marked awareness among the consumers of goods that 
they were not getting their money's worth and were being exploited 
by both traders and manufacturers of consumer goods. The need for 
consumer redressal fora was, therefore, increasingly felt. 
Understandably, therefore, legislation was introduced and enacted 
with considerable enthusiasm and fanfare as a path-breaking 
benevolent legislation intended to protect the consumer from 
exploitation by unscrupulous manufacturers and traders of consumer 
goods. A three-tier fora comprising the District Forum, the State 
Commission and the National Commission came to be envisaged 
under the Act for redressal of grievances of consumers." 
39. The rights of the parties have adequately been safeguarded by 
reason of the provisions of the said Act inasmuch as although it provides 
for an alternative system of consumer jurisdiction on summary trial, they 
are required to arrive at a conclusion based on reasons. Even when 
quantifying damages, they are required to make an attempt to serve the 
ends of justice aiming not only at recompensing the individual but also to 

117 


Page 118 

bring about a qualitative change in the attitude of the service provider. 
Assignment of reasons excludes or at any rate minimizes the chances of 
arbitrariness and the higher forums created under the Act can test the 
correctness thereof. 
40. The District Forum, the State Commission and the National 
Commission are not manned by lay persons. The President would be a 
person having judicial background and other members are required to 
have the expertise in the subjects such as economics, law, commerce, 
accountancy, industry, public affairs, administration etc. It may be true that 
by reason of sub-section (2-A) of Section 14 of the Act, in a case of 
difference of opinion between two members, the matter has to be referred 
to a third member and, in rare cases, the majority opinion of the members 
may prevail over the President. But, such eventuality alone is insufficient 
for striking down the Act as unconstitutional, particularly, when provisions 
have been made therein for appeal thereagainst to a higher forum. 
41. By reason of the provisions of the said Act, the power of judicial 
review of the High Court, which is a basic feature of the Constitution, has 
not been nor could be taken away. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
49. The question as regards the applicability or otherwise of Articles 
323-A and 323-B of the Constitution in the matter of constitution of such 
Tribunals came up for consideration before this Court in L. Chandra Kumar 
v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261 . This Court therein clearly held that 
the constitutional provisions vest Parliament and the State Legislatures, as 
the case may be, with powers to divest the traditional courts of a 
considerable portion of their judicial work. It was observed that the 
Parliament and the State Legislatures possess legislative competence to 
effect changes in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and High 
Court apart from the authorisation that flows from Articles 323-A and 323-B 
in terms of Entries 77, 78, 79 and 95 of List I so far as the Parliament is 
concerned, and in terms of Entry 65 of List II and Entry 46 of List III so far 
as the State Legislatures are concerned. It was further held that power of 
judicial review being the basic structure of the Constitution cannot be taken 
away. 
50. We, therefore, are clearly of the opinion that the said Act cannot be 
said to be unconstitutional." 

The fourth contention: 

52(i) In response to the fourth contention, namely, the challenge raised by the 

learned counsel for the petitioners, to the various provisions of the NTT Act, it 

was the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents, that in view of 

118 


Page 119 

the submissions advanced in respect of the third contention, it is apparent that 

the Parliament had the legislative competence to enact the NTT Act. It was 

submitted, that the NTT Act was enacted keeping in mind the parameters laid 

down by this Court, by preserving the power of judicial review vested in the High 

Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, as also, by preserving the 

power of judicial review vested in this Court under Articles 32 and 136 of the 

Constitution. It is, therefore, submitted that the final word in respect of the instant 

adjudicatory process, stands preserved with courts of law. And therefore, the 

submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners on 

the individual provisions of the NTT Act, pertaining to the independence of the 

adjudicatory process, were being exaggerated out of proportion. 

(ii) 
Despite having made the above submissions, the Attorney General for 

India, was fair and candid in stating, that if this Court felt that there was need to 

make certain changes in the provisions referred to by the petitioners, he had the 

instructions to state, that any suggestion made by this Court will be viewed 

positively, and necessary amendments in the NTT Act would be carried out. 

The debate, and the consideration: 

I. 
Constitutional validity of the NTT Act -Does the NTT Act violate the "basic 
structure" of the Constitution? 

53. The principal contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for 

the petitioners was premised on the submission, that Article 323B, inserted by 

the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act 1976, to the extent that it 

violated the principles of, "separation of powers", "rule of law", and "judicial 

119 


Page 120 

review", was liable to be struck down. This striking down was founded on an 

alleged violation of the "basic structure" doctrine. Similarly, various provisions of 

the NTT Act, were sought to be assailed. The provisions of the NTT Act were 

challenged, on the premise, that they had trappings of executive control, over the 

adjudicatory process vested with the NTT, and therefore, were liable to be set 

aside as unconstitutional. 

54. In the context of the foregoing submissions advanced at the hands of the 

learned counsel for the petitioners, it is essential for us to examine the exact 

contours of "judicial review", in the framework and scheme, of the concepts of 

"rule of law" and "separation of powers", which have been held to constitute the 

"basic structure" of the Constitution. And also, the essential ingredients, of an 

independent adjudicatory process. It is, therefore, that we would travel the 

ladder of history and law, to determine the exact scope of the "judicial review", 

which constitutes the "basic structure" of the Constitution. This would lead us to 

unravel the salient ingredients of an independent adjudicatory process. Based 

thereon, we will record our conclusions. The analysis: 

55. Reference must first of all be made to the decision rendered by this Court 

in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225. In the above 

cited case, this Court was engaged with the validity of the Constitution (Twenty-

fourth Amendment) Act, 1971, as also, the Constitution (Twenty-fifth 

Amendment) Act, 1971. The former Act related to the amendments of Articles 13 

and 368 of the Constitution, whereas the latter, pertained to the amendment of 

Article 31 of the Constitution. The instant judgment was rendered by a 

120 


Page 121 

constitution bench of 13 Judges. Seven of the Judges expressed the majority 

view. The observations recorded by this Court recognising "judicial review" as a 

component of the "basic structure" of the Constitution, were made by four 

Judges. Reference is first of all being made, to the view expressed by S.M. Sikri, 

CJ.: 

"292. 
The learned Attorney-General said that every provision of the 
Constitution is essential; otherwise it would not have been put in the 
Constitution. This is true. But this does not place every provision of the 
Constitution in the same position. The true position is that every provision of 
the Constitution can be amended provided in the result the basic foundation 
and structure of the constitution remains the same. The basic structure may 
be said to consist of the following features: 
(1) Supremacy of the Constitution; 
(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government; 
(3) Secular character of the Constitution; 
(4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the 
judiciary; 
(5) Federal character of the Constitution. 
293. 
The above structure is built on the basic foundation i.e. the dignity 
and freedom of the individual. This is of supreme importance. This cannot by 
any form of amendment be destroyed." 

It is also imperative to refer to the view expressed by J.M. Shelat and A.N. 

Grover, JJ., who delivered a common judgment: 

"487. .....The Rule of Law has been ensured by providing for judicial review.". 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
577. ….. Judicial review is undertaken by the courts "not out of any desire to 
tilt at legislative authority in a crusader's spirit, but in discharge of a duty 
plainly laid down upon them by the Constitution". The respondents have also 
contended that to let the court have judicial review over constitutional 
amendments would mean involving the court in political questions. To this the 
answer may be given in the words of Lord Porter in Commonwealth of 
Australia v. Bank of New South Wales, 1950 AC 235 at 310,: 
"The problem to be solved will often be not so much legal as political, 
social or economic, yet it must be solved by a Court of law. For where 
the dispute is, as here, not only between Commonwealth and citizen 
but between Commonwealth and intervening States on the one hand 

121 


Page 122 

and citizens and States on the other, it is only the Court that can decide 
the issue, it is vain to invoke the voice of Parliament." 
There is ample evidence in the Constitution itself to indicate that it creates a 
system of checks and balances by reason of which powers are so distributed 
that none of the three organs it sets up can become so pre-dominant as to 
disable the others from exercising and discharging powers and functions 
entrusted to them. Though the Constitution does not lay down the principle of 
separation of powers in all its rigidity as is the case in the United States 
Constitution but it envisages such a separation to a degree as was found in 
Ranasinghe's case, 1965 AC 172. The judicial review provided expressly in 
our Constitution by means of Articles 226 and 32 is one of the features upon 
which hinges the system of checks and balances. Apart from that, as already 
stated, the necessity for judicial decision on the competence or otherwise of 
an Act arises from the very federal nature of a Constitution (per Haldane, L.C. 
in Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia v. Colonial Sugar 
Refining Co., 1914 AC 237 and Ex parte Walsh & Johnson; In re Yates, 
(1925) 37 CLR 36 at page 58. The function of interpretation of a Constitution 
being thus assigned to the judicial power of the State, the question whether 
the subject of a law is within the ambit of one or more powers of the 
Legislature conferred by the Constitution would always be a question of 
interpretation of the Constitution. It may be added that at no stage the 
respondents have contested the proposition that the validity of a constitutional 
amendment can be the subject of review by this Court. The Advocate-General 
of Maharashtra has characterized judicial review as undemocratic. That 
cannot, however, be so in our Constitution because of the provisions relating 
to the appointment of Judges, the specific restriction to which the fundamental 
rights are made subject, the deliberate exclusion of the due process clause in 
Article 21 and the affirmation in Article 141 that Judges declare but not make 
law. To this may be added the none too rigid amendatory process which 
authorizes amendment by means of 2/3 majority and the additional 
requirement of ratification. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
582. 
The basic structure of the Constitution is not a vague concept and 
the apprehensions expressed on behalf of the respondents that neither the 
citizen nor the Parliament would be able to understand it are unfounded. If the 
historical background, the preamble, the entire scheme of the Constitution, 
relevant provisions thereof including Article 368 are kept in mind there can be 
no difficulty in discerning that the following can be regarded as the basic 
elements of the constitutional structure. (These cannot be catalogued but can 
only be illustrated): 
(1) The supremacy of the Constitution. 
(2) Republican and Democratic form of government and sovereignty of 
the country. 
(3) Secular and federal character of the Constitution. 

122 


Page 123 

(4) Demarcation of power between the Legislature, the executive and 
the judiciary. 
(5) The dignity of the individual secured by the various freedoms and 
basic rights in Part III and the mandate to build a welfare State 
contained in Part IV. 
(6) The unity and the integrity of the Nation." 

In this behalf it is also imperative for us to record the observations of P. 

Jaganmohan Reddy, J., who observed as under:-

"1104. …..There is no constitutional matter which is not in some way or the 
other involved with political, social or economic questions, and if the 
Constitution-makers have vested in this Court a power of Judicial review, and 
while so vesting, have given it a prominent place describing it as the heart and 
soul of the Constitution, we will not be deterred from discharging that duty, 
merely because the validity or otherwise of the legislation will affect the 
political or social policy underlying it. The basic approach of this Court has 
been, and must always be, that the Legislature has the exclusive power to 
determine the policy and to translate it into law, the constitutionality of which is 
to be presumed, unless there are strong and cogent reasons for holding that it 
conflicts with the constitutional mandate. In this regard both the Legislature, 
the executive, as well as the judiciary are bound by the paramount instrument, 
and, therefore, no court and no Judge will exercise the judicial power dehors 
that instrument, nor will it function as a supreme legislature above the 
Constitution. The bona fides of all the three of them has been the basic 
assumption, and though all of them may be liable to error, it can be corrected 
in the manner and by the method prescribed under the Constitution and 
subject to such limitations as may be inherent in the instrument." 

Some of the observations of H.R. Khanna, J., are also relevant to the issue in 

hand. The same are placed hereunder: 

"1529. …..The power of judicial review is, however, confined not merely to 
deciding whether in making the impugned laws the Central or State 
Legislatures have acted within the four corners of the legislative lists 
earmarked for them; the courts also deal with the question as to whether the 
laws are made in conformity with and not in violation of the other provisions of 
the Constitution. Our Constitution-makers have provided for fundamental 
rights in Part III and made them justiciable. As long as some fundamental 
rights exist and are a part of the Constitution, the power of judicial review has 
also to be exercised with a view to see that the guarantees afforded by those 
rights are not contravened. Dealing with draft Article 25 (corresponding to 
present Article 32 of the Constitution) by which a right is given to move the 

123 


Page 124 

Supreme Court for enforcement of the fundamental rights, Dr Ambedkar 
speaking in the Constituent Assembly on December 9, 1948 observed: 
" If I was asked to name any particular article in this Constitution as the 
most important an article without which this Constitution would be a 
nullity -I could not refer to any other article except this one It is the 
very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it and I am glad that 
the House has realised its importance" (Constituent Assembly Debates, 
Vol VII, p. 953). 
Judicial review has thus become an integral part of our constitutional system 
and a power has been vested in the High Courts and the Supreme Court to 
decide about the constitutional validity of provisions of statutes. 
Our Constitution postulates rule of law in the sense of supremacy of the 
Constitution and the laws as opposed to arbitrariness. The vesting of power of 
exclusion of judicial review in a legislature, including State Legislature, 
contemplated by Article 31-C, in my opinion, strikes at the basic structure of 
the Constitution. The second part of Article 31-C thus goes beyond the 
permissible limit of what constitutes amendment under Article 368. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
1533. 
The position as it emerges is that it is open to the authority 
amending the Constitution to exclude judicial review regarding the validity of 
an existing statute. It is likewise open to the said authority to exclude judicial 
review regarding the validity of a statute which might be enacted by the 
legislature in future in respect of a specified subject. In such an event, judicial 
review is not excluded for finding whether the statute has been enacted in 
respect of the specified subject. Both the above types of constitutional 
amendments are permissible under Article 368. What is not permissible, 
however, is a third type of constitutional amendment, according to which the 
amending authority not merely excludes judicial review regarding the validity 
of a statute which might be enacted by the legislature in future in respect of a 
specified subject but also excludes judicial review for finding whether the 
statute enacted by the legislature is in respect of the subject for which judicial 
review has been excluded. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
1537. 
I may now sum up my conclusions relating to power of amendment 
under Article 368 of the Constitution as it existed before the amendment made 
by the Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act as well as about the 
validity of the Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, the Constitution 
(Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act and the Constitution (Twenty-ninth 
Amendment) Act: 
(i) Article 368 contains not only the procedure for the amendment of the 
Constitution but also confers the power of amending the Constitution. 
(ii) Entry 97 in List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution does not 
cover the subject of amendment of the Constitution. 
(iii) The word "law" in Article 13(2) does not include amendment of the 
Constitution. It has reference to ordinary piece of legislation. It would also

(vii) The power of amendment under Article 368 does not include the 
power to abrogate the Constitution nor does it include the power to alter 
the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. Subject to the 
retention of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution, the power 
of amendment is plenary and includes within itself the power to amend the 
various articles of the Constitution, including those relating to fundamental 
rights as well as those which may be said to relate to essential features. 
No part of a fundamental right can claim immunity from amendatory 
process by being described as the essence, or core of that right. The 
power of amendment would also include within itself the power to add, 
alter or repeal the various articles.

(xiv) The second part of Article 31-C contains the seed of national 
disintegration and is invalid on the following two grounds: 
(1) It gives a carte blanche to the legislature to make any law 
violative of Articles 14, 19 and 31 and make it immune from attack by 
inserting the requisite declaration. Article 31-C taken along with its 
second part gives in effect the power to the legislature including a State 
Legislature, to amend the Constitution in important respects. 
(2) 
The legislature has been made the final authority to decide as to 
whether the law made by it is for the objects mentioned in Article 31-C. 
The vice of second part of Article 31-C lies in the fact that even if the 
law enacted is not for the object mentioned in Article 31-C, the 
declaration made by the legislature precludes a party from showing that 
the law is not for that object and prevents a court from going into the 
question as to whether the law enacted is really for that object. The 
exclusion by the legislature, including a State Legislature, of even that 
limited judicial review strikes at the basic structure of the Constitution. 
The second part of Article 31-C goes beyond the permissible limit of 
what constitutes amendment under Article 368. 
The second part of Article 31-C can be severed from the 
remaining part of Article 31-C and its invalidity would not affect the 
validity of the remaining part. I would, therefore, strike down the 
following words in Article 31-C --
" and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such 
policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it 
does not give effect to such policy"." 

56(i) The next judgment having a bearing on the subject is Smt. Indira Nehru 

Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain, 1975 Supp. SCC 1. In the instant judgment, this 

125 


Page 126 

Court examined the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Thirty-ninth 

Amendment) Act, 1975. The issue under reference included the insertion of 

Article 329A (and more particularly, the second clause thereof), which had the 

effect of taking out from the purview of "judicial review", the validity of the election 

of a person who was holding, either the office of the Prime Minister or of the 

Speaker, or had come to be appointed/chosen as the Prime Minister or the 

Speaker, after such election. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is 

concerned, it would be relevant to mention, that the election of the appellant from 

the Rae Bareli constituency in the General Parliamentary Elections of 1971, was 

set aside by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (hereinafter referred to as, 

the High Court), on 12.6.1975. The appellant had assailed the order passed by 

the High Court before this Court. During the pendency of the above appeal, on 

10.8.1975, the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act was passed, which 

introduced two new Articles, namely, Articles 71 and 329A of the Constitution. 

The controversy arising out of the above referred appeal, therefore, virtually 

came to be rendered infructuous. It was, by way of a cross-appeal, that the 

constitutional validity of the amended provisions was assailed. 

(ii) 
In the above cross-appeal, it was asserted at the hands of the respondent, 

that "judicial review" was an essential feature of the "basic structure" of the 

Constitution. This assertion was under the doctrine of "separation of powers". 

The pointed submission at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondent 

was, that "judicial review", in matters of election was imperative. The issue 

canvassed was, that "judicial review" would ensure free, fair and pure elections. 

126 


Page 127 

It was sought to be asserted, that the power of "judicial review" in the context 

referred to hereinabove, was available both under the American Constitution, as 

also, the Australian Constitution. And therefore, even though there was no 

express/clear provision on the subject under the Indian Constitution, since the 

executive, the legislature and the judiciary were earmarked respective spheres of 

activity (by compartmentalising them into separate parts and chapters), the charge 

and onus of "judicial review" fell within the sphere of activity of the judiciary. It 

was sought to be asserted, that under Article 136 of the Constitution, all tribunals 

and courts are amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court. The corollary sought to 

be drawn was, that if under clause 4 of Article 329A of the Constitution, the 

power of "judicial review" was taken away, it would amount to a destruction of the 

"basic structure" of the Constitution. The relevant observations made in the 

instant judgment rendered by a constitution bench of 5 Judges of this Court are 

being extracted hereunder. First and foremost reference may be made to the 

following observations of A.N. Ray, CJ:-

"16. It should be stated here that the hearing has proceeded on the 
assumption that it is not necessary to challenge the majority view in 
Kesavananda Bharati's case, (1973) 4 SCC 225. The contentions of the 
respondent are these: First, under Article 368 only general principles 
governing the organs of the State and the basic principles can be laid down. 
An amendment of the Constitution does not contemplate any decision in 
respect of individual cases. Clause (4) of Article 329-A is said to be exercise 
of a purely judicial power which is not included in the constituent power 
conferred by Article 368. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
20. Fifth, clause (4) destroys not only judicial review but also separation of 
power. The order of the High Court declaring the election to be void is 
declared valid (lie void). The cancellation of the judgment is denial of political 
justice which is the basic structure of the Constitution. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 

127

52. Judicial review in election disputes is not a compulsion. Judicial review 
of decisions in election disputes may be entrusted by law to a judicial tribunal. 
If it is to a tribunal or to the High Court the judicial review will be attracted 
either under the relevant law providing for appeal to this Court or Article 136 
may be attracted. Under Article 329(b) the contemplated law may vest the 
power to entertain election petitions in the House itself which may determine 
the dispute by a resolution after receiving a report from a special committee. 
In such cases judicial review may be eliminated without involving amendment 
of the Constitution. ….. If judicial review is excluded the court is not in a 
position to conclude that principles of equality have been violated. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
153. The contentions of the respondent that the Amendment Acts of 1974 
and 1975 are subject to basic features or basic structure or basic framework 
fails on two grounds. First, legislative measures are not subject to the theory 
of basic features or basic structure or basic framework. Second, the majority 
view in Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra) is that the Twenty-ninth 
Amendment which put the two statutes in the Ninth Schedule and Article 31-B 
is not open to challenge on the ground of either damage to or destruction of 
basic features, basic structure or basic framework or on the ground of 
violation of fundamental rights." 

The views expressed by H.R. Khanna, J. are now being reproduced below:-

"175. The prop osition that the power of amendment under Article 368 does 
not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure of framework of the 
Constitution was laid down by this Court by a majority of 7 to 6 in the case of 
His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225. 
Apart from other reasons which were given in some of the judgments of the 
learned Judges who constituted the majority, the majority dealt with the 
connotation of the word "amendment". It was held that the words "amendment 
of the Constitution" in Article 368 could not have the effect of destroying or 
abrogating the basic structure of the Constitution. Some of us who were 
parties to that case took a different view and came to the conclusion that the 
words "amendment of the Constitution" in Article 368 did not admit of any 
limitation. Those of us who were in the minority in Kesavananda Bharati's 
case (supra) may still hold the same view as was given expression to in that 
case. For the purpose of the present case, we shall have to proceed in 
accordance with the law as laid down by the majority in that case. 
176. 
Before dealing with the question as to whether the impugned 
amendment affects the basic structure of the Constitution, I may make it clear 
that this Court is not concerned with the wisdom behind or the propriety of the 
impugned constitutional amendment. These are matters essentially for those 
who are vested with the authority to make the constitutional amendment. All 
that this Court is concerned with is the constitutional validity of the impugned 
amendment. 

128

210. 
It has been argued in support of the constitutional validity of clause (4) 
that as a result of this amendment, the validity of one election has been 
preserved. Since the basic structure of the Constitution, according to the 
submission, continues to be the same, clause (4) cannot be said to be an 
impermissible piece of constitutional amendment. The argument has a 
seeming plausibility about it, but a deeper reflection would show that it is 
vitiated by a basic fallacy. Law normally connotes a rule or norm which is of 
general application. It may apply to all the persons or class of persons or even 
individuals of a particular description. Law prescribes the abstract principles 
by the application of which individual cases are decided. Law, however, is not 
what Blackstone called "a sentence". According to Roscoe Pound, law, as 
distinguished from laws, is the system of authoritative materials for grounding 
or guiding judicial and administrative action recognised or established in a 
politically organized society (see p. 106, Jurisprudence, Vol. III). Law is not 
the same as judgment. Law lays down the norm in abstract terms with a 
coercive power and sanction against those guilty of violating the norm, while 
judgment represents the decision arrived at by the application of law to the 
concrete facts of a case. Constitutional law relates to the various organs of a 
State; it deals with the structure of the Government, the extent of distribution 
of its powers and the modes and principles of its operation. The Constitution 
of India is so detailed that some of the matters which in a brief Constitution 
like that of the United States of America are dealt with by statutes form the 
subject-matter of various articles of our Constitution. There is, however, in a 
constitutional law, as there is in the very idea of law, some element of 
generality or general application. It also carries with it a concept of its 
applicability in future to situations which may arise in that context. If there is 
amendment of some provision of the Constitution and the amendment deals 
with matters which constitute constitutional law, in the normally accepted 
sense, the court while deciding the question of the validity of the amendment 
would have to find out, in view of the majority opinion in Kesavananda 
Bharati's case (supra), as to whether the amendment affects the basic 
structure of the Constitution. The constitutional amendment contained in 
clause (4) with which we are concerned in the present case is, however, of an 
altogether different nature. Its avowed object is to confer validity on the 
election of the appellant to the Lok Sabha in 1971 after that election had been 
declared to be void by the High Court and an appeal against the judgment of 
the High Court was pending in this Court. In spite of our query, we were not 
referred to any precedent of a similar amendment of any Constitution of the 
world. The uniqueness of the impugned constitutional amendment would not, 
however, affect its validity. If the constituent authority in its wisdom has 
chosen the validity of a disputed election as the subject-matter of a 
constitutional amendment, this Court cannot go behind that wisdom. All that 
this Court is concerned with is the validity of the amendment. I need not go 
into the question as to whether such a matter, in view of the normal concept of 

129 


Page 130 

constitutional law, can strictly be the subject of a constitutional amendment. I 
shall for the purpose of this case assume that such a matter can validly be the 
subject-matter of a constitutional amendment. The question to be decided is 
that if the impugned amendment of the Constitution violates a principle which 
is part of the basic structure of the Constitution, can it enjoy immunity from an 
attack on its validity because of the fact that for the future, the basic structure 
of the Constitution remains unaffected. The answer to the above question, in 
my opinion, should be in the negative. What has to be seen in such a matter 
is whether the amendment contravenes or runs counter to an imperative rule 
or postulate which is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution. 
If so, it would be an impermissible amendment and it would make no 
difference whether it relates to one case or a large number of cases. If an 
amendment striking at the basic structure of the Constitution is not 
permissible, it would not acquire validity by being related only to one case. To 
accede to the argument advanced in support of the validity of the amendment 
would be tantamount to holding that even though it is not permissible to 
change the basic structure of the Constitution, whenever the authority 
concerned deems it proper to make such an amendment, it can do so and 
circumvent the bar to the making of such an amendment by confining it to one 
case. What is prohibited cannot become permissible because of its being 
confined to one matter." 

On the issue in hand, K.K. Mathew, J.'s views were as under:-

"318. The major problem of human society is to combine that degree of 
liberty without which law is tyranny with that degree of law without which 
liberty becomes licence; and, the difficulty has been to discover the practical 
means of achieving this grand objective and to find the opportunity for 
applying these means in the ever-shifting tangle of human affairs. A large part 
of the effort of man over centuries has been expended in seeking a solution of 
this great problem. A region of law, in contrast to the tyranny of power, can be 
achieved only through separating appropriately the several powers of the 
Government. If the lawmakers should also be the constant administrators and 
dispensers of law and justice, then, the people would be left without a remedy 
in case of injustice since no appeal can lie under the fiat against such a 
supremacy. And, in this age-old search of political philosophers for the secret 
of sound Government, combined with individual liberty, it was Montesquieu 
who first saw the light. He was the first among the political philosophers who 
saw the necessity of separating judicial power from the executive and 
legislative branches of Government. Montesquieu was the first to conceive of 
the three functions of Government as exercised by three organs, each 
juxtaposed against others. He realised that the efficient operation of 
Government involved a certain degree of overlapping and that the theory of 
checks and balances required each organ to impede too great an 
aggrandizement of authority by the other two powers. As Holdsworth says, 
Montesquieu convinced the world that he had discovered a new constitutional 

130 


Page 131 

principle which was universally valid. The doctrine of separation of 
governmental powers is not a mere theoretical, philosophical concept. It is a 
practical, work-a-day principle. The division of Government into three 
branches does not imply, as its critics would have us think, three watertight 
compartments. Thus, legislative impeachment of executive officers or judges, 
executive veto over legislation, judicial review of administrative or legislative 
actions are treated as partial exceptions which need explanation. (See 
generally: "the Doctrine of Separation of Powers and its present day 
significance" by T. Vanderbilt.) 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
343. 
I think clause (4) is bad for the reasons which I have already 
summarised. Clauses (1) to (3) of Article 329-A are severable but I express no 
opinion on their validity as it is not necessary for deciding this case. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
361. 
I therefore hold that these Acts are not liable to be challenged on any 
of the grounds argued by Counsel." 

57. Insofar as the third judgment in the series of judgments is concerned, 

reference may be made to Minerva Mills Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., 

(1980) 2 SCC 591, as also, Minerva Mills Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., 

(1980) 3 SCC 625. Insofar as the former of the above two judgments is 

concerned, the same delineates the pointed controversy dealt with by a 

constitution bench of 5 Judges of this Court. The issue adjudicated upon, 

pertained to the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Forty-second 

Amendment) Act, 1976, and more particularly, Sections 4 and 55 thereof, 

whereby Articles 31C and 368 of the Constitution, came to be amended. The 

majority view was expressed in the ratio of 4:1, P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then 

was) having rendered the dissent. The majority arrived at the conclusion, that 

Section 4 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 was beyond 

the amending power of the Parliament and was void, as it had the effect of 

violating the basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroying the 

131 


Page 132 

"basic structure" of the Constitution, by a total exclusion of a challenge to any 

law, even on the ground that it was inconsistent with, or had taken away, or had 

abridged any of the rights, conferred by Articles 14 or 19 of the Constitution. 

Likewise, Section 55 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act was 

struck down as unconstitutional, as the same was beyond the amending power of 

the Parliament. 
Relevant observations recorded in the instant judgment 

pertaining to the issue in hand, are being extracted hereunder. The opinion 

expressed by Y.V. Chandrachud, CJ, A.C. Gupta, N.L. Untawalia and P.S. 

Kailasam, JJ. on the subject in hand, was to the following effect:-

"68. 
We must … mention, what is perhaps not fully realised, that Article 31-
C speaks of laws giving effect to the "policy of the State", "towards securing all 
or any of the principles laid down in Part IV". In the very nature of things it is 
difficult for a court to determine whether a particular law gives effect to a 
particular policy. Whether a law is adequate enough to give effect to the policy 
of the State towards securing a directive principle is always a debatable 
question and the courts cannot set aside the law as invalid merely because, in 
their opinion, the law is not adequate enough to give effect to a certain policy. 
In fact, though the clear intendment of Article 31-C is to shut out all judicial 
review, the argument of the learned Additional Solicitor-General calls for a 
doubly or trebly extensive judicial review than is even normally permissible to 
the courts. Be it remembered that the power to enquire into the question 
whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus between the provisions of a 
law and a directive principle cannot confer upon the courts the power to sit in 
judgment over the policy itself of the State. At the highest, courts can, under 
Article 31-C, satisfy themselves as to the identity of the law in the sense 
whether it bears direct and reasonable nexus with a directive principle. If the 
court is satisfied as to the existence of such nexus, the inevitable 
consequence provided for by Article 31-C must follow. Indeed, if there is one 
topic on which all the 13 Judges in Kesavananda Bharati, (1973) 4 SCC 225, 
were agreed, it is this: that the only question open to judicial review under the 
unamended Article 31-C was whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus 
between the impugned law and the provisions of Article 39(b) and (c) 
Reasonableness is evidently regarding the nexus and not regarding the law. It 
is therefore impossible to accept the contention that it is open to the courts to 
undertake the kind of enquiry suggested by the Additional Solicitor General. 

132 


Page 133 

The attempt therefore to drape Article 31-C into a democratic outfit under 
which an extensive judicial review would be permissible must fail. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
73. 
It was finally urged by the learned Attorney General that if we uphold 
the challenge to the validity of Article 31-C, the validity of clauses (2) to (6) of 
Article 19 will be gravely imperilled because those clauses will also then be 
liable to be struck down as abrogating the rights conferred by Article 19(1) 
which are an essential feature of the Constitution. We are unable to accept 
this contention. Under clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19, restrictions can be 
imposed only if they are reasonable and then again, they can be imposed in 
the interest of a stated class of subjects only. It is for the courts to decide 
whether restrictions are reasonable and whether they are in the interest of the 
particular subject. Apart from other basic dissimilarities, Article 31-C takes 
away the power of judicial review to an extent which destroys even the 
semblance of a comparison between its provisions and those of clauses (2) to 
(6) of Article 19. Human ingenuity, limitless though it may be, has yet not 
devised a system by which the liberty of the people can be protected except 
through the intervention of courts of law. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
75. 
These then are our reasons for the Order (See Minerva Mills Ltd. vs. 
Union of India, (1980) 2 SCC 591) which we passed on May 9, 1980 to the 
following effect: (SCC pp. 592-593, paras 1 & 2) 

"Section 4 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act is beyond 
the amending power of the Parliament and is void since it damages the 
basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroys its basic 
structure by a total exclusion of challenge to any law on the ground that 
it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights 
conferred by Article 14 or Article 19 of the Constitution, if the law is for 
giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing all or any of the 
principles laid down in Part IV of the Constitution. 
Section 55 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act is beyond 
the amending power of the Parliament and is void since it removes all 
limitations on the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution 
and confers power upon it to amend the Constitution so as to damage 
or destroy its basic or essential features or its basic structure." 

In order to appreciate the minority view on the issue, reference may be made to 

the following observations of P.N. Bhagwati, J.:-

"87. 
It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional scheme, and I have 
pointed this out in the preceding paragraph, that every organ of the State, 
every authority under the Constitution, derives its power from the Constitution 
and has to act within the limits of such power. But then the question arises as 

133 


Page 134 

to which authority must decide what are the limits on the power conferred 
upon each organ or instrumentality of the State and whether such limits are 
transgressed or exceeded. Now there are three main departments of the 
State amongst which the powers of government are divided; the executive, 
the legislature and the judiciary. Under our Constitution we have no rigid 
separation of powers as in the United States of America, but there is a broad 
demarcation, though, having regard to the complex nature of governmental 
functions, certain degree of overlapping is inevitable. The reason for this 
broad separation of powers is that "the concentration of powers in any one 
organ may" to quote the words of Chandrachud, J., (as he then was) in Indira 
Gandhi case, 1975 Supp SCC 1, "by upsetting that fine balance between the 
three organs, destroy the fundamental premises of a democratic government 
to which we are pledged". Take for example, a case where the executive 
which is in charge of administration acts to the prejudice of a citizen and a 
question arises as to what are the powers of the executive and whether the 
executive has acted within the scope of its powers. Such a question obviously 
cannot be left to the executive to decide and for two very good reasons. First, 
the decision of the question would depend upon the interpretation of the 
Constitution and the laws and this would pre-eminently be a matter fit to be 
decided by the judiciary, because it is the judiciary which alone would be 
possessed of expertise in this field and secondly, the constitutional and legal 
protection afforded to the citizen would become illusory, if it were left to the 
executive to determine the legality of its own action. So also if the legislature 
makes a law and a dispute arises whether in making the law the legislature 
has acted outside the area of its legislative competence or the law is violative 
of the fundamental rights or of any other provisions of the Constitution, its 
resolution cannot, for the same reasons, be left to the determination of the 
legislature. The Constitution has, therefore, created an independent 
machinery for resolving these disputes and this independent machinery is the 
judiciary which is vested with the power of judicial review to determine the 
legality of executive action and the validity of legislation passed by the 
legislature. It is the solemn duty of the judiciary under the Constitution to keep 
the different organs of the State such as the executive and the legislature 
within the limits of the power conferred upon them by the Constitution. This 
power of judicial review is conferred on the judiciary by Articles 32 and 226 of 
the Constitution. Speaking about draft Article 25, corresponding to present 
Article 32 of the Constitution, Dr Ambedkar, the principal architect of our 
Constitution, said in the Constituent Assembly on December 9, 1948: 
"If I was asked to name any particular Article in this Constitution as the 
most important -an Article without which this Constitution would be a 
nullity -I could not refer to any other Article except this one. It is the 
very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it and I am glad that 
the House has realised its importance. (CAD, Vol. 7, p.953)" 
It is a cardinal principle of our Constitution that no one howsoever highly 
placed and no authority however lofty can claim to be the sole judge of its 

134 


Page 135 

power under the Constitution or whether its action is within the confines of 
such power laid down by the Constitution. The judiciary is the interpreter of 
the Constitution and to the judiciary is assigned the delicate task to determine 
what is the power conferred on each branch of government, whether it is 
limited, and if so, what are the limits and whether any action of that branch 
transgresses such limits. It is for the judiciary to uphold the constitutional 
values and to enforce the constitutional limitations. That is the essence of the 
rule of law, which inter alia requires that "the exercise of powers by the 
government whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other 
authority, be conditioned by the Constitution and the law". The power of 
judicial review is an integral part of our constitutional system and without it, 
there will be no government of laws and the rule of law would become a 
teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. I am of the view that if there is one 
feature of our Constitution which, more than any other, is basic and 
fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law, it is the 
power of judicial review and it is unquestionably, to my mind, part of the basic 
structure of the Constitution. Of course, when I say this I should not be taken 
to suggest that effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements 
for judicial review cannot be made by Parliament. But what I wish to 
emphasise is that judicial review is a vital principle of our Constitution and it 
cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic structure of the Constitution. If 
by a constitutional amendment, the power of judicial review is taken away and 
it is provided that the validity of any law made by the legislature shall not be 
liable to be called in question on any ground, even if it is outside the 
legislative competence of the legislature or is violative of any fundamental 
rights, it would be nothing short of subversion of the Constitution, for it would 
make a mockery of the distribution of legislative powers between the Union 
and the States and render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile. So 
also if a constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of taking 
away the power of judicial review and providing that no amendment made in 
the Constitution shall be liable to be questioned on any ground, even if such 
amendment is violative of the basic structure and, therefore, outside the 
amendatory power of Parliament, it would be making Parliament sole judge of 
the constitutional validity of what it has done and that would, in effect and 
substance, nullify the limitation on the amending power of Parliament and 
affect the basic structure of the Constitution. The conclusion must therefore 
inevitably follow that clause (4) of Article 368 is unconstitutional and void as 
damaging the basic structure of the Constitution. 
88. 
That takes us to clause (5) of Article 368. This clause opens with the 
words "for the removal of doubts" and proceeds to declare that there shall be 
no limitation whatever on the amending power of Parliament under Article 
368. It is difficult to appreciate the meaning of the opening words "for the 
removal of doubts" because the majority decision in Kesavananda Bharati 
case (supra) clearly laid down and left no doubt that the basic structure of the 
Constitution was outside the competence of the amendatory power of 

135 


Page 136 

Parliament and in Indira Gandhi case (supra), all the judges unanimously 
accepted theory of the basic structure as a theory by which the validity of the 
amendment impugned before them, namely, Article 329-A(4) was to be 
judged. Therefore, after the decisions in Kesavananda Bharati case (supra) 
and Indira Gandhi case (supra), there was no doubt at all that the amendatory 
power of Parliament was limited and it was not competent to Parliament to 
alter the basic structure of the Constitution and clause (5) could not remove 
the doubt which did not exist. What clause (5) really sought to do was to 
remove the limitation on the amending power of Parliament and convert it 
from a limited power into an unlimited one. This was clearly and indubitably a 
futile exercise on the part of Parliament. I fail to see how Parliament which 
has only a limited power of amendment and which cannot alter the basic 
structure of the Constitution can expand its power of amendment so as to 
confer upon itself the power of repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to 
damage or destroy its basic structure. That would clearly be in excess of the 
limited amending power possessed by Parliament. The Constitution has 
conferred only a limited amending power on Parliament so that it cannot 
damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution and Parliament 
cannot by exercise of that limited amending power convert that very power 
into an absolute and unlimited power. If it were permissible to Parliament to 
enlarge the limited amending power conferred upon it into an absolute power 
of amendment, then it was meaningless to place a limitation on the original 
power of amendment. It is difficult to appreciate how Parliament having a 
limited power of amendment can get rid of the limitation by exercising that 
very power and convert it into an absolute power. Clause (5) of Article 368 
which sought to remove the limitation on the amending power of Parliament 
by making it absolute must therefore be held to be outside the amending 
power of Parliament. There is also another ground on which the validity of this 
clause can be successfully assailed. This clause seeks to convert a controlled 
Constitution into an uncontrolled one by removing the limitation on the 
amending power of Parliament which, as pointed out above, is itself an 
essential feature of the Constitution and it is therefore violative of the basic 
structure. I would in the circumstances hold clause (5) of Article 368 to be 
unconstitutional and void." 

58. Reference may now be made to another decision of this Court rendered by 

a bench of 7 Judges, namely, S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, 1981 (Supp.) SCC 

87. P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) opined as under:-

"Concept of Independence of the Judiciary 
27. 
Having disposed of the preliminary objection in regard to locus standi 
of the petitioners, we may now proceed to consider the questions which arise 

136 


Page 137 

for determination in these writ petitions. The questions are of great 
constitutional significance affecting the principle of independence of the 
judiciary which is a basic feature of the Constitution and we would therefore 
prefer to begin the discussion by making a few prefatory remarks highlighting 
what the true function of the judiciary should be in a country like India which is 
marching along the road to social justice with the banner of democracy and 
the rule of law, for the principle of independence of the judiciary is not an 
abstract conception but it is a living faith which must derive its inspiration from 
the constitutional charter and its nourishment and sustenance from the 
constitutional values. It is necessary for every Judge to remember constantly 
and continually that our Constitution is not a non-aligned national charter. It is 
a document of social revolution which casts an obligation on every 
instrumentality including the judiciary, which is a separate but equal branch of 
the State, to transform the status quo ante into a new human order in which 
justice, social, economic and political will inform all institutions of national life 
and there will be equality of status and opportunity for all. …..Now this 
approach to the judicial function may be alright for a stable and static society 
but not for a society pulsating with urges of gender justice, worker justice, 
minorities justice, dalit justice and equal justice, between chronic unequals. 
Where the contest is between those who are socially or economically 
unequal, the judicial process may prove disastrous from the point of view of 
social justice, if the Judge adopts a merely passive or negative role and does 
not adopt a positive and creative approach. The judiciary cannot remain a 
mere bystander or spectator but it must become an active participant in the 
judicial process ready to use law in the service of social justice through a pro-
active goal-oriented approach. But this cannot be achieved unless we have 
judicial cadres who share the fighting faith of the Constitution and who are 
imbued with the constitutional values. The necessity of a judiciary which is in 
tune with the social philosophy of the Constitution has nowhere been better 
emphasised than in the words of Justice Krishna Iyer which we quote: 
"Appointment of Judges is a serious process where judicial expertise, 
legal learning, life's experience and high integrity are components, but 
above all are two indispensables -social philosophy in active unison 
with the socialistic articles of the Constitution, and second, but equally 
important, built-in resistance to pushes and pressures by class 
interests, private prejudices, government threats and blandishments, 
party loyalties and contrary economic and politicial ideologies projecting 
into pronouncements. (Mainstream, November 22, 1980)" 
Justice Krishna Iyer goes on to say in his inimitable style: 
"Justice Cardozo approvingly quoted President Theodore Roosevelt's 
stress on the social philosophy of the Judges, which shakes and 
shapes the course of a nation and, therefore, the choice of Judges for 
the higher Courts which makes and declares the law of the land, must 
be in tune with the social philosophy of the Constitution. Not mastery of 
the law alone, but social vision and creative craftsmanship are 

137 


Page 138 

important inputs in successful justicing. (Mainstream, November 22, 
1980)" 
What is necessary is to have Judges who are prepared to fashion new tools, 
forge new methods, innovate new strategies and evolve a new jurisprudence, 
who are judicial statesmen with a social vision and a creative faculty and who 
have, above all, a deep sense of commitment to the Constitution with an 
activist approach and obligation for accountability, not to any party in power 
nor to the opposition nor to the classes which are vociferous but to the half-
hungry millions of India who are continually denied their basic human rights. 
We need Judges who are alive to the socio-economic realities of Indian life, 
who are anxious to wipe every tear from every eye, who have faith in the 
constitutional values and who are ready to use law as an instrument for 
achieving the constitutional objectives. This has to be the broad blueprint of 
the appointment project for the higher echelons of judicial service. It is only if 
appointments of Judges are made with these considerations weighing 
predominantly with the appointing authority that we can have a truly 
independent judiciary committed only to the Constitution and to the people of 
India. The concept of independence of the judiciary is a noble concept which 
inspires the constitutional scheme and constitutes the foundation on which 
rests the edifice of our democratic polity. If there is one principle which runs 
through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the rule of law 
and under the Constitution, it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task 
of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby 
making the rule of law meaningful and effective. It is to aid the judiciary in this 
task that the power of judicial review has been conferred upon the judiciary 
and it is by exercising this power which constitutes one of the most potent 
weapons in armory of the law, that the judiciary seeks to protect the citizen 
against violation of his constitutional or legal rights or misuse or abuse of 
power by the State or its officers. The judiciary stands between the citizen and 
the State as a bulwark against executive excesses and misuse or abuse of 
power by the executive and therefore it is absolutely essential that the 
judiciary must be free from executive pressure or influence and this has been 
secured by the Constitution-makers by making elaborate provisions in the 
Constitution to which detailed reference has been made in the judgments in 
Union of India vs. Sankalchand Himmatlal Sheth, (1977) 4 SCC 193. But it is 
necessary to remind ourselves that the concept of independence of the 
judiciary is not limited only to independence from executive pressure or 
influence but it is a much wider concept which takes within its sweep 
independence from many other pressures and prejudices. It has many 
dimensions, namely, fearlessness of other power centres, economic or 
political, and freedom from prejudices acquired and nourished by the class to 
which the Judges belong. If we may again quote the eloquent words of Justice 
Krishna Iyer: 
"Independence of the Judiciary is not genuflexion; nor is it opposition 
to every proposition of Government. It is neither Judiciary made to 

138 


Page 139 

Opposition measure nor Government's pleasure. (Mainstream, 
November 22, 1980) 
The tycoon, the communalist, the parochialist, the faddist, the 
extremist and radical reactionary lying coiled up and subconsciously 
shaping judicial mentations are menaces to judicial independence 
when they are at variance with Parts III and IV of the Paramount 
Parchment." 
Judges should be of stern stuff and tough fibre, unbending before power, 
economic or political, and they must uphold the core principle of the rule of 
law which says, "Be you ever so high, the law is above you." This is the 
principle of independence of the judiciary which is vital for the establishment 
of real participatory democracy, maintenance of the rule of law as a dynamic 
concept and delivery of social justice to the vulnerable sections of the 
community. It is this principle of independence of the judiciary which we must 
keep in mind while interpreting the relevant provisions of the Constitution." 

S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, J., on the issue of "judicial review" and the "basic structure", 

opined as under:-

"332. It would appear that our Constitution has devised a wholesome and 
effective mechanism for the appointment of Judges which strikes a just 
balance between the judicial and executive powers so that while the final 
appointment vests in the highest authority of the executive, the power is 
subject to a mandatory consultative process which by convention is entitled to 
great weight by the President. Apart from these safety valves, checks and 
balances at every stage, where the power of the President is abused or 
misused or violates any of the constitutional safeguards it is always subject to 
judicial review. The power of judicial review, which has been conceded by the 
Constitution to the judiciary, is in our opinion the safest possible safeguard not 
only to ensure independence of judiciary but also to prevent it from the 
vagaries of the executive. Another advantage of the method adopted by our 
Constitution is that by vesting the entire power in the President, the following 
important elements are introduced: 
(1) 
a popular element in the matter of administration of justice, 
(2) 
linking with judicial system the dynamic goals of a progressive 
society by subjecting the principles of governance to be guided by the 
Directive Principles of State Policy, 
(3) 
in order to make the judiciary an effective and powerful machinery, 
the Constitution contains a most onerous and complicated system by 
which Judges can be removed under Article 124(4), which in practice is 
almost an impossibility, 
(4) 
in order to create and subserve democratic processes the power of 
appointment of the judiciary in the executive has been so vested that the 

139 


Page 140 

head of the executive which functions through the Council of Ministers, 
which is a purely elected body, is made accountable to the people. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
336. 
This Court has in several cases held that the condition of consultation 
which the Governor has to exercise implies that he would have to respect the 
recommendations of the High Court and cannot turn it down without cogent 
reasons and even if he does so, it is manifest that his order is always subject 
to judicial review on the ground of mala fide or exceeding his jurisdiction. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
345. 
This, therefore, disposes of all the contentions of the counsel for the 
parties so far as the various aspects of interpretation of Article 222 are 
concerned. On a consideration, therefore, of the facts, circumstances and 
authorities the position is as follows: 
(1) that Article 222 expressly excludes 'consent' and it is not possible to 
read the word 'consent' into Article 222 and thereby whittle down the 
power conferred on the President under this Article, 
(2) that the transfer of a Judge or a C.J. of a High Court under Article 222 
must be made in public interest or national interest, 
(3) that non-consensual transfer does not amount to punishment or 
involve any stigma, 
(4) that in suitable cases where mala fide is writ large on the face of it, an 
order of transfer made by the President would be subject to judicial review, 
(5) that the transfer of a Judge from one High Court to another does not 
amount to a first or fresh appointment in any sense of the term, 
(6) that a transfer made under Article 222 after complying with the 
conditions and circumstances mentioned above does not mar or erode the 
independence of judiciary. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
402. 
It has been vehemently argued by Mr. Seervai as also by Mr. 
Sorabjee who followed him that their main concern is that independence of 
judiciary should be maintained at all costs. Indeed, if they are really 
concerned that we should build up an independent judiciary then it is 
absolutely essential that new talents from outside should be imported in every 
High Court either to man it or to head it so that they may generate much 
greater confidence in the people than the local Judges. The position of a C.J. 
is indeed a very high constitutional position and our Constitution contains 
sufficient safeguards to protect both his decision-making process and his 
tenure. It is a well-known saying that power corrupts and absolute power 
corrupts absolutely. As man is not infallible, so is a Chief Justice, though a 
person holding a high judicial post is likely to be incorruptible because of the 
quality of sobriety and restraint that the judicial method contains. Even so, if a 
C.J. is from outside the State, the chances of his misusing his powers are 
reduced to the absolute minimum. We have pointed out that the power to 
formulate or evolve this policy clearly lies within the four-corners of Article 222 
itself which contains a very wide power conditioned only by consultation with 

140 


Page 141 

C.J.I. who is the highest judicial authority in the country. It is always open to 
the President, which in practice means the Central Government, to lay down a 
policy, norms and guidelines according to which the presidential powers are to 
be exercised and once these norms are followed, the powers of the President 
would be beyond judicial review." 

On the issue in hand, V.D. Tulzapurkar, J. expressed the following view:-

"624. 
As regards the constitutional convention or practice and the 
undertaking which have been pressed into service in relation to Bar recruits 
as Additional Judges for basing their right to be considered for their 
continuance on the expiry of their initial term, the learned Attorney-General 
appearing for the Union of India raised a two fold contention. Regarding the 
former he urged that a constitutional convention or practice, howsoever 
wholesome, cannot affect, alter or control the plain meaning of Article 224(1) 
which according to him gives absolute power and complete discretion to the 
President in the matter of continuance of sitting Additional Judges on the 
expiry of their initial term, the pendency of arrears being relevant only for 
deciding whether or not Additional Judges should be appointed and not 
relevant with regard to a particular person to be appointed. As regards the 
undertaking he pointed out that the usual undertaking obtained from a 
Member of the Bar in all High Courts -and for that matter even the additional 
undertaking that is being obtained in the Bombay High Court if properly read 
will show that it merely creates a binding obligation on the concerned Member 
of the Bar but does not create any obligation or commitment on the part of the 
appointing authority to make the offer of permanent Judgeship to him. It is 
difficult to accept either of these contentions of the learned Attorney General. 
It was not disputed before us that constitutional conventions and practices 
have importance under unwritten as well as written Constitutions and the 
position that conventions have a role to play in interpreting articles of a 
Constitution is clear from several decided cases. In U.N.R. Rao v. Indira 
Gandhi, (1971) 2 SCC 63, Chief Justice Sikri observed thus: (SCC p. 64, para 
3) 
"It was said that we must interpret Article 75(3) according to its own 
terms regardless of the conventions that prevail in the United Kingdom. 
If the words of an Article are clear, notwithstanding any relevant 
convention, effect will no doubt be given to the words. But it must be 
remembered that we are interpreting a Constitution and not an Act of 
Parliament, a Constitution which establishes a Parliamentary system of 
Government with a Cabinet. In trying to understand one may well keep 
in mind the conventions prevalent at the time the Constitution was 
framed." 
In State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 592, also the 
importance of a constitutional convention or practice by way of crystallising 
the otherwise vague and loose content of a power to be found in certain 
article has been emphasised. In the State of W.B. v. Nripendra Nath Bagchi, 

141 


Page 142 

AIR 1966 SC 447, the entire interpretation of the concept of 'vesting of control' 
over District Courts and Courts subordinate thereto in the High Court was 
animated by conventions and practices having regard to the history, object 
and purpose that lay behind the group of relevant articles, the principal 
purpose being, the securing of the independence of the subordinate judiciary. 
It is true that no constitutional convention or practice can affect, alter or 
control the operation of any article if its meaning is quite plain and clear but 
here Article 224(1) merely provides for situations when Additional Judges 
from duly qualified persons could be appointed to a High Court and at the 
highest reading the article with Section 14 of the General Clauses Act it can 
be said that the power conferred by that article may be exercised from time to 
time as occasion requires but on the question as to whether when the 
occasion arises to make appointment on expiry of the term of a sitting 
Additional Judge whether he should be continued or a fresher or outsider 
could be appointed by ignoring the erstwhile incumbent even when arrears 
continue to obtain in that High Court the article is silent and not at all clear and 
hence the principle invoked by the learned Attorney-General will not apply. On 
the other hand, it will be proper to invoke in such a situation the other well-
settled principle that in construing a constitutional provision the implications 
which arise from the structure of the Constitution itself or from its scheme may 
legitimately be made and looking at Article 224(1) from this angle a 
wholesome constitutional convention or practice that has grown because of 
such implications will have to be borne in mind especially when it serves to 
safeguard one of the basic features which is the cardinal faith underlying our 
Constitution, namely, independence of the judiciary. In other words a limitation 
on the otherwise absolute power and discretion contained in Article 224(1) is 
required to be read into it because of the clear implication arising from the 
said cardinal faith which forms a fundamental pillar supporting the basic 
structure of the Constitution, as otherwise the exercise of the power in the 
absolute manner as suggested will be destructive of the same. That it is not 
sound approach to embark upon 'a strict literal reach' of any constitutional 
provision in order to determine its true ambit and effect is strikingly illustrated 
in the case of Article 368 which came up for consideration before this Court in 
Kesavananda Bharati case, (1973) 4 SCC 225, where this Court held that the 
basic or essential features of the Constitution do act as fetters or limitations 
on the otherwise wide amending power contained in that article. In Australia 
limitations on the law-making powers of the Parliament of the Federal 
Commonwealth over the States were read into the concerned provisions of 
the Constitution because of implications arising from the very federal nature of 
the Constitution: (vide Lord Mayor Councillors and Citizens of the City of 
Melbourne v. Commonwealth, 74 Commonwealth LR 31, and the State of 
Victoria v. Commonwealth of Australia, 122 Commonwealth LR 353). As 
regards the undertakings of the types mentioned above, it is true that strictly 
and legally speaking these undertakings only create a binding obligation on 
the concerned Member of the Bar and not on the appointing authority but it 

142 


Page 143 

cannot be forgotten that when such undertakings were thought of, the 
postulate underlying the same was that there was no question of the 
appointing authority not making the offer of permanent Judgeship to the 
concerned Member of the Bar but that such an offer would be made and upon 
the same being made the sitting Additional Judge recruited from the Bar 
should not decline to accept it and revert to the Bar. I am therefore clearly of 
the view that the aforesaid convention or practice and the undertaking serve 
the cause of public interest in two respects as indicated above and those two 
aspects of public interest confer upon these sitting Additional Judges recruited 
from the Bar a legitimate expectancy and the enforceable right not to be 
dropped illegally or at the whim or caprice of the appointing authority but to be 
considered for continuance in that High Court either by way of extending their 
term or making them permanent in preference to freshers or outsiders and it is 
impossible to construe Article 224(1) as conferring upon the appointing 
authority absolute power and complete discretion in the matter of appointment 
of Additional Judges to a High Court as suggested and the suggested 
construction has to be rejected. In view of the above discussion it is clear that 
there is a valid classification between proposed appointees for initial 
recruitment and the sitting Additional Judges whose cases for their 
continuance after the expiry of their initial term are to be decided and the two 
are not in the same position." 

The observations of D.A. Desai, J. are expressed hereunder:-

"696. It may be briefly mentioned here that Writ Petition No. 274 of 1981 
filed in this Court and Transferred Cases Nos. 2, 6 and 24 of 1981 were listed 
to be heard along with the present batch of cases with a view to avoiding the 
repetition of the arguments on points common to both sets of cases. In the 
first group of cases the question of construction of Articles 217, 224 and other 
connected articles prominently figured in the context of circular of the Law 
Minister dated March 18, 1981, seeking consent of Additional Judges for 
being appointed as permanent Judges in other High Courts and the short-
term extensions given to Shri O.N. Vohra, Shri S.N. Kumar and Shri S.B. 
Wad, Additional Judges of Delhi High Court and the final non-appointment of 
Shri O.N. Vohra and Shri S.N. Kumar. The submission was that the circular of 
the Law Minister manifests a covert attempt to transfer Additional Judges from 
one High Court to other High Court without consulting the Chief Justice of 
India as required by Article 222(1) and thereby circumventing the majority 
decision in Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth, (1977) 4 SCC 193. 
The central theme was the scope, ambit and content of consultation which the 
President must have with the three constitutional functionaries set out in 
Article 217(1). In the second group of cases, the question arose in the context 
of transfer of Shri K.B.N. Singh, Chief Justice of Patna High Court as Chief 
Justice of Madras High Court consequent upon the transfer of Shri M.M. 
Ismail, Chief Justice of Madras High Court as Chief Justice of Kerala High 
Court by Presidential Notification dated January 19, 1981, in exercise of the 

143 


Page 144 

power conferred upon him by Article 222. The controversy centred down the 
scope, ambit and content of consultation that the President must have with 
the Chief Justice of India before exercising the power to transfer under Article 
222. Thus, the scope, ambit and content of consultation under Article 217 as 
also one of Article 222 which, as Mr Seervai stated, was more or less the 
same though the different facets on which consultation must be focussed may 
differ in the case of transfer and in the case of appointment, figured 
prominently in both the groups of cases. The parameters of scope, ambit and 
content of consultation both under Articles 217(1), 222 and 224, were drawn 
on a wide canvas to be tested on the touchstone of independence of judiciary 
being the fighting faith and fundamental and basic feature of the Constitution. 
It was stated that if the consultation itself is to provide a reliable safeguard 
against arbitrary and naked exercise of power against judiciary, the procedure 
of consultation must be so extensive as to cover all aspects of the matter and 
it must be made so firm and rigid that any contravention or transgression of it 
would be treated as mala fide or subversive of independence of judiciary and 
the decision can be corrected by judicial review. Therefore, at the outset it is 
necessary to be properly informed as to the concept of independence of 
judiciary as set out in the Constitution. 
697. 
The entire gamut of arguments revolved principally round the 
construction of Articles 217 and 224 in one batch of petitions and Article 222 
in another batch but the canvas was spread wide covering various other 
articles of the Constitution, analogous provisions in previous Government of 
India Acts, similar provisions in other democratic constitutions and reports of 
Law Commission. Rival constructions canvassed centred upon the pivotal 
assumption that independence of judiciary is a basic and fundamental feature 
of the Constitution which has its genesis in the power of judicial review which 
enables the court to declare executive and legislative actions ultra vires the 
Constitution. In this connection we are not starting on a clean slate as the 
contention in this very form and for an avowed object was widely canvassed 
in Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth v. Union of India, (1976) 17 Guj LR 1017 (FB), 
and in Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth (supra). Some additional 
dimensions were added to this basic concept of independence of judiciary 
while both the parties vied with each other as in the past (see statement of 
Shri S.V. Gupte, then Attorney-General in Sheth case (supra), on proclaiming 
their commitment to independence of judiciary though in its scope and content 
and approach there was a marked divergence. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
771. 
Now, power is conferred on the President to make appointment of 
Judge of Supreme Court after consultation with such of the Judges of the 
Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may 
deem necessary. The submission is that the expression 'may deem 
necessary' qualifies the expression 'consultation' and that if he deems 
otherwise the President can proceed to make appointment of the Chief 
Justice of India without consultation with any of the Judges of the Supreme 

144 


Page 145 

Court and of the High Courts. In other words, it was submitted on behalf of the 
respondents, the President has a discretion to consult or not to consult 
Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts before making appointment of 
Chief Justice of India. It was pointed out that where consultation is obligatory 
it is specifically provided and reference was made to the proviso extracted 
hereinabove wherein it is stated that it would be obligatory upon the President 
to consult the Chief Justice of India before making appointment of a Judge of 
the Supreme Court other than the Chief Justice of India. Undoubtedly, the 
proviso leaves no option to the President but to consult the Chief Justice of 
India while making appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court other than 
the Chief Justice of India, but it is rather difficult to accept the construction as 
suggested on behalf of the respondents that in making appointment of the 
Chief Justice of India the President is at large and may not consult any 
functionary in the judicial branch of the State before making appointment of 
Chief Justice of India. The expression 'may deem necessary' qualifies the 
number of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts to be consulted. 
What is optional is selection of number of Judges to be consulted and not the 
consultation because the expression 'shall be appointed after consultation' 
would mandate consultation. An extreme submission that the President may 
consult High Court Judges for appointment of the Chief Justice of India 
omitting altogether Supreme Court Judges does not commend to us, because 
the consultation with 'such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the 
High Courts' would clearly indicate that the consultation has to be with some 
Judges of the Supreme Court and some Judges of the High Courts. The 
conjunction 'and' is clearly indicative of the intendment of the framers of the 
Constitution. If there was disjunctive 'or' between Supreme Court and High 
Courts in sub-article (2) of Article 124 there could have been some force in 
the submission that the President may appoint Chief Justice of India ignoring 
the Supreme Court and after consulting some High Court Judges. 
Undoubtedly, sub-article (2) does not cast an obligation to consult all Judges 
of the Supreme Court and all Judges of the High Courts but in practical 
working the President in order to discharge his function of selecting the best 
suitable person to be the Chief Justice of India must choose such fair 
sprinkling of Supreme Court and High Court Judges as would enable him to 
gather enough and relevant material which would help him in decision-making 
process. Mr Seervai submitted that this Court must avoid such construction of 
Article 124 which would enable the President to appoint Chief Justice of India 
without consultation with any judicial functionaries. That is certainly correct. 
But then he proceeded to suggest a construction where, by a constitutional 
convention, any necessity of consultation would be obviated and yet the 
executive power to be choosy and selective in appointment of Chief Justice of 
India can be controlled or thwarted. He said that a constitutional convention 
must be read that the seniormost amongst the puisne Judges of the Supreme 
Court should as a rule be appointed as Chief Justice of India except when he 
is physically unfit to shoulder the responsibilities. This constitutional 

145 


Page 146 

convention, it was said, when read in Article 124(2) would obviate any 
necessity of consultation with any functionary in the judicial branch before 
making appointment of Chief Justice of India and yet would so circumscribe 
the power of the President as not to enable the executive to choose a person 
of its bend and thinking. In this very context it was pointed out that Article 126 
permits the President to appoint even the juniormost Judge of the Supreme 
Court to be an acting Chief Justice of India and it was said that such an 
approach or such construction of Article 126 would be subversive of the 
independence of judiciary. It was said that if the juniormost can be appointed 
acting Chief Justice of India, every Judge in order to curry favour would 
decide in favour of executive. And as far as Article 124 is concerned it was 
said that if the convention of seniority is not read in Article 124(2), every 
Judge of the Supreme Court would be a possible candidate for the office of 
Chief Justice of India and on account of personal bias would be disqualified 
from being consulted. There is no warrant for such an extreme position and 
the reflection on the Judges of the Supreme Court is equally unwarranted. On 
the construction as indicated above there will be positive limitation on the 
power of the President while making appointment of Chief Justice of India and 
it is not necessary to read any limitation on the power of the President under 
Article 126 while making appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court as 
acting Chief Justice of India. But the observation is incidental to the 
submission and may be examined in an appropriate case. And the question of 
construction is kept open. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
775. 
It was also stated that the expression 'obtain' in the circular has the 
element of coercion and a consent ceases to be consent if it is obtained under 
coercion. It was said that consent and coercion go ill together because forced 
assent would not be consent in the eye of law. It was said that the threat 
implicit in the circular becomes evident because the Chief Minister, the strong 
arm of the executive is being asked to obtain consent. If every little thing is 
looked upon with suspicion and as an attack on the independence of judiciary, 
it becomes absolutely misleading. Law Minister, if he writes directly to the 
Chief Justice or the Judge concerned, propriety of the action may be open to 
question. Chandrachud, J., has warned in Sheth case (supra) that the 
executive cannot and ought not to establish rapport with Judges (SCR p. 456 
CD : SCC p. 230, para 43). Taking this direction in its letter and spirit, the Law 
Minister wrote to the Chief Ministers. The Chief Minister in turn was bound to 
approach the Chief Justice. This is also known to be a proper communication 
channel with Judges of High Court. In this context the expression 'obtain' 
would only mean request the Judge to give consent if he so desires. If he 
gives the consent, well and good, and if does not give, no evil consequences 
are likely to ensue. I am not impressed by the submission of the learned 
Attorney-General that one who gives consent may have some advantage over 
the one who does not. I do not see any remote advantage and if any such 
advantage is given and if charge of victimisation is made out by the Judge not 

146

giving consent, the arm of judicial review is strong enough to rectify the 
executive error.

The public interest like public policy is an unruly horse and is 
incapable of any precise definition and, therefore, it was urged that this 
safeguard is very vague and of doubtful utility. It was urged that these 
safeguards failed to checkmate the arbitrary exercise of power in 1976. This 
approach overlooks the fact that the Lakshman Rekha drawn by the 
safeguards when transgressed or crossed, the judicial review will set at 
naught the mischief. True it is that it is almost next to impossible for individual 
Judge of a High Court to knock at the doors of the Courts because access to 
justice is via the insurmountable mountain of costs and expenses. This need 
not detain us because we have seen that in time of crisis the Bar has risen to 
the occasion twice over in near past though it must be conceded that judicial 
review is increasingly becoming the preserve of the high, mighty and the 
affluent. But the three safeguards, namely, full and effective consultation with 
the Chief Justice of India, and that the power to transfer can be exercised in 
public interest, and judicial review, would certainly insulate independence of 
judiciary against an attempt by the executive to control it." 

Last of all, reference may be made to the observations of E.S. Venkataramiah, 

J., (as he then was) who held as under:-

"1245. The question of policy is a matter entirely for the President to decide. 
Even though the Chief Justice of India is consulted in that behalf by the 
President since the policy relates to the High Courts, his opinion is not binding 
on the President. It is open to the President to adopt any policy which is 
subject only to the judicial review by the Court. Under Article 222 of the 
Constitution the Chief Justice of India has to be consulted on the question 
whether a particular Judge should be transferred and where he should be 
transferred while implementing the said policy. If the Government requests the 
Chief Justice of India to give his opinion on a transfer to implement the said 
policy which is really in the public interest he cannot decline to do so. Even 
though the Chief Justice was opposed to the 'wholesale transfers' of Judges 
there is no bar for the Government treating the recommendation for transfers 
made by the Chief Justice of India as a part of the implementation of its 
policy. That the transfer of Shri K.B.N. Singh was on account of the policy of 
the Government can be gathered from the following statements in the 
affidavits filed before this Court: In para 8 of the affidavit dated September 16, 
1981 of Shri K.B.N. Singh it is stated: "When the deponent wanted to know 
why he might be transferred to Madras, the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India 
merely said that it was the Government policy, but gave no clue as to what 
necessitated his transfer from Patna to Madras." In para 2(g) of the affidavit of 
the Chief Justice of India he has stated: "I deny that when Shri K.B.N. Singh 

147 


Page 148 

wanted to know over the telephone on January 5, 1981, I stated merely that it 
was the 'Government policy'....". In paragraph 8 of the rejoinder-affidavit 
dated October 16, 1981 of Shri K.B.N. Singh, it is stated "at one point he also 
said that it was Government policy to effect transfer in batches of two or 
three". 

59. The sequence of judgments would now lead us to the judgment of this 

Court in S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India, (1987) 1 SCC 124. The view 

expressed by a bench of 5 Hon'ble Judges of this Court in the above case, was 

in respect of a controversy quite similar to the one in hand. In the instant 

judgment, the constitutional vires of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 was 

under challenge. The above Act was framed under Article 323A of the 

Constitution. Article 323A was introduced in the Constitution by the Constitution 

(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The main judgment was delivered by 

Ranganath Misra, J. (as he then was) on behalf of himself and V. Khalid, G.L. 

Oza and M.M. Dutt, JJ. Insofar as the concurring view rendered by P.N. 

Bhagwati, CJ is concerned, the conclusion recorded in the following paragraphs 

has a bearing on the present controversy. 

"3. 
It is now well settled as a result of the decision of this Court in Minerva 
Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, (1980) 3 SCC 625, that judicial review is a basic 
and essential feature of the Constitution and no law passed by Parliament in 
exercise of its constituent power can abrogate it or take it away. If the power 
of judicial review is abrogated or taken away the Constitution will cease to be 
what it is. It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional scheme that every 
organ of the State, every authority under the Constitution, derives its power 
from the Constitution and has to act within the limits of such power. It is a 
limited government which we have under the Constitution and both the 
executive and the legislature have to act within the limits of the power 
conferred upon them under the Constitution. Now a question may arise as to 
what are the powers of the executive and whether the executive has acted 
within the scope of its power. Such a question obviously cannot be left to the 
executive to decide and for two very good reasons. First the decision of the 
question would depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution and the 

148 


Page 149 

laws and this would pre-eminently be a matter fit to be decided by the 
judiciary, because it is the judiciary which alone would be possessed of 
expertise in this field and secondly, the constitutional and legal protection 
afforded to the citizen would become illusory, if it were left to the executive to 
determine the legality of its own action. So also if the legislature makes a law 
and a dispute arises whether in making the law, the legislature has acted 
outside the area of its legislative competence or the law is violative of the 
fundamental rights or of any other provisions of the Constitution, its resolution 
cannot, for the same reasons, be left to the determination of the legislature. 
The Constitution has, therefore created an independent machinery for 
resolving these disputes and this independent machinery is the judiciary 
which is vested with the power of judicial review to determine the legality of 
executive action and the validity of legislation passed by the legislature. The 
judiciary is constituted the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to it is 
assigned the delicate task of determining what is the extent and scope of the 
power conferred on each branch of government, what are the limits on the 
exercise of such power under the Constitution and whether any action of any 
branch transgresses such limits. It is also a basic principle of the rule of law 
which permeates every provision of the Constitution and which forms its very 
core and essence that the exercise of power by the executive or any other 
authority must not only be conditioned by the Constitution but also be in 
accordance with law and it is the judiciary which has to ensure that the law is 
observed and there is compliance with the requirements of law on the part of 
the executive and other authorities. This function is discharged by the 
judiciary by exercise of the power of judicial review which is a most potent 
weapon in the hands of the judiciary for maintenance of the Rule of Law. The 
power of judicial review is an integral part of our constitutional system and 
without it, there will be no government of laws and the Rule of Law would 
become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. That is why I observed 
in my judgment in Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra) at p. 287 and 288: (SCC p. 
678, para 87) 
"I am of the view that if there is one feature of our Constitution which, 
more than any other, is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of 
democracy and the rule of law, it is the power of judicial review and it is 
unquestionably, to my mind, part of the basic structure of the 
Constitution. Of course, when I say this I should not be taken to 
suggest that effective alternative institutional mechanisms or 
arrangements for judicial review cannot be made by Parliament. But 
what I wish to emphasise is that judicial review is a vital principle of our 
Constitution and it cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic 
structure of the Constitution. If by a constitutional amendment, the 
power of judicial review is taken away and it is provided that the validity 
of any law made by the legislature shall not be liable to be called in 
question on any ground, even if it is outside the legislative competence 
of the legislature or is violative of any fundamental rights, it would be 

149 


Page 150 

nothing short of subversion of the Constitution, for it would make a 
mockery of the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and 
the States and render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile. So 
also if a constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of 
taking away the power of judicial review and providing that no 
amendment made in the Constitution shall be liable to be questioned on 
any ground, even if such amendment is violative of the basic structure 
and, therefore, outside the amendatory power of Parliament, it would be 
making Parliament sole judge of the constitutional validity of what it has 
done and that would, in effect and substance, nullify the limitation on 
the amending power of Parliament and affect the basic structure of the 
Constitution. The conclusion must therefore inevitably follow that clause 
(4) of the Article 368 is unconstitutional and void as damaging the basic 
structure of the Constitution." 
It is undoubtedly true that my judgment in Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra) was 
a minority judgment but so far as this aspect is concerned, the majority 
Judges also took the same view and held that judicial review is a basic and 
essential feature of the Constitution and it cannot be abrogated without 
affecting the basic structure of the Constitution and it is equally clear from the 
same decision that though judicial review cannot be altogether abrogated by 
Parliament by amending the Constitution in exercise of its constituent power, 
Parliament can certainly, without in any way violating the basic structure 
doctrine, set up effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements 
for judicial review. The basic and essential feature of judicial review cannot be 
dispensed with but it would be within the competence of Parliament to amend 
the Constitution so as to substitute in place of the High Court, another 
alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement for judicial review, 
provided it is no less efficacious than the High Court. Then, instead of the 
High Court, it would be another institutional mechanism or authority which 
would be exercising the power of judicial review with a view to enforcing the 
constitutional limitations and maintaining the rule of law. Therefore, if any 
constitutional amendment made by Parliament takes away from the High 
Court the power of judicial review in any particular area and vests it in any 
other institutional mechanism or authority, it would not be violative of the basic 
structure doctrine, so long as the essential condition is fulfilled, namely, that 
the alternative institutional mechanism or authority set up by the parliamentary 
amendment is no less effective than the High Court. 
4. 
Here, in the present case, the impugned Act has been enacted by 
Parliament in exercise of the power conferred by clause (1) of Article 323-A 
which was introduced in the Constitution by Constitution (42nd Amendment) 
Act, 1976. Clause (2)(d) of this article provides that a law made by Parliament 
under clause (1) may exclude the jurisdiction of courts, except the jurisdiction 
of the Supreme Court under Article 136, with respect to the disputes or 
complaints referred to in clause (1). The exclusion of the jurisdiction of the 
High Court under Articles 226 and 227 by any law made by Parliament under 

150 


Page 151 

clause (1) of Article 323-A is, therefore, specifically authorised by the 
constitutional amendment enacted in clause (2)(d) of that article. It is clear 
from the discussion in the preceding para that this constitutional amendment 
authorising exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 
and 227 postulates for its validity that the law made under clause (1) of Article 
323-A excluding the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 
must provide for an effective alternative institutional mechanism or authority 
for judicial review. If this constitutional amendment were to permit a law made 
under clause (1) of Article 323-A to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court 
under Articles 226 and 227 without setting up an effective alternative 
institutional mechanism or arrangement for judicial review, it would be 
violative of the basic structure doctrine and hence outside the constituent 
power of Parliament. It must, therefore, be read as implicit in this 
constitutional amendment that the law excluding the jurisdiction of the High 
Court under Articles 226 and 227 permissible under it must not leave a void 
but it must set up another effective institutional mechanism or authority and 
vest the power of judicial review in it. Consequently, the impugned Act 
excluding the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 in 
respect of service matters and vesting such jurisdiction in the Administrative 
Tribunal can pass the test of constitutionality as being within the ambit and 
coverage of clause (2)(d) of Article 323-A, only if it can be shown that the 
Administrative Tribunal set up under the impugned Act is equally efficacious 
as the High Court, so far as the power of judicial review over service matters 
is concerned. We must, therefore, address ourselves to the question whether 
the Administrative Tribunal established under the impugned Act can be 
regarded as equally effective and efficacious in exercising the power of 
judicial review as the High Court acting under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution." 

Extracts from the judgment rendered by Ranganath Misra, J. (as he then was) 

are first of all being reproduced hereunder:-

"10. 
In the writ applications as presented, the main challenge was to the 
abolition of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 in respect of specified 
service disputes. Challenge was also raised against the taking away of the 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227. It was further 
canvassed that establishment of Benches of the Tribunal at Allahabad, 
Bangalore, Bombay, Calcutta, Gauhati, Madras and Nagpur with the principal 
seat at Delhi would still prejudice the parties whose cases were already 
pending before the respective High Courts located at places other than these 
places and unless at the seat of every High Court facilities for presentation of 
applications and for hearing thereof were provided the parties and their 
lawyers would be adversely affected. The interim order made on October 31, 
1985, made provision to meet the working difficulties. Learned Attorney-

151 


Page 152 

General on behalf of the Central Government assured the court that early 
steps would be taken to amend the law so as to save the jurisdiction under 
Article 32, remove other minor anomalies and set up a Bench of the Tribunal 
at the seat of every High Court. By the Administrative Tribunals (Amendment) 
Ordinance, 1986, these amendments were brought about and by now an 
appropriate Act of Parliament has replaced the Ordinance. Most of the original 
grounds of attack thus do not survive and the contentions that were 
canvassed at the hearing by the counsel appearing for different parties are 
these: 
(1) 
Judicial review is a fundamental aspect of the basic structure of our 
Constitution and bar of the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 
and 227 as contained in Section 28 of the Act cannot be sustained; 
(2) Even if the bar of jurisdiction is upheld, the Tribunal being a 
substitute of the High Court, its constitution and set up should be such that 
it would in fact function as such substitute and become an institution in 
which the parties could repose faith and trust; 
(3) 
Benches of the Tribunal should not only be established at the seat of 
every High Court but should be available at every place where the High 
Courts have permanent Benches; 
(4) 
So far as Tribunals set up or to be set up by the Central or the State 
Governments are concerned, they should have no jurisdiction in respect of 
employees of the Supreme Court or members of the subordinate judiciary 
and employees working in such establishments inasmuch as exercise of 
jurisdiction of the Tribunal would interfere with the control absolutely 
vested in the respective High Courts in regard to the judicial and other 
subordinate officers under Article 235 of the Constitution. 
11. 
After oral arguments were over, learned Attorney-General, after 
obtaining instructions from the Central Government filed a memorandum to 
the effect that Section 2(q) of the Act would be suitably amended so as to 
exclude officers and servants in the employment of the Supreme Court and 
members and staff of the subordinate judiciary from the purview of the Act. In 
the same memorandum it has also been said that Government would arrange 
for sittings of the Benches of the Tribunal at the seat or seats of each High 
Court on the basis that 'sittings' will include 'circuit sittings' and the details 
thereof would be worked out by the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman 
concerned. 
12. 
With these concessions made by the learned Attorney-General, only 
two aspects remain to be dealt with by us, namely, those covered by the first 
and the second contentions. 
13. 
Strong reliance was placed on the judgment of Bhagwati, J. (one of us 
-presently the learned Chief Justice) in Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, 
(1980) 3 SCC 625, where it was said: (SCC p. 678, para 87) 
"The power of judicial review is an integral part of our constitutional 
system and without it, there will be no government of laws and the rule 
of law would become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. I am 

152 


Page 153 

of the view that if there is one feature of our Constitution which, more 
than any other, is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of 
democracy and the rule of law, it is the power of judicial review and it is 
unquestionably, to my mind, part of the basic structure of the 
Constitution. Of course, when I say this I should not be taken to suggest 
that effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements for 
judicial review cannot be made by Parliament. But what I wish to 
emphasise is that judicial review is a vital principle of our Constitution 
and it cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic structure of the 
Constitution. If by a constitutional amendment, the power of judicial 
review is taken away and it is provided that the validity of any law made 
by the legislature shall not be liable to be called in question on any 
ground, even if it is outside the legislative competence of the legislature 
or is violative of any fundamental rights, it would be nothing short of 
subversion of the Constitution, for it would make a mockery of the 
distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and 
render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile. So also if a 
constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of taking away 
the power of judicial review…" 
14. 
Article 32 was described by Dr Ambedkar in course of the debate in 
the Constituent Assembly as the 'soul' and 'heart' of the Constitution and it is 
in recognition of this position that though Article 323-A(2)(d) authorised 
exclusion of jurisdiction under Article 32 and the original Act had in Section 28 
provided for it, by amendment jurisdiction under Article 32 has been left 
untouched. The Act thus saves jurisdiction of this Court both under Article 32 
in respect of original proceedings as also under Article 136 for entertaining 
appeals against decisions of the Tribunal on grant of special leave. Judicial 
review by the Apex Court has thus been left intact. 
15. 
The question that arises, however, for consideration is whether bar of 
jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 affects the provision for judicial review. 
The right to move the High Court in its writ jurisdiction -unlike the one under 
Article 32 -is not a fundamental right. Yet, the High Courts, as the working 
experience of three-and-a-half decades shows have in exercise of the power 
of judicial review played a definite and positive role in the matter of 
preservation of fundamental and other rights and in keeping administrative 
action under reasonable control. In these thirty-six years following the 
enforcement of the Constitution, not only has India's population been more 
than doubled but also the number of litigations before the courts including the 
High Courts has greatly increased. As the pendency in the High Courts 
increased and soon became the pressing problem of backlog, the nation's 
attention came to be bestowed on this aspect. Ways and means to relieve the 
High Courts of the load began to engage the attention of the government at 
the Centre as also in the various States. As early as 1969, a Committee was 
set up by the Central Government under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Shah 
of this Court to make recommendations suggesting ways and means for 

153 


Page 154 

effective, expeditious and satisfactory disposal of matters relating to service 
disputes of government servants as it was found that a sizeable portion of 
pending litigations related to this category. The Committee recommended the 
setting up of an independent Tribunal to handle the pending cases before this 
Court and the High Courts. While this report was still engaging the attention of 
government, the Administrative Reforms Commission also took note of the 
situation and recommended the setting up of Civil Services Tribunals to deal 
with appeals of Government servants against disciplinary action. In certain 
States, Tribunals of this type came into existence and started functioning. But 
the Central Government looked into the matter further as it transpired that the 
major chunk of service litigations related to matters other than disciplinary 
action. In May 1976, a Conference of Chief Secretaries of the States 
discussed this problem. Then came the Forty-second Amendment of the 
Constitution bringing in Article 323-A which authorized Parliament to provide 
by law "for the adjudication or trial by Administrative Tribunals of disputes and 
complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons 
appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the 
Union or of any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of 
India or under the control of the Government of India or of any Corporation 
owned or controlled by the government". As already stated this article 
envisaged exclusion of the jurisdiction of all courts, except the jurisdiction of 
the Supreme Court under Article 136, with respect to the disputes or 
complaints referred to in clause (1). Though the Constitution now contained 
the enabling power, no immediate steps were taken to set up any Tribunal as 
contemplated by Article 323-A. A Constitution Bench of this Court in K.K. 
Dutta v. Union of India, (1980) 4 SCC 38, observed: [SCC p. 39, para 1 : SCC 
(L & S) p. 486] 
"There are few other litigative areas than disputes between members of 
various services inter se, where the principle that public policy requires 
that all litigation must have an end can apply with greater force. Public 
servants ought not to be driven or required to dissipate their time and 
energy in courtroom battles. Thereby their attention is diverted from 
public to private affairs and their inter se disputes affect their sense of 
oneness without which no institution can function effectively. The 
constitution of Service Tribunals by State Governments with an apex 
Tribunal at the Centre, which, in the generality of cases, should be the 
final arbiter of controversies relating to conditions of service, including 
the vexed question of seniority, may save the courts from the avalanche 
of writ petitions and appeals in service matters. The proceedings of 
such Tribunals can have the merit of informality and if they will not be 
tied down to strict rules of evidence, they might be able to produce 
solutions which will satisfy many…" 
In the meantime the problem of the backlog of cases in the High Courts 
became more acute and pressing and came to be further discussed in 
Parliament and in conferences and seminars. Ultimately in January 1985, 

154 


Page 155 

both Houses of Parliament passed the Bill and with the Presidential assent on 
February 27, 1985, the law enabling the long awaited Tribunal to be 
constituted came into existence. As already noticed, the Central Government 
notified the Act to come into force with effect from November 1, 1985. 
16. 
Exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Courts in service matters 
and its propriety as also validity have thus to be examined in the background 
indicated above. We have already seen that judicial review by this Court is 
left wholly unaffected and thus there is a forum where matters of importance 
and grave injustice can be brought for determination or rectification. Thus 
exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Court does not totally bar judicial 
review. This Court in Minerva Mills' case (supra) did point out that "effective 
alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements for judicial review" can 
be made by Parliament. Thus it is possible to set up an alternative institution 
in place of the High Court for providing judicial review. The debates and 
deliberations spread over almost two decades for exploring ways and 
means for relieving the High Courts of the load of backlog of cases and for 
assuring quick settlement of service disputes in the interest of the public 
servants as also the country cannot be lost sight of while considering this 
aspect. It has not been disputed before us -and perhaps could not have 
been -that the Tribunal under the scheme of the Act would take over a part 
of the existing backlog and a share of the normal load of the High Courts. 
The Tribunal has been contemplated as a substitute and not as 
supplemental to the High Court in the scheme of administration of justice. To 
provide the Tribunal as an additional forum from where parties could go to 
the High Court would certainly have been a retrograde step considering the 
situation and circumstances to meet which the innovation has been brought 
about. Thus barring of the jurisdiction of the High Court can indeed not be a 
valid ground of attack. 
17. 
What, however, has to be kept in view is that the Tribunal should 
be a real substitute of the High Court -not only in form and de jure but in 
content and de facto . As was pointed out in Minerva's Mills case (supra), the 
alternative arrangement has to be effective and efficient as also capable of 
upholding the constitutional limitations. Article 16 of the Constitution 
guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. 
Article 15 bars discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or 
place of birth. The touch-stone of equality enshrined in Article 14 is the 
greatest of guarantees for the citizen. Centering around these articles in the 
Constitution a service jurisprudence has already grown in this country. 
Under Sections 14 and 15 of the Act all the powers of the Courts except 
those of this Court in regard to matters specified therein vest in the Tribunal 
--either Central or State. Thus the Tribunal is the substitute of the High 
Court and is entitled to exercise the powers thereof. 
18. 
The High Courts have been functioning over a century and a 
quarter and until the Federal Court was established under the Government 
of India Act, 1935, used to be the highest courts within their respective 

155 


Page 156 

jurisdictions subject to an appeal to the Privy Council in a limited category of 
cases. In this long period of about six scores of years, the High Courts have 
played their role effectively, efficiently as also satisfactorily. The litigant in 
this country has seasoned himself to look upto the High Court as the 
unfailing protector of his person, property and honour. The institution has 
served its purpose very well and the common man has thus come to repose 
great confidence therein. Disciplined, independent and trained Judges well 
versed in law and working with all openness in an unattached and objective 
manner have ensured dispensation of justice over the years. Aggrieved 
people approach the Court -the social mechanism to act as the arbiter -
not under legal obligation but under the belief and faith that justice shall be 
done to them and the State's authorities would implement the decision of the 
Court. It is, therefore, of paramount importance that the substitute institution 
-the Tribunal -must be a worthy successor of the High Court in all 
respects. That is exactly what this Court intended to convey when it spoke of 
an alternative mechanism in Minerva Mills' case (supra)." 

60. Reference may also be made to the decision rendered by this Court in L. 

Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261. The instant decision was 

rendered by a constitution bench of 7 Judges. The question which arose for 

determination in the instant judgment was, whether the power conferred upon the 

Parliament and the State legislatures vide Articles 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d) 

totally excluding the jurisdiction of "all courts" except the Supreme Court, under 

Article 136 of the Constitution, violated the "basic structure" of the Constitution. 

In other words, the question was, whether annulling/retracting the power of 

"judicial review" conferred on High Courts (under Articles 226 and 227 of the 

Constitution) and on the Supreme Court (under Articles 32 of the Constitution), 

was violative of the "basic structure" of the Constitution. Furthermore, whether 

the tribunals constituted under Articles 323A and 323B of the Constitution, 

possess the competence to test the constitutional validity of statutory 

provisions/rules? And also, whether Tribunals constituted under Articles 323A 

156 


Page 157 

and 323B of the Constitution could be said to be effective substitutes of the 

jurisdiction vested in the High Courts? And if not, what changes were required? 

The above controversy came to be referred to the constitution bench in 

furtherance of an order passed in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1995) 1 

SCC 400, on account of the decisions rendered in post S.P. Sampath Kumar 

cases (supra), namely, J.B. Chopra v. Union of India, (1987) 1 SCC 422, M.B. 

Majumdar v. Union of India, (1990) 4 SCC 501, Amulya Chandra Kalita v. Union 

of India, (1991) 1 SCC 181, R.K. Jain v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 119, and 

Dr. Mahabal Ram v. Indian Council of Agricultural Research, (1994) 2 SCC 410. 

On the issues which are relevant to the present controversy, this Court observed 

as under:-

"76. To express our opinion on the issue whether the power of judicial 
review vested in the High Courts and in the Supreme Court under Articles 
226/227 and 32 is part of the basic structure of the Constitution, we must 
first attempt to understand what constitutes the basic structure of the 
Constitution. The doctrine of basic structure was evolved in Kesavananda 
Bharati case,(1973) 4 SCC 225. However, as already mentioned, that case 
did not lay down that the specific and particular features mentioned in that 
judgment alone would constitute the basic structure of our Constitution. 
Indeed, in the judgments of Shelat and Grover, JJ., Hegde and Mukherjea, 
JJ. and Jaganmohan Reddy, J., there are specific observations to the 
effect that their list of essential features comprising the basic structure of 
the Constitution are illustrative and are not intended to be exhaustive. In 
Indira Gandhi case, 1975 Supp. SCC 1, Chandrachud, J. held that the 
proper approach for a Judge who is confronted with the question whether a 
particular facet of the Constitution is part of the basic structure, is to 
examine, in each individual case, the place of the particular feature in the 
scheme of our Constitution, its object and purpose, and the consequences 
of its denial on the integrity of our Constitution as a fundamental instrument 
for the governance of the country. (supra at pp. 751-752). This approach 
was specifically adopted by Bhagwati, J. in Minerva Mills case, (1980) 3 
SCC 625, (at pp. 671-672) and is not regarded as the definitive test in this 
field of Constitutional Law.

77. We find that the various factors mentioned in the test evolved by 
Chandrachud, J. have already been considered by decisions of various 
Benches of this Court that have been referred to in the course of our 
analysis. From their conclusions, many of which have been extracted by us 
in toto, it appears that this Court has always considered the power of 
judicial review vested in the High Courts and in this Court under Articles 
226 and 32 respectively, enabling legislative action to be subjected to the 
scrutiny of superior courts, to be integral to our constitutional scheme. 
While several judgments have made specific references to this aspect 
[Gajendragadkar, C.J. in Keshav Singh case, AIR 1965 SC 745, Beg, J. 
and Khanna, J. in Kesavananda Bharati case (supra), Chandrachud, C.J. 
and Bhagwati, J. in Minerva Mills (supra), Chandrachud, C.J. in Fertilizer 
Kamgar, (1981) 1 SCC 568, K.N. Singh, J. in Delhi Judicial Service Assn., 
(1991) 4 SCC 406] the rest have made general observations highlighting 
the significance of this feature. 
78. The legitimacy of the power of courts within constitutional 
democracies to review legislative action has been questioned since the 
time it was first conceived. The Constitution of India, being alive to such 
criticism, has, while conferring such power upon the higher judiciary, 
incorporated important safeguards. An analysis of the manner in which the 
Framers of our Constitution incorporated provisions relating to the judiciary 
would indicate that they were very greatly concerned with securing the 
independence of the judiciary. These attempts were directed at ensuring 
that the judiciary would be capable of effectively discharging its wide 
powers of judicial review. While the Constitution confers the power to strike 
down laws upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court, it also contains 
elaborate provisions dealing with the tenure, salaries, allowances, 
retirement age of Judges as well as the mechanism for selecting Judges to 
the superior courts. The inclusion of such elaborate provisions appears to 
have been occasioned by the belief that, armed by such provisions, the 
superior courts would be insulated from any executive or legislative 
attempts to interfere with the making of their decisions. The Judges of the 
superior courts have been entrusted with the task of upholding the 
Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power to interpret it. 
It is they who have to ensure that the balance of power envisaged by the 
Constitution is maintained and that the legislature and the executive do 
not, in the discharge of their functions, transgress constitutional limitations. 
It is equally their duty to oversee that the judicial decisions rendered by 
those who man the subordinate courts and tribunals do not fall foul of strict 
standards of legal correctness and judicial independence. The 
constitutional safeguards which ensure the independence of the Judges of 
the superior judiciary, are not available to the Judges of the subordinate 
judiciary or to those who man tribunals created by ordinary legislations. 
Consequently, Judges of the latter category can never be considered full 
and effective substitutes for the superior judiciary in discharging the 

158 


Page 159 

function of constitutional interpretation. We, therefore, hold that the power 
of judicial review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under 
Article 226 and in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is an 
integral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its 
basic structure. Ordinarily, therefore, the power of High Courts and the 
Supreme Court to test the constitutional validity of legislations can never 
be ousted or excluded. 
79. We also hold that the power vested in the High Courts to exercise 
judicial superintendence over the decisions of all courts and tribunals 
within their respective jurisdictions is also part of the basic structure of the 
Constitution. This is because a situation where the High Courts are 
divested of all other judicial functions apart from that of constitutional 
interpretation, is equally to be avoided.

96. It has been brought to our notice that one reason why these 
Tribunals have been functioning inefficiently is because there is no 
authority charged with supervising and fulfilling their administrative 
requirements. To this end, it is suggested that the Tribunals be made 
subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Courts within whose 
territorial jurisdiction they fall. We are, however, of the view that this may 
not be the best way of solving the problem. We do not think that our 
constitutional scheme requires that all adjudicatory bodies which fall within 
the territorial jurisdiction of the High Courts should be subject to their 
supervisory jurisdiction. If the idea is to divest the High Courts of their 
onerous burdens, then adding to their supervisory functions cannot, in any 
manner, be of assistance to them. The situation at present is that different 
Tribunals constituted under different enactments are administered by 
different administrative departments of the Central and the State 
Governments. The problem is compounded by the fact that some Tribunals 
have been created pursuant to Central Legislations and some others have 
been created by State Legislations. However, even in the case of Tribunals 
created by parliamentary legislations, there is no uniformity in 
administration. We are of the view that, until a wholly independent agency 
for the administration of all such Tribunals can be set up, it is desirable that 
all such Tribunals should be, as far as possible, under a single nodal 
ministry which will be in a position to oversee the working of these 
Tribunals. For a number of reasons that Ministry should appropriately be 
the Ministry of Law. It would be open for the Ministry, in its turn, to appoint 
an independent supervisory body to oversee the working of the Tribunals. 
This will ensure that if the President or Chairperson of the Tribunal is for 
some reason unable to take sufficient interest in the working of the 
Tribunal, the entire system will not languish and the ultimate consumer of 
justice will not suffer. The creation of a single umbrella organisation will, in 
our view, remove many of the ills of the present system. If the need arises, 
there can be separate umbrella organisations at the Central and the State 

159 


Page 160 

levels. Such a supervisory authority must try to ensure that the 
independence of the members of all such Tribunals is maintained. To that 
extent, the procedure for the selection of the members of the Tribunals, the 
manner in which funds are allocated for the functioning of the Tribunals 
and all other consequential details will have to be clearly spelt out. 
97. The suggestions that we have made in respect of appointments to 
Tribunals and the supervision of their administrative function need to be 
considered in detail by those entrusted with the duty of formulating the 
policy in this respect. That body will also have to take into consideration 
the comments of expert bodies like the LCI and the Malimath Committee in 
this regard. We, therefore, recommend that the Union of India initiate 
action in this behalf and after consulting all concerned, place all these 
Tribunals under one single nodal department, preferably the Legal 
Department. 
98. Since we have analysed the issue of the constitutional validity of 
Section 5(6) of the Act at length, we may now pronounce our opinion on 
this aspect. Though the vires of the provision was not in question in Dr 
Mahabal Ram case, (1994) 2 SCC 401, we believe that the approach 
adopted in that case, the relevant portion of which has been extracted in 
the first part of this judgment, is correct since it harmoniously resolves the 
manner in which Sections 5(2) and 5(6) can operate together. We wish to 
make it clear that where a question involving the interpretation of a 
statutory provision or rule in relation to the Constitution arises for the 
consideration of a Single Member Bench of the Administrative Tribunal, the 
proviso to Section 5(6) will automatically apply and the Chairman or the 
Member concerned shall refer the matter to a Bench consisting of at least 
two Members, one of whom must be a Judicial Member. This will ensure 
that questions involving the vires of a statutory provision or rule will never 
arise for adjudication before a Single Member Bench or a Bench which 
does not consist of a Judicial Member. So construed, Section 5(6) will no 
longer be susceptible to charges of unconstitutionality. 
99. 
In view of the reasoning adopted by us, we hold that clause 2( d ) of 
Article 323-A and clause 3( d ) of Article 323-B, to the extent they exclude 
the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles 
226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, are unconstitutional. Section 28 of the 
Act and the "exclusion of jurisdiction" clauses in all other legislations 
enacted under the aegis of Articles 323-A and 323-B would, to the same 
extent, be unconstitutional. The jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts 
under Articles 226/227 and upon the Supreme Court under Article 32 of 
the Constitution is a part of the inviolable basic structure of our 
Constitution. While this jurisdiction cannot be ousted, other courts and 
Tribunals may perform a supplemental role in discharging the powers 
conferred by Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution. The Tribunals 
created under Article 323-A and Article 323-B of the Constitution are 
possessed of the competence to test the constitutional validity of statutory 

160 


Page 161 

provisions and rules. All decisions of these Tribunals will, however, be 
subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the High Court within whose 
jurisdiction the Tribunal concerned falls. The Tribunals will, nevertheless, 
continue to act like courts of first instance in respect of the areas of law for 
which they have been constituted. It will not, therefore, be open for litigants 
to directly approach the High Courts even in cases where they question 
the vires of statutory legislations (except where the legislation which 
creates the particular Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction 
of the Tribunal concerned. Section 5(6) of the Act is valid and constitutional 
and is to be interpreted in the manner we have indicated." 

61. Reference was then made to Union of India v. Madras Bar Association, 

(2010) 11 SCC 1. The instant decision was rendered by a constitution bench of 

5 Judges. The controversy adjudicated upon in this case related to a challenge 

to the constitutional validity of Parts 1B and 1C of the Companies Act, 1956. 

These parts were inserted into the Companies Act, by the Companies (Second 

Amendment) Act, 2002. Thereby, provision was made for the constitution of the 

National Company Law Tribunal and the National Company Law Appellate 

Tribunal. The relevant questions raised in the present controversy, are being 

noticed. Firstly, whether Parliament does not have the jurisdiction/legislative 

competence, to vest intrinsic judicial functions, that have been traditionally 

performed by High Courts, in any tribunal outside the judiciary? Secondly, 

whether transferring of the entire company law jurisdiction, hitherto before vested 

in High Courts, to the National Company Law Tribunal, which was not under the 

control of the judiciary, was violative of the principles of "separation of powers" 

and "independence of judiciary"? Thirdly, whether Sections 10-FB, 10-FD, 10-

FE, 10-FF, 10-FL(2), 10-FO, 10-FR(3), 10-FT, 10-FX contained in Parts I-B and 

I-C of the Companies Act, by virtue of the above amendment, were 

unconstitutional being in breach of the principles of the "rule of law", "separation 

161 


Page 162 

of powers" and "independence of judiciary"? The relevant narration and 

conclusions recorded by this Court are being reproduced hereunder:-

"Section 10-FD(3)(f): Appointment of Technical Member to NCLT 
16. The High Court has held that appointment of a member under the 
category specified in Section 10-FD(3)(f), can have a role only in matters 
concerning revival and rehabilitation of sick industrial companies and not in 
relation to other matters. The High Court has therefore virtually indicated 
that NCLT should have two divisions, that is an Adjudication Division and a 
Rehabilitation Division and persons selected under the category specified 
in clause (f) should only be appointed as Members of the Rehabilitation 
Division. 
17. The Union Government contends that similar provision exists in 
Section 4(3) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 
1985; that the provision is only an enabling one so that the best talent can 
be selected by the Selection Committee headed by the Chief Justice of 
India or his nominee; and that it may not be advisable to have division or 
limit or place restrictions on the power of the President of the Tribunal to 
constitute appropriate benches. It is also pointed out that a technical 
member would always sit in a Bench with a judicial member. 
Section 10-FD(3)(g): Qualification for appointment of Technical Member 
18. The High Court has observed that in regard to the Presiding Officers 
of the Labour Courts and the Industrial Tribunals or the National Industrial 
Tribunal, a minimum period of three to five years' experience should be 
prescribed, as what is sought to be utilised is their expert knowledge in 
labour laws. 
19. The Union Government submits that it may be advisable to leave the 
choice of selection of the most appropriate candidate to the Committee 
headed by the Chief Justice of India or his nominee. 
20. The High Court has also observed that as persons who satisfy the 
qualifications prescribed in Section 10-FD(3)(g) would be persons who fall 
under Section 10-FD(2)(a), it would be more appropriate to include this 
qualification in Section 10-FD(2)(a). It has also observed in Section 10-FL 
dealing with "Benches of the Tribunal", a provision should be made that a 
"judicial member" with this qualification shall be a member of the Special 
Bench referred to in Section 10-FL(2) for cases relating to rehabilitation, 
restructuring or winding up of companies. 
21. The Union Government has not accepted these findings and 
contends that the observations of the High Court would amount to judicial 
legislation. 
Section 10-FD(3)(h): Qualification of Technical Member of NCLT 
22. The High Court has observed that clause (h) referring to the 
category of persons having special knowledge of and experience in 
matters relating to labour, for not less than 15 years is vague and should 

162 


Page 163 

be suitably amended so as to spell out with certainty the qualification which 
a person to be appointed under clause (h) should possess. 
23. The Union Government contends that in view of the wide and varied 
experience possible in labour matters, it may not be advisable to set out 
the nature of experience or impose any restrictions in regard to the nature 
of experience. It is submitted that the Selection Committee headed by the 
Chief Justice of India or his nominee would consider each application on 
its own merits. 
24. The second observation of the High Court is that the member 
selected under the category mentioned in clause (h) must confine his 
participation only to the Benches dealing with revival and rehabilitation of 
sick companies and should also be excluded from functioning as a single-
Member Bench for any matter. 
25. The Union Government contends that it may not be advisable to 
fetter the prerogative of the President of the Tribunal to constitute benches 
by making use of available members. It is also pointed out that it may not 
be proper to presume that a person well versed in labour matters will be 
unsuitable to be associated with a judicial member in regard to 
adjudication of winding-up matters. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
Section 10-FX: Selection process for President/Chairperson 
31. The High Court has expressed the view that the selection of the 
President/Chairperson should be by a Committee headed by the Chief 
Justice of India in consultation with two senior Judges of the Supreme 
Court. 
32. The Union Government has submitted that it would not be advisable 
to make such a provision in regard to appointment of the 
President/Chairperson of statutory tribunals. It is pointed out that no other 
legislation constituting tribunals has such a provision." 

In order to assail the challenge to the provisions extracted hereinabove, the 

Union of India asserted, that the Madras High Court (the judgment whereof was, 

also under challenge) having held that the Parliament had the competence and 

the power to establish the National Company Law Tribunal and the National 

Company Law Appellate Tribunal, ought to have dismissed the writ petition. The 

assertion at the hands of the Union of India was, that some of the directions 

contained in the judgment rendered by the Madras High Court, reframed and 

recast Parts 1B and 1C introduced by the Amendment Act and amounted to 

163 


Page 164 

converting "judicial review" into judicial legislation. It was, however noticed, that 

the Union of India having agreed to rectify several of the defects pointed out by 

the High Court, the appeal of the Union of India was restricted to the findings of 

the High Court relating to Sections 10-FD(3)(f), (g), (h) and 10-FX. To 

understand the tenor of the issue which was the subject matter before this Court, 

it is relevant to extract some of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 as 

amended by the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002, relating to the 

constitution of the National Company Law Tribunal and the National Company 

Law Appellate Tribunal). The same are reproduced hereunder:-

(a) the reference therein to a High Court shall be construed as including 
a reference to the Appellate Tribunal; 
(b) the reference to Advocate General in Section 15 of the said Act shall 
be construed as a reference to such law officers as the Central 
Government may specify in this behalf.

Appeal to Supreme Court.-Any person aggrieved by any 
decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the 
Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the 
decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal to him on any question of law 
arising out of such decision or order: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal within 
the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding 
sixty days." 

Having noticed the relevant statutory provisions, this Court made detailed 

observations relating to "difference between Courts and Tribunals", "Re: 

independence of judiciary", "separation of powers", and "whether the 

Government can transfer judicial functions traditionally performed by Courts, to 

Tribunals", as under:-

169

"70. But in India, unfortunately tribunals have not achieved full 
independence. The Secretary of the "sponsoring department" concerned 
sits in the Selection Committee for appointment. When the tribunals are 
formed, they are mostly dependent on their sponsoring department for 
funding, infrastructure and even space for functioning. The statutes 
constituting tribunals routinely provide for members of civil services from 
the sponsoring departments becoming members of the tribunal and 
continuing their lien with their parent cadre. Unless wide ranging reforms 
as were implemented in United Kingdom and as were suggested by L. 
Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261, are brought about, 
tribunals in India will not be considered as independent. 
Whether the Government can transfer the judicial functions traditionally 
performed by courts to tribunals? 
71. It is well settled that courts perform all judicial functions of the State 
except those that are excluded by law from their jurisdiction. Section 9 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, for example, provides that the courts shall 
have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which 
their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. 
72. Article 32 provides that without prejudice to the powers conferred on 
the Supreme Court by clauses (1) and (2) of the said Article, Parliament 
may by law, empower any other court to exercise within the local limits of 
its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court 
under clause (2) of Article 32. 
73. Article 247 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in 
Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution, Parliament may by law provide for 
the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of 
laws made by Parliament or of any existing laws with respect to a matter 
enumerated in the Union List. Article 245 provides that subject to the 
provisions of the Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or 
any part of the territory of India, and the legislature of a State may make 
laws for the whole or any part of the State. 
74. Article 246 deals with the subject-matter of laws made by Parliament 
and by the legislatures of States. The Union List (List I of the Seventh 
Schedule) enumerates the matters with respect to which Parliament has 
exclusive powers to make laws. Entry 77 of List I refers to constitution, 
organisation, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court. Entry 78 of 
List I refers to constitution and organisation of the High Courts. Entry 79 of 
List I refers to extension or exclusion of the jurisdiction of a High Court, to 
or from any Union Territory. Entry 43 of List I refers to incorporation, 
regulation and winding up of trading corporations and Entry 44 of List I 
refers to incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations. Entry 95 
of List I refers to jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Supreme 
Court, with respect to any of the matters in the Union List. 
75. The Concurrent List (List III of the Seventh Schedule) enumerates 
the matters with respect to which Parliament and the Legislature of a State 

170 


Page 171 

will have concurrent power to make laws. Entry 11-A of List III refers to 
administration of justice, constitution and organization of all courts except 
the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Entry 46 of List III refers to 
jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with 
respect to any of the matters in List III. 
76. Part XIV-A was inserted in the Constitution with effect from 3-1-1977 
by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The said part 
contains two articles. Article 323-A relates to Administrative Tribunals and 
empowers Parliament to make a law, providing for the adjudication or trial 
by Administrative Tribunals of disputes and complaints with respect to 
recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public 
services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Government or of 
any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of India or 
under the control of the Government of India or of any corporation owned 
or controlled by the Government. 
xxx

80. The legislative competence of Parliament to provide for creation of 
courts and tribunals can be traced to Entries 77, 78, 79 and Entries 43, 44 
read with Entry 95 of List I, Entry 11-A read with Entry 46 of List III of the 
Seventh Schedule. Referring to these articles, this Court in two cases, 
namely, Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar Assn., (2002) 4 SCC 75, 
and State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society, 
(2003) 2 SCC 412, held that Articles 323-A and 323-B are enabling 
provisions which enable the setting up of tribunals contemplated therein; 
and that the said articles, however, cannot be interpreted to mean that they 
prohibited the legislature from establishing tribunals not covered by those 
articles, as long as there is legislative competence under the appropriate 
entry in the Seventh Schedule. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
90. But when we say that the legislature has the competence to make 
laws, providing which disputes will be decided by courts, and which 
disputes will be decided by tribunals, it is subject to constitutional 
limitations, without encroaching upon the independence of the judiciary 
and keeping in view the principles of the rule of law and separation of 
powers. If tribunals are to be vested with judicial power hitherto vested in 
or exercised by courts, such tribunals should possess the independence, 
security and capacity associated with courts. If the tribunals are intended 
to serve an area which requires specialised knowledge or expertise, no 
doubt there can be technical members in addition to judicial members. 
Where however jurisdiction to try certain category of cases are transferred 
from courts to tribunals only to expedite the hearing and disposal or relieve 
from the rigours of the Evidence Act and procedural laws, there is 
obviously no need to have any non-judicial technical member. In respect of 
such tribunals, only members of the judiciary should be the Presiding 
Officers/Members. Typical examples of such special tribunals are Rent 

171 


Page 172 

Tribunals, Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals and Special Courts under 
several enactments. Therefore, when transferring the jurisdiction exercised 
by courts to tribunals, which does not involve any specialised knowledge or 
expertise in any field and expediting the disposal and relaxing the 
procedure is the only object, a provision for technical members in addition 
to or in substitution of judicial members would clearly be a case of dilution 
of and encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary and the rule 
of law and would be unconstitutional. 
91 
In R.K. Jain v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 119, this Court 
observed: (SCC pp. 169-70, para 67) 
"67. The tribunals set up under Articles 323-A and 323-B of the 
Constitution or under an Act of legislature are creatures of the 
statute and in no case claim the status as Judges of the High Court 
or parity or as substitutes. However, the personnel appointed to hold 
those offices under the State are called upon to discharge judicial or 
quasi-judicial powers. So they must have judicial approach and also 
knowledge and expertise in that particular branch of constitutional, 
administrative and tax laws. The legal input would undeniably be 
more important and sacrificing the legal input and not giving it 
sufficient weightage and teeth would definitely impair the efficacy 
and effectiveness of the judicial adjudication. It is, therefore, 
necessary that those who adjudicate upon these matters should 
have legal expertise, judicial experience and modicum of legal 
training as on many an occasion different and complex questions of 
law which baffle the minds of even trained Judges in the High Court 
and Supreme Court would arise for discussion and decision." 
92. Having held that legislation can transfer certain areas of litigation 
from courts to tribunals and recognising that the legislature can provide for 
technical members in addition to judicial members in such tribunals, let us 
turn our attention to the question as to who can be the members. 
93. If the Act provides for a tribunal with a judicial member and a 
technical member, does it mean that there are no limitations upon the 
power of the legislature to prescribe the qualifications for such technical 
member? The question will also be whether any limitations can be read 
into the competence of the legislature to prescribe the qualification for the 
judicial member? The answer, of course, depends upon the nature of 
jurisdiction that is being transferred from the courts to tribunals. Logically 
and necessarily, depending upon whether the jurisdiction is being shifted 
from a High Court, or a District Court or a Civil Judge, the yardstick will 
differ. It is for the court which considers the challenge to the qualification, 
to determine whether the legislative power has been exercised in a 
manner in consonance with the constitutional principles and constitutional 
guarantees.

101. Independent judicial tribunals for determination of the rights of 
citizens, and for adjudication of the disputes and complaints of the citizens, 
is a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. The rule of law has several 
facets, one of which is that disputes of citizens will be decided by Judges 
who are independent and impartial; and that disputes as to legality of acts 
of the Government will be decided by Judges who are independent of the 
executive. Another facet of the rule of law is equality before law. The 
essence of the equality is that it must be capable of being enforced and 
adjudicated by an independent judicial forum. Judicial independence and 
separation of judicial power from the executive are part of the common law 
traditions implicit in a Constitution like ours which is based on the 
Westminster model. 
102. The fundamental right to equality before law and equal protection of 
laws guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution, clearly includes a right to 
have the person's rights, adjudicated by a forum which exercises judicial 
power in an impartial and independent manner, consistent with the 
recognised principles of adjudication. Therefore wherever access to courts 
to enforce such rights is sought to be abridged, altered, modified or 
substituted by directing him to approach an alternative forum, such 
legislative Act is open to challenge if it violates the right to adjudication by 
an independent forum. Therefore, though the challenge by MBA is on the 
ground of violation of principles forming part of the basic structure, they are 
relatable to one or more of the express provisions of the Constitution which 
gave rise to such principles. Though the validity of the provisions of a 
legislative Act cannot be challenged on the ground it violates the basic 
structure of the Constitution, it can be challenged as violative of 
constitutional provisions which enshrine the principles of the rule of law, 
separation of powers and independence of the judiciary. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
106. We may summarise the position as follows: 
(a) A legislature can enact a law transferring the jurisdiction exercised 
by courts in regard to any specified subject (other than those which are 
vested in courts by express provisions of the Constitution) to any 
tribunal. 
(b) All courts are tribunals. Any tribunal to which any existing jurisdiction 
of courts is transferred should also be a judicial tribunal. This means 
that such tribunal should have as members, persons of a rank, capacity 
and status as nearly as possible equal to the rank, status and capacity 
of the court which was till then dealing with such matters and the 
members of the tribunal should have the independence and security of 
tenure associated with judicial tribunals. 
(c) Whenever there is need for "tribunals", there is no presumption that 
there should be technical members in the tribunals. When any 
jurisdiction is shifted from courts to tribunals, on the ground of 
pendency and delay in courts, and the jurisdiction so transferred does 

173 


Page 174 

not involve any technical aspects requiring the assistance of experts, 
the tribunals should normally have only judicial members. Only where 
the exercise of jurisdiction involves inquiry and decisions into technical 
or special aspects, where presence of technical members will be useful 
and necessary, tribunals should have technical members. 
Indiscriminate appointment of technical members in all tribunals will 
dilute and adversely affect the independence of the judiciary. 
(d) The legislature can reorganise the jurisdictions of judicial tribunals. 
For example, it can provide that a specified category of cases tried by a 
higher court can be tried by a lower court or vice versa (a standard 
example is the variation of pecuniary limits of the courts). Similarly while 
constituting 
tribunals, 
the 
legislature 
can 
prescribe 
the 
qualifications/eligibility criteria. The same is however subject to judicial 
review. If the court in exercise of judicial review is of the view that such 
tribunalisation would adversely affect the independence of the judiciary 
or the standards of the judiciary, the court may interfere to preserve the 
independence and standards of the judiciary. Such an exercise will be 
part of the checks and balances measures to maintain the separation of 
powers and to prevent any encroachment, intentional or unintentional, 
by either the legislature or by the executive. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
113. When the Administrative Tribunals were constituted, the presence of 
members of civil services as Technical (Administrative) Members was 
considered necessary, as they were well versed in the functioning of 
government departments and the rules and procedures applicable to 
government servants. But the fact that senior officers of civil services could 
function as Administrative Members of the Administrative Tribunals, does 
not necessarily make them suitable to function as technical members in 
the Company Law Tribunals or other tribunals requiring technical 
expertise. The tribunals cannot become providers of sinecure to members 
of civil services, by appointing them as technical members, though they 
may not have technical expertise in the field to which the tribunals relate, 
or worse, where purely judicial functions are involved. While one can 
understand the presence of the members of the civil services being 
technical members in Administrative Tribunals, or Military Officers being 
members of the Armed Forces Tribunals, or electrical engineers being 
members of the Electricity Appellate Tribunal, or telecom engineers being 
members of TDSAT, we find no logic in members of the general civil 
services being members of the Company Law Tribunals. 
114. Let us now refer to the dilution of independence. If any member of 
the tribunal is permitted to retain his lien over his post with the parent 
cadre or ministry or department in the civil service for his entire period of 
service as member of the tribunal, he would continue to think, act and 
function as a member of the civil services. A litigant may legitimately think 
that such a member will not be independent and impartial. We reiterate 

174 


Page 175 

that our observations are not intended to cast any doubt about the honesty 
and integrity or capacity and capability of the officers of civil services in 
particular those who are of the rank of Joint Secretary or for that matter 
even junior officers. What we are referring to is the perception of the 
litigants and the public about the independence or conduct of the members 
of the tribunal. Independence, impartiality and fairness are qualities which 
have to be nurtured and developed and cannot be acquired overnight. The 
independence of members discharging judicial functions in a tribunal 
cannot be diluted. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
120. We may tabulate the corrections required to set right the defects in 
Parts I-B and I-C of the Act: 
(i) Only Judges and advocates can be considered for appointment as 
judicial members of the Tribunal. Only High Court Judges, or Judges 
who have served in the rank of a District Judge for at least five years or 
a person who has practised as a lawyer for ten years can be 
considered for appointment as a judicial member. Persons who have 
held a Group A or equivalent post under the Central or State 
Government with experience in the Indian Company Law Service (Legal 
Branch) and the Indian Legal Service (Grade I) cannot be considered 
for appointment as judicial members as provided in sub-sections (2)(c) 
and (d) of Section 10-FD. The expertise in Company Law Service or the 
Indian Legal Service will at best enable them to be considered for 
appointment as technical members. 
(ii) As NCLT takes over the functions of the High Court, the members 
should as nearly as possible have the same position and status as High 
Court Judges. This can be achieved, not by giving the salary and perks 
of a High Court Judge to the members, but by ensuring that persons 
who are as nearly equal in rank, experience or competence to High 
Court Judges are appointed as members. Therefore, only officers who 
are holding the ranks of Secretaries or Additional Secretaries alone can 
be considered for appointment as technical members of the National 
Company Law Tribunal. Clauses (c) and (d) of sub-section (2) and 
clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 10-FD which provide 
for persons with 15 years experience in Group A post or persons 
holding the post of Joint Secretary or equivalent post in the Central or 
the State Government, being qualified for appointment as Members of 
Tribunal, are invalid. 
(iii) A "technical member" presupposes an experience in the field to 
which the Tribunal relates. A member of the Indian Company Law 
Service who has worked with Accounts Branch or officers in other 
departments who might have incidentally dealt with some aspect of 
company law cannot be considered as "experts" qualified to be 
appointed as technical members. Therefore clauses (a) and (b) of sub-
section (3) are not valid. 

175 


Page 176 

(iv) The first part of clause (f) of sub-section (3) providing that any 
person having special knowledge or professional experience of 20 
years in science, technology, economics, banking, industry could be 
considered to be persons with expertise in company law, for being 
appointed as technical members in the Company Law Tribunal, is 
invalid. 
(v) Persons having ability, integrity, standing and special knowledge 
and professional experience of not less than fifteen years in industrial 
finance, industrial management, industrial reconstruction, investment 
and accountancy, may however be considered as persons having 
expertise in rehabilitation/revival of companies and therefore, eligible 
for being considered for appointment as technical members. 
(vi) In regard to category of persons referred in clause (g) of sub-
section (3) at least five years' experience should be specified. 
(vii) Only clauses (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), and the latter part of clause (f) in 
sub-section (3) of Section 10-FD and officers of civil services of the 
rank of the Secretary or Additional Secretary in the Indian Company 
Law Service and the Indian Legal Service can be considered for 
purposes of appointment as technical members of the Tribunal. 
(viii) Instead of a five-member Selection Committee with the Chief 
Justice of India (or his nominee) as Chairperson and two Secretaries 
from the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs and the Secretary in 
the Ministry of Labour and the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and 
Justice as members mentioned in Section 10-FX, the Selection 
Committee should broadly be on the following lines: 
(a) Chief Justice of India or his nominee-Chairperson (with a 
casting vote); 
(b) A Senior Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of High 
Court-Member; 
(c) Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs-
Member; and 
(d) Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice-Member. 
(ix) The term of office of three years shall be changed to a term of 
seven or five years subject to eligibility for appointment for one more 
term. This is because considerable time is required to achieve expertise 
in the field concerned. A term of three years is very short and by the 
time the members achieve the required knowledge, expertise and 
efficiency, one term will be over. Further the said term of three years 
with the retirement age of 65 years is perceived as having been tailor-
made for persons who have retired or shortly to retire and encourages 
these Tribunals to be treated as post-retirement havens. If these 
Tribunals are to function effectively and efficiently they should be able 
to attract younger members who will have a reasonable period of 
service. 

176 


Page 177 

(x) The second proviso to Section 10-FE enabling the President and 
members to retain lien with their parent cadre/ministry/department while 
holding office as President or Members will not be conducive for the 
independence of members. Any person appointed as member should 
be prepared to totally disassociate himself from the executive. The lien 
cannot therefore exceed a period of one year. 
(xi) To maintain independence and security in service, sub-section (3) 
of Section 10-FJ and Section 10-FV should provide that suspension of 
the President/Chairman or member of a Tribunal can be only with the 
concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. 
(xii) The administrative support for all Tribunals should be from the 
Ministry of Law and Justice. Neither the Tribunals nor their members 
shall seek or be provided with facilities from the respective sponsoring 
or parent Ministries or Department concerned. 
(xiii) Two-member Benches of the Tribunal should always have a 
judicial member. Whenever any larger or special Benches are 
constituted, the number of technical members shall not exceed the 
judicial members." 

62. Before venturing to examine the controversy in hand it needs to be 

noticed, that some of the assertions raised at the hands of the petitioners in the 

present controversy have since been resolved. These have been noticed in an 

order passed by this Court in Madras Bar Association v. Union of India, (2010) 11 

SCC 67, which is being extracted hereunder:-

"1. 
In all these petitions, the constitutional validity of the National Tax 
Tribunal Act, 2005 ("the Act", for short) is challenged. In TC No. 150 of 
2006, additionally there is a challenge to Section 46 of the Constitution 
(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 and Article 323-B of the Constitution 
of India. It is contended that Section 46 of the Constitution (Forty-second 
Amendment) Act, is ultra vires the basic structure of the Constitution as it 
enables proliferation of the tribunal system and makes serious inroads into 
the independence of the judiciary by providing a parallel system of 
administration of justice, in which the executive has retained extensive 
control over matters such as appointment, jurisdiction, procedure, etc. It is 
contended that Article 323-B violates the basic structure of the Constitution 
as it completely takes away the jurisdiction of the High Courts and vests 
them in the National Tax Tribunal, including trial of offences and 
adjudication of pure questions of law, which have always been in the 
exclusive domain of the judiciary. 

177 


Page 178 

2. 
When these matters came up on 9-1-2007 before a three-Judge 
Bench, the challenge to various sections of the Act was noticed. 
3. 
The first challenge was to Section 13 which permitted "any person" 
duly authorised to appear before the National Tax Tribunal. The Union of 
India submitted that the appropriate amendment will be made in the Act to 
ensure that only lawyers, chartered accountants and parties in person will 
be permitted to appear before the National Tax Tribunal. 
4. The second challenge was to Section 5(5) of the Act which provided 
that: 

"5. (5) The Central Government may in consultation with the 
Chairperson transfer a member from headquarters of one Bench in 
one State to the headquarters of another Bench in another State or 
to the headquarters of any other Bench within a State:" 

5. The Union of India submitted that having regard to the nature of the 
functions to be performed by the Tribunal and the constitutional scheme of 
separation of powers and independence of judiciary, the expression 
"consultation with the Chairperson" occurring in Section 5(5) of the Act 
should be read and construed as "concurrence of the Chairperson". 
6. The third challenge was to Section 7 which provided for a Selection 
Committee comprising of (a) the Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the 
Supreme Court nominated by him, (b) Secretary in the Ministry of Law and 
Justice, and (c) Secretary in the Ministry of Finance. It was contended by 
the petitioners that two of the members who are Secretaries to the 
Government forming the majority may override the opinion of the Chief 
Justice or his nominee which was improper. It was stated on behalf of the 
Union of India that there was no question of two Secretaries overriding the 
opinion of the Chief Justice of India or his nominee since primacy of the 
Chairperson was inbuilt in the system and this aspect will be duly clarified. 
7. In regard to certain other defects in the Act, pointed out by the 
petitioners, it was submitted that the Union Government will examine them 
and wherever necessary suitable amendments will be made. 
8. In view of these submissions, on 9-1-2007, this Court made an order 
reserving liberty to the Union Government to mention the matter for listing 
after the appropriate amendments were made in the Act. 
9. On 21-1-2009, when arguments in CA No. 3067 of 2004 and CA No. 
3717 of 2005, which related to the challenge to Parts I-B and I-C of the 
Companies Act, 1956 were in progress before the Constitution Bench, it 
was submitted that these matters involved a similar issue and they could 
be tagged and disposed of in terms of the decision in those appeals. 
Therefore the Constitution Bench directed these cases to be listed with 
those appeals, even though there is no order of reference in these matters. 
CA No. 3067 of 2004 and CA No. 3717 of 2005 were subsequently heard 
at length and were reserved for judgment. These matters which were 
tagged were also reserved for judgment. 

178 


Page 179 

10. We have disposed of CA No. 3067 of 2004 and CA No. 3717 of 2005 
today (Union of India vs. Madras Bar Association, (2010) 11 SCC 1), by a 
separate order. Insofar as these cases are concerned, we find that TC 
(Civil) No. 150 of 2006 involves the challenge to Article 323-B of the 
Constitution. The said article enables appropriate legislatures to provide by 
law, for adjudication or trial by tribunals or any disputes, complaints, or 
offences with respect to all or any of the matters specified in clause (2) 
thereof. Sub-clause (i) of clause (2) of Article 323-B enables such tribunals 
to try offences against laws with respect to any of the matters specified in 
sub-clauses (a) to (h) of clause (2) of the said article. 
11. One of the contentions urged in support of the challenge to Article 323-
B relate to the fact that tribunals do not follow the normal rules of evidence 
contained in the Evidence Act, 1872. In criminal trials, an accused is 
presumed to be innocent till proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and 
the Evidence Act plays an important role, as appreciation of evidence and 
consequential findings of facts are crucial. The trial would require 
experience and expertise in criminal law, which means that the Judge or 
the adjudicator to be legally trained. Tribunals which follow their own 
summary procedure, are not bound by the strict rules of evidence and the 
members will not be legally trained. Therefore it may lead to convictions of 
persons on evidence which is not sufficient in probative value or on the 
basis of inadmissible evidence. It is submitted that it would thus be a 
retrograde step for separation of executive from the judiciary. 
12. Appeals on issues on law are traditionally heard by the courts. Article 
323-B enable constitution of tribunals which will be hearing appeals on 
pure questions of law which is the function of the courts. In L. Chandra 
Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261, this Court considered the 
validity of only clause (3)(d) of Article 323-B but did not consider the 
validity of other provisions of Article 323-B. 
13. The appeals relating to constitutional validity of the National Company 
Law Tribunals under the Companies Act, 1956 did not involve the 
consideration of Article 323-B. The constitutional issues raised in TC (Civil) 
No. 150 of 2006 were not touched on as the power to establish Company 
Tribunals was not traceable to Article 323-B but to several entries of Lists I 
and III of the Seventh Schedule and consequently there was no challenge 
to this article. 
14. The basis of attack in regard to Parts I-B and I-C of the Companies Act 
and the provisions of the NTT Act are completely different. The challenge 
to Parts I-B and I-C of the Companies Act, 1956 seeks to derive support 
from Article 323-B by contending that Article 323-B is a bar for constitution 
of any tribunal in respect of matters not enumerated therein. On the other 
hand the challenge to the NTT Act is based on the challenge to Article 
323-B itself. 
15. We therefore find that these petitions relating to the validity of the NTT 
Act and the challenge to Article 323-B raise issues which did not arise in 

179 


Page 180 

the two civil appeals. Therefore these cases cannot be disposed of in 
terms of the decision in the civil appeals but require to be heard 
separately. We accordingly direct that these matters be delinked and listed 
separately for hearing." 

63(i) A perusal of the judgment rendered in Kesavananda Bharati case (supra) 

reveals, that "separation of powers" creates a system of checks and balances, by 

reasons of which, powers are so distributed, that none of the three organs 

transgresses into the domain of the other. The concept ensures the dignity of the 

individual. The power of "judicial review" ensures, that executive functioning 

confines itself within the framework of law enacted by the legislature. 

Accordingly, the demarcation of powers between the legislature, the executive 

and the judiciary, is regarded as the basic element of the constitutional scheme. 

When the judicial process is prevented by law, from determining whether the 

action taken, was or was not, within the framework of the legislation enacted, it 

would amount to the transgression of the adjudicatory/determinatory process by 

the legislature. Therefore, the exclusion of the power of "judicial review", would 

strike at the "basic structure" of the Constitution. 

(ii) 
In Indira Nehru Gandhi case (supra), this Court arrived at the conclusion, 

that clause (4) of Article 329A of the Constitution, destroyed not only the power of 

"judicial review", but also the rule of "separation of powers". By the above 

legislative provision, an election declared void, on the culmination of an 

adjudicatory process, was treated as valid. Meaning thereby, that the judicial 

process was substituted by a legislative pronouncement. It was held, that the 

issue to be focused on was, whether the amendment which was sought to be 

180 


Page 181 

assailed, violated a principle which constituted the "basic structure" of the 

Constitution. The argument raised in opposition was, that a determination which 

had a bearing on just one (or a few) individual(s) would not raise such an issue. 

The query was answered by concluding, that it would make no difference 

whether it related to one case, or a large number of cases. Encroachment on the 

"basic structure" of the Constitution would be invalid, irrespective of whether, it 

related to a limited number of individuals or a large number of people. The view 

expressed was, that if lawmakers were to be assigned the responsibility of 

administering those laws, and dispensing justice, then those governed by such 

laws would be left without a remedy in case they were subjected to injustice. For 

the above reason, clause (4) of Article 329A was declared invalid. This Court by 

majority held, that clauses (4) and (5) of Article 329A were unconstitutional and 

void. 

(iii) In Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra), first and foremost, this Court confirmed 

the view expressed in Kesavananda Bharati case (supra) and Indira Nehru 

Gandhi case (supra), that the amending power of the Parliament, was not 

absolute. The Parliament, it was maintained, did not have the power to amend 

the "basic structure" of the Constitution. A legislative assertion, that the enacted 

law had been made, for giving effect to a policy to secure the provisions made in 

Part IV of the Constitution, had the effect of excluding the adjudicatory process. 

In the case on hand, this Court arrived at the conclusion, that Section 4 of the 

Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act was beyond the amending power of 

the Parliament, and the same was void, because it had the effect of damaging 

181 


Page 182 

the basic and essential features of the Constitution and destroying its "basic 

structure", by totally excluding any challenge to any law, even on the ground, 

whether it was inconsistent with or it had abridged, any of the rights conferred by 

Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. Furthermore, Section 55 of the 

Constitution (Forty-second Amendment), Act was held to be beyond the 

amending power of the Parliament. It was held to be void, as it had the effect of 

removing all limitations on the powers of Parliament, to amend the Constitution 

including, the power to alter its basic and essential features, i.e., its "basic 

structure". According to this Court, the reason for a broad "separation of powers" 

under the Constitution was, because concentration of powers in any one of the 

organs of the Government, would destroy the foundational premise of a 

democratic Government. The illustrations narrated in the judgment are of some 

relevance. We shall therefore, narrate them hereunder, in our own words: 

(a) 
Take for example a case where the executive, which is in-charge of 

administration, acts to the prejudice of a citizen. And a question arises, as to 

what are the powers of the executive, and whether the executive had acted 

within the scope of its powers. Such a question obviously, cannot be left to 

the executive to decide, for two very good reasons. Firstly, because the 

decision would depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution or the laws, 

which are, pre-eminently fit to be decided by the judiciary, as it is the judiciary 

alone which would be possessed of the expertise in decision making. And 

secondly, because the legal protection afforded to citizens by the Constitution 

182 


Page 183 

or the laws would become illusory, if it were left to the executive to determine 

the legality, of its own actions. 

(b) 
Take for example, a case where the legislature makes a law, which 

is to the prejudice of a citizen. And a dispute arises, whether in making the 

law the legislature had acted outside the area of its legislative competence, or 

whether the law was violative of the fundamental rights of the citizen, or of 

some other provision(s) of law. Its resolution cannot be left to the legislature 

to decide, for two very good reasons. Firstly, because the decision would 

depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution or the laws, which are, pre-

eminently fit to be decided by the judiciary, as it is the judiciary alone which 

would be possessed of the expertise in decision making. And secondly, 

because the legal protection afforded to citizens, by the Constitution or the 

laws would become illusory, if it were left to the legislature to determine the 

legality of its own actions. 

On the basis of the examples cited above, this Court concluded, that the creation 

of an independent machinery, for resolving disputes, was constitutionally vested 

with the judiciary. The judiciary was vested with the power of "judicial review", to 

determine the legality of executive action, and the validity of laws enacted by 

legislature. It was further held, that it was the solemn duty of the judiciary under 

the Constitution, to keep the different organs of the State, such as the executive 

and the legislature, within the limits of the powers conferred upon them by the 

Constitution. It was accordingly also held, that the power of "judicial review" was 

an integral part of India's constitutional system, and without it, the "rule of law" 

183 


Page 184 

would become a teasing illusion, and a promise of unreality. Premised on the 

aforesaid inferences, this Court finally concluded, that if there was one feature of 

the Indian Constitution, which more than any others, was its "basic structure" 

fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the "rule of law", it was the 

power of "judicial review". While recording the aforementioned conclusion, this 

Court also recorded a clarificatory note, namely, that it should not be taken, that 

an effective alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement for "judicial 

review" could not be made by Parliament. It was, however, clearly emphasized, 

that "judicial review" was a vital principle of the Indian Constitution, and it could 

not be abrogated, without affecting the "basic structure" of the Constitution. It is 

therefore, that it came to be held, that a constitutional amendment, which had the 

effect of taking away the power of "judicial review", by providing, that it would not 

be liable to be questioned, on any ground, was held to be beyond the amending 

power of the Parliament. For, that would make the Parliament the sole judge, of 

the constitutional validity, of what it had done, and thereby, allow it to determine 

the legality of its own actions. In the above judgment, the critical reflection, in our 

considered view was expressed by the words, "Human ingenuity, limitless though 

it may be, has yet not devised a system, by which the liberty of the people can be 

protected, except for the intervention of the courts of law". 

(iv) In S.P. Gupta case (supra), the concept of "independence of judiciary" 

came up for consideration before this Court. This Court having examined the 

issue, arrived at certain conclusions with reference to High Court and Supreme 

Court Judges. It was held, that their appointment and removal, as also their 

184 


Page 185 

transfer, deserved to be preserved, within the framework of the judicial fraternity. 

Likewise, the foundation of appointment of outside Chief Justices, was made with 

a similar objective. Based on the same, parameters were also laid down, in 

respect of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court. The consideration even 

extended to the appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. All this, 

for ensuring judicial autonomy. It was felt that independence of the judiciary, 

could be preserved only if primacy in the above causes rested with the judiciary 

itself, with a minimal involvement of the executive and the legislature. It needs to 

be highlighted, that independence of judges of the High Courts and the Supreme 

Court was considered as salient, to ensure due exercise of the power of "judicial 

review". It would be pertinent to mention, that the judgment rendered by this 

Court in S.P. Gupta case (supra) came to be doubted in Subhash Sharma v. 

Union of India, (1991) Suppl. 1 SCC 574. Thereupon, the matter was 

reconsidered by a constitution bench of nine Judges in, Supreme Court 

Advocates on Record Association v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 441. On the 

subject of preserving independence in respect of appointment of judges of the 

High Courts, as also their transfer, the position recorded earlier in S.P.Gupta 

case (supra) remained substantially unaltered. So also, of appointments of Chief 

Justices of High Courts and the Supreme Court. It was reiterated, that to ensure 

judicial independence, primacy in all these matters should be with the judiciary. 

(v) 
Having recorded the determination rendered by this Court to the effect that 

"separation of powers", "rule of law" and "judicial review" at the hands of an 

independent judiciary, constitute the "basic structure" of the Constitution, we are 

185 


Page 186 

in a position now to determine, how the aforesaid concepts came to be 

adopted by this Court, while adjudicating upon the validity of provisions similar to 

the ones, which are subject of consideration, in the case on hand. The first 

controversy arose with reference to the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, which 

was enacted under Article 323A of the Constitution. In S.P. Sampath Kumar 

case (supra), it was sought to be concluded, that the power of "judicial review" 

had been negated by the aforementioned enactment, inasmuch as, the avenue 

of redress under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution before the High Court, 

was no longer available. It was also sought to be asserted, that the tribunal 

constituted under the enactment, being a substitute of the High Court, ought to 

have been constituted in a manner, that it would be able to function in the same 

manner as the High Court itself. Since insulation of the judiciary from all forms of 

interference, even from the coordinate branches of the Government, was by now 

being perceived as a basic essential feature of the Constitution, it was felt that 

the same independence from possibility of executive pressure or influence, 

needed to be ensured for the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Members of the 

administrative tribunal. In recording its conclusions, even though it was 

maintained, that "judicial review" was an integral part of the "basic structure" of 

the Constitution, yet it was held, that Parliament was competent to amend the 

Constitution, and substitute in place of the High Court, another alternative 

institutional mechanism or arrangement. This Court, however cautioned, that it 

was imperative to ensure, that the alternative arrangement, was no less 

independent, and no less judicious, than the High Court (which was sought to be 

186 


Page 187 

replaced) itself. 
This was conveyed by observing, "if any constitutional 

amendment made by the Parliament takes away from the High Court the power 

of "judicial review" in any particular area, and vests it in any other institutional 

mechanism or authority, it would not be violative of the basic structure doctrine 

so long as the essential condition is fulfilled, namely, that the alternative 

institutional mechanism or authority set up by the Parliament by amendment is 

no less effective than the High Court". The exclusion of the High Courts' 

jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, it was held, would 

render the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 unconstitutional, unless the 

amendments to the provisions of Sections 4, 6 and 8 thereof, as suggested by 

this Court, were carried out. Insofar as Section 4 is concerned, it was suggested 

that it must be amended so as not to confer absolute and unfettered discretion on 

the executive in matters of appointment of the Chairman, Vice Chairman and 

Members of the administrative tribunals. Section 6(1)(c) was considered to be 

invalid, and as such, needed to be deleted. It was also indicated, that 

appointment of Chairman, Vice Chairman and Administrative Members should be 

made by the executive, only in consultation with the Chief Justice of India, and 

that, such consultation had to be meaningful and effective, inasmuch as, 

ordinarily the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India ought to be accepted, 

unless there were cogent reasons not to. If there were any reasons, for not 

accepting the recommendation, they needed to be disclosed to the Chief Justice. 

Alternatively, it was commended, that a high powered Selection Committee 

headed by the Chief Justice or a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court, or of the 

187 


Page 188 

concerned High Court (nominated by the Chief Justice of India), could be set up 

for such selection. If either of these two modes of appointment was adopted, it 

was believed, that the impugned Act would be saved from invalidation. It was 

mentioned, that Section 6(2) also needed to be amended, so as to make a 

District Judge or an Advocate, who fulfilled the qualifications for appointment as a 

judge of the High Court, eligible for appointment as Vice Chairman. With 

reference to Section 8 it was felt, that a term of five years of office, would be too 

short and ought to be suitably extended. It was so felt, because the presently 

prescribed tenure would neither be convenient to the persons selected for the 

job, nor expedient to the scheme of adjudication contemplated under the 

Administrative Tribunals Act. It was also opined, that the Government ought to 

set up a permanent bench wherever there was a seat of the High Court. And if 

that was not feasible, at least a circuit bench of the administrative tribunal, 

wherever there is a seat of the High Court. That would alleviate the hardship, 

which would have to be faced by persons, who were not residing close to the 

places at which the benches of the tribunal were set up. In this behalf, it may 

only be stated that all the suggestions made by this Court were adopted. 

(vi) Post S.P. Sampath Kumar case (supra), divergent views came to be 

expressed in a number of judgments rendered by this Court. It is therefore, that 

the judgment in S.P. Sampath Kumar case (supra), came up for reconsideration 

in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra). On reconsideration, this Court declared, that 

the power of "judicial review" over legislative action was vested in the High 

Courts under Article 226, and in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the 

188 


Page 189 

Constitution. "Judicial review" was again held to be an integral and essential 

feature of the Constitution, constituting its "basic structure". It was further 

concluded, that ordinarily the power of High Courts and the Supreme Court, to 

test the constitutional validity of legislations, could never be ousted or excluded. 

It was also held, that the power vested in the High Courts of judicial 

superintendence over all Courts and tribunals within their respective jurisdictions, 

was also part of the "basic structure" of the Constitution. And that, a situation 

needed to be avoided where High Courts were divested from their judicial 

functions, besides the power of constitutional interpretation. Referring to the 

inappropriate and ineffective functioning of the tribunals, this Court observed, that 

the above malady was on account of lack of the responsibility, of fulfilling the 

administrative requirements of administrative tribunals. It was opined, that the 

malady could be remedied by creating a single umbrella organization, to ensure 

the independence of the members of such tribunals, and to provide funds for the 

fulfillment of their administrative requirements. Although the determination of the 

governmental organization, to discharge such a role was left open, it was 

recommended, that it should preferably be vested with the Law Department. 

With reference to the controversies which arose before the tribunals, it was held, 

that matters wherein interpretation of statutory provisions or rules, or where the 

provisions of the Constitution were expected to be construed, the same would 

have to be determined by a bench consisting of at least two Members, one of 

whom must be a Judicial Member. Having found that the provisions of the 

Administrative Tribunals Act, had impinged on the power of "judicial review" 

189 


Page 190 

vested in the High Court, clause (2)(d) of Article 323A and clause (3)(d) of Article 

323B, to the extent they excluded the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the 

Supreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, were held to 

be unconstitutional. Likewise, the "exclusion of jurisdiction" clauses in all other 

legislations enacted under the aegis of Articles 323A and 323B, were also held to 

be unconstitutional. In view of the above, it was concluded, that the jurisdiction 

conferred upon the High Court under Articles 226/227, and upon the Supreme 

Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, was a part of the inviolable "basic 

structure" of the Constitution. Since the said jurisdiction could not be ousted, 

jurisdiction vested in the tribunals would be deemed to be discharging a 

supplemental role, in the exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 226/227 

and 32 of the Constitution. Although it was affirmed, that such tribunals would be 

deemed to be possessed of the competence to test the constitutional validity of 

the statutory provisions and rules, it was provided, that all decisions of tribunals 

would be subject to scrutiny before a division bench of the High Court, within 

whose jurisdiction the concerned tribunal had passed the order. In the above 

view of the matter, it was held that the tribunals would act like courts of first 

instance, in respect of the areas of law, for which they had been constituted. 

After adjudication at the hands of the tribunals, it would be open for litigants to 

directly approach the High Courts. Section 5(6) of the Administrative Tribunals 

Act, interpreted in the manner indicated above, was bestowed with validity. 

(vii) In Union of India v. Madras Bar Association case (supra), all the 

conclusions/propositions narrated above, were reiterated and followed, 

190 


Page 191 

whereupon the fundamental requirements, which need to be kept in mind while 

transferring adjudicatory functions from courts to tribunals, were further 

crystalised. It came to be unequivocally recorded that tribunals vested with 

judicial power (hitherto before vested in, or exercised by courts), should possess 

the same independence, security and capacity, as the courts which the tribunals 

are mandated to substitute. The Members of the tribunals discharging judicial 

functions, could only be drawn from sources possessed of expertise in law, and 

competent to discharge judicial functions. Technical Members can be appointed 

to tribunals where technical expertise is essential for disposal of matters, and not 

otherwise. Therefore it was held, that where the adjudicatory process transferred 

to tribunals, did not involve any specialized skill, knowledge or expertise, a 

provision for appointment of Technical Members (in addition to, or in substitution 

of Judicial Members) would constitute a clear case of delusion and 

encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary, and the "rule of law". The 

stature of the members, who would constitute the tribunal, would depend on the 

jurisdiction which was being transferred to the tribunal. In other words, if the 

jurisdiction of the High Court was transferred to a tribunal, the stature of the 

members of the newly constituted tribunal, should be possessed of qualifications 

akin to the judges of the High Court. Whereas in case, the jurisdiction and the 

functions sought to be transferred were being exercised/performed by District 

Judges, the Members appointed to the tribunal should be possessed of 

equivalent qualifications and commensurate stature of District Judges. The 

conditions of service of the members should be such, that they are in a position 

191 


Page 192 

to discharge their duties in an independent and impartial manner. The manner of 

their appointment and removal including their transfer, and tenure of their 

employment, should have adequate protection so as to be shorn of legislative 

and executive interference. The functioning of the tribunals, their infrastructure 

and responsibility of fulfilling their administrative requirements ought to be 

assigned to the Ministry of Law and Justice. Neither the tribunals nor their 

members, should be required to seek any facilities from the parent ministries or 

department concerned. 
Even though the legislature can reorganize the 

jurisdiction of judicial tribunals, and can prescribe the qualifications/eligibility of 

members thereof, the same would be subject to "judicial review" wherein it would 

be open to a court to hold, that the tribunalization would adversely affect the 

adjudicatory standards, whereupon it would be open to a court to interfere 

therewith. Such an exercise would naturally be, a part of the checks and 

balances measures, conferred by the Constitution on the judiciary, to maintain 

the rule of "separation of powers" to prevent any encroachment by the legislature 

or the executive. 

64. The position of law summarized in the foregoing paragraph constitutes a 

declaration on the concept of the "basic structure", with reference to the concepts 

of "separation of powers", the "rule of law", and "judicial review". Based on the 

conclusions summarized above, it will be possible for us to answer the first issue 

projected before us, namely, whether "judicial review" is a part of the "basic 

structure" of the Constitution. The answer has inevitably to be in the affirmative. 

From the above determination, the petitioners would like us to further conclude, 

192 


Page 193 

that the power of "judicial review" stands breached with the promulgation of the 

NTT Act. This Court in Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra) held, that it should not be 

taken, that an effective alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement for 

"judicial review" could not be made by Parliament. The same position was 

reiterated in S.P. Sampath Kumar case (supra), namely, that "judicial review" 

was an integral part of the "basic structure" of the Constitution. All the same it 

was held, that Parliament was competent to amend the Constitution, and 

substitute in place of the High Court, another alternative institutional mechanism 

(court or tribunal). It would be pertinent to mention, that in so concluding, this 

Court added a forewarning, that the alternative institutional mechanism set up by 

Parliament through an amendment, had to be no less effective than the High 

Court itself. In L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), even though this Court held that 

the power of "judicial review" over legislative action vested in High Courts, was a 

part of the "basic structure", it went on to conclude that "ordinarily" the power of 

High Courts to test the constitutional validity of legislations could never be 

ousted. All the same it was held, that the powers vested in High Courts to 

exercise judicial superintendence over decisions of all courts and tribunals within 

their respective jurisdictions, was also a part of the "basic structure" of the 

Constitution. The position that Parliament had the power to amend the 

Constitution, and to create a court/tribunal to discharge functions which the High 

Court was discharging, was reiterated, in Union of India v. Madras Bar 

Association case (supra). It was concluded, that the Parliament was competent 

to enact a law, transferring the jurisdiction exercised by High Courts, in regard to 

193 


Page 194 

any specified subject, to any court/tribunal. But it was clarified, that Parliament 

could not transfer power vested in the High Courts, by the Constitution itself. We 

therefore have no hesitation in concluding, that appellate powers vested in the 

High Court under different statutory provisions, can definitely be transferred from 

the High Court to other courts/tribunals, subject to the satisfaction of norms 

declared by this Court. Herein the jurisdiction transferred by the NTT Act was 

with regard to specified subjects under tax related statutes. That, in our opinion, 

would be permissible in terms of the position expressed above. Has the NTT Act 

transferred any power vested in courts by the Constitution? The answer is in the 

negative. The power of "judicial review" vested in the High Court under Articles 

226 and 227 of the Constitution, has remained intact. This aspect of the matter, 

has a substantial bearing, to the issue in hand. And will also lead to some 

important inferences. Therefore, it must never be overlooked, that since the 

power of "judicial review" exercised by the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 

of the Constitution has remained unaltered, the power vested in High Courts to 

exercise judicial superintendence over the benches of the NTT within their 

respective jurisdiction, has been consciously preserved. 
This position was 

confirmed by the learned Attorney General for India, during the course of 

hearing. Since the above jurisdiction of the High Court has not been ousted, the 

NTT will be deemed to be discharging a supplemental role, rather than a 

substitutional role. In the above view of the matter, the submission that the NTT 

Act violates the "basic structure" of the Constitution, cannot be acquiesced to. 

194 


Page 195 

65. Even though we have declined to accept the contention advanced on 

behalf of the petitioners, premised on the "basic structure" theory, we feel it is still 

essential for us, to deal with the submission advanced on behalf of the 

respondents in response. We may first record the contention advanced on 

behalf of the respondents. It was contended, that a legislation (not being an 

amendment to the Constitution), enacted in consonance of the provisions of the 

Constitution, on a subject within the realm of the concerned legislature, cannot 

be assailed on the ground that it violates the "basic structure" of the Constitution. 

For the present controversy, the respondents had placed reliance on Articles 245 

and 246 of the Constitution, as also, on entries 77 to 79, 82 to 84, 95 and 97 of 

the Union List of the Seventh Schedule, and on entries 11A and 46 of the 

Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule. Based thereon it was asserted, that 

Parliament was competent to enact the NTT Act. For examining the instant 

contention, let us presume it is so. 
Having accepted the above, our 

consideration is as follows. 
The Constitution regulates the manner of 

governance in substantially minute detail. It is the fountainhead distributing 

power, for such governance. The Constitution vests the power of legislation at 

the Centre, with the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and in the States with the 

State Legislative Assemblies (and in some States, the State Legislative Councils, 

as well). The instant legislative power is regulated by "Part XI" of the 

Constitution. The submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for 

the respondents, insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, is 

premised on the assertion that the NTT Act has been enacted strictly in 

195 


Page 196 

consonance with the procedure depicted in "Part XI" of the Constitution. It is also 

the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the said power 

has been exercised strictly in consonance with the subject on which the 

Parliament is authorized to legislate. Whilst dealing with the instant submission 

advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, all that needs 

to be stated is, that the legislative power conferred under "Part XI" of the 

Constitution has one overall exception, which undoubtedly is, that the "basic 

structure" of the Constitution, cannot be infringed, no matter what. On the instant 

aspect, some relevant judgments, rendered by constitutional benches of this 

Court, have been cited hereinabove. It seems to us, that there is a fine 

difference in what the petitioners contend, and what the respondents seek to 

project. The submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the 

petitioners does not pertain to lack of jurisdiction or inappropriate exercise of 

jurisdiction. The submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for 

the petitioners pointedly is, that it is impermissible to legislate in a manner as 

would violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution. This Court has repeatedly 

held, that an amendment to the provisions of the Constitution, would not be 

sustainable if it violated the "basic structure" of the Constitution, even though the 

amendment had been carried out, by following the procedure contemplated 

under "Part XI" of the Constitution. This leads to the determination, that the 

"basic structure" is inviolable. In our view, the same would apply to all other 

legislations (other than amendments to the Constitution) as well, even though the 

legislation had been enacted by following the prescribed procedure, and was 

196 


Page 197 

within the domain of the enacting legislature, any infringement to the "basic 

structure" would be unacceptable. Such submissions advanced at the hands of 

the learned counsel for the respondents are, therefore, liable to be disallowed. 

And are accordingly declined. 

II. 
Whether the transfer of adjudicatory functions vested in the High Court to 
the NTT violates recognized constitutional conventions? 

III. 
Whether while transferring jurisdiction to a newly created court/tribunal, it is 
essential to maintain the standards and the stature of the court replaced? 

66. In addition to the determination on the adjudication of the present 

controversy on the concept of basic structure, the instant matter calls for a 

determination on the sustainability of the NTT Act, from other perspectives also. 

We shall now advert to the alternative contentions. First and foremost, it was the 

submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that it is impermissible for 

legislature to abrogate/divest the core judicial appellate functions, specially, the 

functions traditionally vested in a superior court, to a quasi judicial authority 

devoid of essential ingredients of the superior court. The instant submission was 

premised on the foundation, that such action is constitutionally impermissible. 

67. In order to determine whether or not the appellate functions which have 

now been vested with the NTT, constituted the core judicial appellate function 

traditionally vested with the jurisdictional High Courts, we have recorded under 

the heading -"The Historical Perspective", legislative details, pertaining to the 

Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act. We had to do so, for that 

was the only manner to deal with the instant aspect of the controversy. A perusal 

of the historical perspective reveals, that as against the initial assessment of 

197 


Page 198 

tax/duty liability, the first forum for challenge has traditionally been with an 

executive appellate adjudicatory authority. Legislative details reveal, that for 

some time there was a power of reference, exercisable on "questions of law". 

The adjudication thereof rested with the jurisdictional High Courts. The second 

appellate remedy has always been before a quasi-judicial appellate authority, 

styled as an Appellate Tribunal. Across the board, under all the enactments 

which are relevant for the present controversy, proceedings before the Appellate 

Tribunal have been legislatively described as "judicial proceedings". It is, 

therefore apparent, that right from the beginning, the clear legislative 

understanding was, that from the stage of the proceedings before the Appellate 

Tribunal, the proceedings were of the nature of "judicial proceedings". Again 

across the board, under all the enactments, relevant for the present controversy, 

questions of law were originally left to be adjudicated by the jurisdictional High 

Courts. The reference jurisdiction, was substituted in all the enactments, and 

converted into appellate jurisdiction. The instant appellate jurisdiction was 

vested with the jurisdictional High Court. Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, 

Section 260A, provided an appellate remedy from an order passed by the 

Appellate Tribunal, to the jurisdictional High Court. Similarly Section 129A of the 

Customs Act, 1962, and Section 35G of the Central Excise Act, 1944, provided 

for an appellate remedy from the concerned Appellate Tribunal to the High Court. 

The jurisdictional High Court would hear appeals on questions of law, against 

orders passed by the Appellate Tribunals. It is, therefore apparent, that right 

from the beginning, well before the promulgation of the Constitution, the core 

198

judicial appellate functions, for adjudication of tax related disputes, were vested 

with the jurisdictional High Courts. The High Courts have traditionally, been 

exercising the jurisdiction to determine questions of law, under all the above tax 

legislations. In this view of the matter, it is not possible for us to conclude, that it 

was not justified for the learned counsel for the petitioners to contend, that the 

core judicial appellate function in tax matters, on questions of law, has 

uninterruptedly been vested with the jurisdictional High Courts. 

68. Before we proceed with the matter further, it is necessary to keep in mind 

the composition of the adjudicatory authorities which have historically dealt with 

the matters arising out of tax laws. First, we shall deal with the composition of 

the Appellate Tribunals. All Appellate Tribunals which are relevant for the 

present controversy were essentially comprised of Judicial Members, besides 

Accountant or Technical Members. To qualify for appointment as a Judicial 

Member, it was essential that the incumbent had held a judicial office in India for 

a period of 10 years, or had practiced as an Advocate for a similar period. It is 

the above qualification, which enabled the enactments to provide, by a fiction of 

law, that all the said Appellate Tribunals were discharging "judicial proceedings". 

The next stage of appellate determination, has been traditionally vested with the 

High Courts. The income-tax legislation, the customs legislation, as well as, the 

central excise legislation uniformly provided, that in exercise of its appellate 

jurisdiction, the jurisdictional High Court would adjudicate appeals arising out of 

orders passed by the respective Appellate Tribunals. The said appeals were by 

a legislative determination, to be heard by benches comprising of at least two 

199 


Page 200 

judges of the High Court. Adjudication at the hands of a bench consisting of at 

least two judges, by itself is indicative of the legal complications, insofar as the 

appellate adjudicatory role, of the jurisdictional High Court was concerned. It 

would, therefore, not be incorrect to conclude, by accepting the submissions 

advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that before and 

after promulgation of the Constitution, till the enactment of the NTT Act, all 

legislative provisions vested the appellate power of adjudication, arising out of 

the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act, on questions of law, 

with the jurisdictional High Courts. 

69. Having recorded the above conclusion, the next issue to be determined is 

whether the adjudication of the disputes arising out of the provisions under 

reference, must remain within the realm of the jurisdictional High Courts? The 

instant proposition has two perspectives. 
Firstly, whether constitutional 

interpretation in the manner accepted the world over (details whereof have been 

narrated by us under the heading -"The Issues canvassed on behalf of the 

petitioners", under the sub-title -"The second contention"), would be a 

constitutional mandate, for the appellate jurisdiction pertaining to tax matters, to 

remain with the High Court? Secondly, whether the express provisions of the 

Constitution mandate, that tax issues should be decided by the concerned 

jurisdictional High Court? 

70. We shall first deal with the first perspective, namely, whether constitutional 

interpretation in the manner accepted the world over, would be a constitutional 

mandate for appellate jurisdiction on tax matters, to remain with the jurisdictional 

200 


Page 201 

High Court. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, reliance 

was placed on judgments emerging out of the Constitutions of Jamaica, Ceylon, 

Australia and Canada, rendered either by the Privy Council or the highest Courts 

of the concerned countries. The contention of the learned counsel for the 

petitioners was, that the constitutions of the above countries were based on the 

Westminster model. It was further pointed out, that the Indian Constitution was 

also based on the Westminster model, and that, the instant position stands 

recognized in the judgment rendered by this Court in Union of India v. Madras 

Bar Association case (supra). Incidentally, it may be mentioned that we have 

extracted paragraph 101 of the above judgment hereinabove, wherein it is so 

recorded. It is accordingly the contention of the learned counsel for the 

petitioners, that the judgments relied upon by the petitioners on the instant 

aspect of the matter, would be fully applicable to the controversy in hand. Under 

the constitutional convention, adverted to in the judgments referred to on behalf 

of the petitioners, it was submitted, that judicial power which rested with definite 

courts at the time of enactment of the constitutions based on the Westminster 

model, had to remain with the same courts, even after the constitutions had 

become effective and operational. Furthermore, it was submitted, that the 

judicial power had to be exercised in the same manner as before, i.e., whether by 

a judge sitting singly, or with other judges. And therefore it was asserted, that on 

constitutional conventions well recognized the world over, appellate jurisdiction in 

respect of tax matters, would have to remain with the jurisdictional High Courts, 

and would have to be determined by a bench of at least two judges of the High 

201 


Page 202 

Court, as was the position before the enactment of the Constitution, and, as has 

been the position thereafter, till the promulgation of the NTT Act. 

71. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submission advanced at 

the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners, insofar as the first 

perspective is concerned. We find substance in the submission advanced at the 

hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners, but not exactly in the format 

suggested by the learned counsel. A closer examination of the judgments relied 

upon lead us to the conclusion, that in every new constitution, which makes 

separate provisions for the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, it is taken 

as acknowledged/conceded, that the basic principle of "separation of powers" 

would apply. And that, the three wings of governance would operate in their 

assigned domain/province. The power of discharging judicial functions, which 

was exercised by members of the higher judiciary, at the time when the 

constitution came into force, should ordinarily remain with the court, which 

exercised the said jurisdiction, at the time of promulgation of the new constitution. 

But the judicial power could be allowed to be exercised by an analogous/similar 

court/tribunal, with a different name. However, by virtue of the constitutional 

convention, while constituting the analogous court/tribunal, it will have to be 

ensured, that the appointment and security of tenure of judges of that court would 

be the same, as of the court sought to be substituted. This was the express 

conclusion drawn in Hinds case (supra). In Hinds case it was acknowledged, 

that Parliament was not precluded from establishing a court under a new name, 

to exercise the jurisdiction that was being exercised by members of the higher 

202 


Page 203 

judiciary, at the time when the constitution came into force. But when that was 

done, it was critical to ensure, that the persons appointed to be members of such 

a court/tribunal, should be appointed in the same manner, and should be entitled 

to the same security of tenure, as the holder of the judicial office, at the time 

when the constitution came into force. Even in the treatise "Constitutional Law of 

Canada" by Peter W. Hogg, it was observed; if a province invested a tribunal with 

a jurisdiction of a kind, which ought to properly belong to a superior, district or 

county Court, then that court/tribunal (created in its place), whatever is its official 

name, for constitutional purposes has to, while replacing a superior, district or 

county Court, satisfy the requirements and standards of the substituted court. 

This would mean, that the newly constituted court/tribunal will be deemed to be 

invalidly constituted, till its members are appointed in the same manner, and till 

its members are entitled to the same conditions of service, as were available to 

the judges of the court sought to be substituted. In the judgments under 

reference it has also been concluded, that a breach of the above constitutional 

convention could not be excused by good intention (by which the legislative 

power had been exercised, to enact a given law). We are satisfied, that the 

aforesaid exposition of law, is in consonance with the position expressed by this 

Court, while dealing with the concepts of "separation of powers", the "rule of law" 

and "judicial review". In this behalf, reference may be made to the judgments in 

L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), as also, in Union of India v. Madras Bar 

Association case (supra). Therein, this Court has recognized, that transfer of 

jurisdiction is permissible, but in effecting such transfer, the court to which the 

203 


Page 204 

power of adjudication is transferred, must be endured with salient characteristics, 

which were possessed by the court from which the adjudicatory power has been 

transferred. In recording our conclusions on the submission advanced as the 

first perspective, we may only state, that our conclusion is exactly the same as 

was drawn by us while examining the petitioners' previous submission, namely, 

that it is not possible for us to accept, that under recognized constitutional 

conventions, judicial power vested in superior courts cannot be transferred to 

coordinate courts/tribunals. The answer is, that such transfer is permissible. But 

whenever there is such transfer, all conventions/customs/practices of the court 

sought to be replaced, have to be incorporated in the court/tribunal created. The 

newly created court/tribunal would have to be established, in consonance with 

the salient characteristics and standards of the court which is sought to be 

substituted. 

72. Now we shall deal with the second perspective, namely, whether the 

provisions of the Indian Constitution itself mandate, that tax issues at the 

appellate level, must be heard by the concerned jurisdictional High Court. 

Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, learned counsel for the 

petitioners placed reliance on Articles 50 and 225 of the Constitution. Article 50 

of the Constitution was relied upon to demonstrate the intent of the framers of the 

Constitution, namely, that they wished to ensure the exclusivity and the 

separation of the judiciary, from the executive. It is not necessary for us to deal 

with the instant aspect of the matter, for the reason that, in the judgments 

204 


Page 205 

rendered by this Court which have been referred to by us hereinabove, the issue 

has already been debated with reference to Article 50 of the Constitution. 

73. The other provision relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners is 

Article 225 of the Constitution. The tenor of the submission advanced by the 

learned counsel for the petitioners, has been recorded by us while dealing with 

the second contention (advanced on behalf of the petitioners). The same may be 

adverted to. There can be no doubt whatsoever, that Article 225 of the 

Constitution does expressly provide, that the jurisdiction of existing High Courts 

and the respective powers of the judges thereof "shall be the same as 

immediately before the commencement of the Constitution". It is also apparent, 

that the proviso thereto expressly mandates, "that any restriction to which the 

exercise of original jurisdiction by any of the High Courts with respect to any 

matter concerning the revenue or concerning any act ordered or done in 

collection thereof was subject immediately before the commencement of the 

Constitution shall no longer apply to the exercise of such jurisdiction". Insofar as 

the contention emerging out of the proviso is concerned, it needs to be pointed 

out, that the same pertains to "the exercise of original jurisdiction by any of the 

High Courts". It is, therefore apparent, that the issue in hand, namely, the 

appellate jurisdiction vested with the jurisdictional High Courts, under the 

provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act, has no 

bearing to the proviso under reference. We may therefore conclude by 

recording, that the instant submission advanced on behalf of the petitioners, is 

not made out from Article 225 of the Constitution. 

205

IV. 
Whether Company Secretaries should be allowed to appear before the 
NTT to represent a party to an appeal in the same fashion, and on parity with, 
Accountants? 

V. 
Whether Section 13(1) of the NTT Act insofar as it allows Accountants to 
represent a party to an appeal before the NTT is valid? 

74. We may first take up for consideration, Writ Petition (Civil) no. 621 of 2007. 

The same has been filed by members of the Institute of Company Secretaries of 

India, seeking the right to appear before the NTT, as representatives of a party to 

an appeal. Respondent no. 5 in the said Writ Petition, is the Institute of 

Chartered Accountants. It has entered appearance and canvassed that the claim 

of Company Secretaries and Chartered Accountants is not comparable. While 

indicating the permissibility of Chartered Accountants to represent a party to an 

appeal before the NTT on account of their special acumen, their claim is, that this 

issue raised on behalf of the Company Secretaries is a matter of policy. And 

therefore, it would not be open to this Court to bestow, on account of parity, the 

right to represent a party to an appeal, before the NTT, on Company Secretaries. 

75. While examining the above contention, we will indeed be dealing with 

Section 13 of the NTT Act, which has already been extracted while recording the 

submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, with reference to the fourth 

contention. A perusal of the said provision reveals, that a party to an appeal 

(other than the Revenue) may appear either in person, or may authorize one or 

more Chartered Accountants, or legal practitioners, or any person duly 

authorized by him, to present his case before the NTT. The pointed submission 

advanced on behalf of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was, that 

under Section 13 of the NTT Act, Chartered Accountants are entitled to appear 

206 


Page 207 

before the NTT, because of their recognized acumen. It was submitted, that it is 

the prerogative of the legislature and a matter of policy, to determine persons 

who are entitled to appear before the NTT. It was pointed out, that courts should 

not ordinarily interfere in such policy matters. It is therefore, that learned counsel 

for the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, has placed reliance on the 

decision rendered by this Court in Delhi Pradesh Registered Medical 

Practitioners v. Director of Health, Delhi Administration Services, (1997) 11 SCC 

687, wherefrom our pointed attention was invited to the following observations:-

"2. 
The propriety and validity of the public notice issued by the Director, 
Health Services, Delhi Administration indicating that the Indian Medicine 
Central Council had recognized Ayurveda Ratna and Vaid Visharada 
degrees awarded by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag, Allahabad only 
up to 1967 and the certificate of Ayurveda Ratna and Vaid Visharada given 
by the said organization after 1967 not being recognized under the said 
Act, registration obtained by any person as a medical practitioner on the 
basis of such degrees therefore would not be recognized and any person 
having such qualification would not be entitled to practise in Delhi are 
impugned in these appeals. It was also indicated in the said public notice 
that no Indian university or Board conducts one year's course for giving the 
bachelor's degree in Ayurvedic Medicine or through correspondence 
course no M.D. Degree in Ayurveda was conferred by any university or 
Board. The public at large was cautioned by the said public notice 
published in the newspaper about such position in law. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
5. 
We are, however, unable to accept such contention of Mr. Mehta. 
Sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 
1970, in our view, only envisages that where before the enactment of the 
said Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970 on the basis of requisite 
qualification which was then recognized, a person got himself registered as 
medical practitioner in the disciplines contemplated under the said Act or in 
the absence of any requirement for registration such person had been 
practising for five years or intended to be registered and was also entitled 
to be registered, the right of such person to practise in the discipline 
concerned including the privileges of a registered medical practitioner 
stood protected even though such practitioner did not possess requisite 
qualification under the said Act of 1970. It may be indicated that such view 
of ours is reflected from the Objects and Reasons indicated for introducing 

207 


Page 208 

sub-section (3) of Section 17 in the Act. In the Objects and Reasons, it was 
mentioned: 
"[T]he Committee are of the opinion that the existing rights and 
privileges of practitioners of Indian Medicine should be given 
adequate safeguards. The Committee, in order to achieve this 
object, have added three new paragraphs to sub-section (3) of the 
clause protecting (i) the rights to practise of those practitioners of 
Indian Medicine who may not, under the proposed legislation, 
possess a recognized qualification subject to the condition that they 
are already enrolled on a State Register of Indian Medicine on the 
date of commencement of this Act, (ii) the privileges conferred on 
the practitioners of Indian Medicine enrolled on a State Register, 
under any law in force in that State, and (iii) the right to practise in a 
State of those practitioners who have been practising Indian 
Medicine in that State for not less than five years where no register 
of Indian Medicine was maintained earlier." 
As it is not the case of any of the writ petitioners that they had 
acquired the degree in between 1957 (sic 1967) and 1970 or on the date of 
enforcement of provisions of Section 17(2) of the said Act and got 
themselves registered or acquired right to be registered, there is no 
question of getting the protection under sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the 
said Act. It is to be stated here that there is also no challenge as to the 
validity of the said Central Act, 1970. The decision of the Delhi High Court 
therefore cannot be assailed by the appellants. We may indicate here that 
it has been submitted by Mr. Mehta and also by Ms. Sona Khan appearing 
in the appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition No. 6167 of 1993 that 
proper consideration had not been given to the standard of education 
imparted by the said Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag and expertise 
acquired by the holders of the aforesaid degrees awarded by the said 
institution. In any event, when proper medical facilities have not been 
made available to a large number of poorer sections of the society, the ban 
imposed on the practitioners like the writ petitioners rendering useful 
service to the needy and poor people was wholly unjustified. It is not 
necessary for this Court to consider such submissions because the same 
remains in the realm of policy decision of other constitutional functionaries. 
We may also indicate here that what constitutes proper education and 
requisite expertise for a practitioner in Indian Medicine, must be left to the 
proper authority having requisite knowledge in the subject. As the decision 
of the Delhi High Court is justified on the face of legal position flowing from 
the said Central Act of 1970, we do not think that any interference by this 
Court is called for. These appeals therefore are dismissed without any 
order as to costs." 

208 


Page 209 

Reliance was also placed on State of Rajasthan v. Lata Arun, (2002) 6 SCC 252, 

wherein it was held as under:-

"4. 
The question which arises for determination in this case is whether 
the respondent had the eligibility qualification for admission in General 
Nursing and Midwifery and Staff Nurse Course (hereinafter referred to as 
"Nursing Course") commencing in the year 1990. The Director, Medical 
and Health Services had invited applications by 15-12-1989 from eligible 
candidates for admission in the Nursing Course to be started from January 
1990. It was stated in the notification that the candidates should have 
passed first year of three years' degree course (TDC) or 10+2; and that the 
candidates with Science subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) will be 
given preference. During the period, the Indian Nursing Council had issued 
a set of Syllabi and Regulations for courses in General Nursing and 
Midwifery in which the prescribed minimum educational qualification for all 
candidates was 12th class-pass or its equivalent preferably with Science 
subjects. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
10. The points involved in the case are twofold: one relating to prescription 
of minimum educational qualification for admission to the course and the 
other relating to recognition of the Madhyama Certificate issued by the 
Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad as equivalent to or higher than +2 or 
1st year of TDC for the purpose of admission. Both these points relate to 
matters in the realm of policy decision to be taken by the State 
Government or the authority vested with power under any statute. It is not 
for courts to determine whether a particular educational qualification 
possessed by a candidate should or should not be recognized as 
equivalent to the prescribed qualification in the case. That is not to say that 
such matters are not justiciable. In an appropriate case the court can 
examine whether the policy decision or the administrative order dealing 
with the matter is based on a fair, rational and reasonable ground; whether 
the decision has been taken on consideration of relevant aspects of the 
matter; whether exercise of the power is obtained with mala fide intention; 
whether the decision serves the purpose of giving proper training to the 
candidates admitted or it is based on irrelevant and irrational 
considerations or intended to benefit an individual or a group of 
candidates." 

76. In addition to the above submissions it was contended, that the Chartered 

Accountants are permitted to appear before a large number of tribunals/fora. 

Illustratively it was submitted, that under Section 288 of the Income Tax Act, 

1961, read with Rule 50 of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Chartered Accountants 

209 


Page 210 

are permitted to appear in income tax matters. Likewise, it was asserted that 

Chartered Accountants are entitled to appear in Central Excise matters under 

Section 35Q of the Central Excise Act, 1944. They are also permitted to appear 

in matters arising out of the Customs Act, 1962 (wherefor reliance was placed on 

Section 146A of the Customs Act, 1962, read with Rule 9(a), Customs (Appeals) 

Rules, 1982). Besides the aforesaid provisions, it was contended, that Chartered 

Accountants were entitled to appear before various tribunals/fora under different 

statutory provisions, such as, under the Securities and Exchange Board of India 

Act, 1992, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Telecom 

Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1991, the Companies Act, 2013, the Company 

Law Board Regulations, 1991, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007, and the 

Special Economic Zone Rules, 2006. We were informed, that Chartered 

Accountants were also entitled to appear before the Central Electricity 

Regulatory Commission vide Notification dated 27.8.1999. It was submitted, that 

if Chartered Accountants are competent to canvass complicated disputes which 

arise under the provisions referred to hereinabove, there should be no difficulty in 

allowing them to appear before the NTT, as also, to consider them eligible for 

being appointed as Members of the NTT. It was therefore asserted, that Section 

13 of the NTT Act rightly permitted Chartered Accountants to represent a party to 

an appeal before the NTT. The submission on behalf of the Institute of 

Chartered Accountants was, that Company Secretaries were not comparable 

with them, and therefore, as a matter of policy, they had no legitimate claim for 

being allowed to represent a party before the NTT. 

210 


Page 211 

77. It is pertinent to record, that during the course of hearing we had required 

learned counsel representing the petitioners, to file a compilation of cases, 

wherein provisions of different laws on diverse subjects had to be taken into 

consideration, while deciding tax related disputes. In compliance, learned 

counsel have submitted a compilation on behalf of the Madras Bar Association 

(in Transferred Case (Civil) no. 150 of 2006), tabulating by way of illustration, 

reported cases on tax disputes, which also involved provisions of different laws 

on different subjects. The compilation brought to our notice is summarized

4 Bacha F. Guzdar 
v. C.I.T. 
AIR 1955 SC 74 

(i) Partnership is merely an association of persons for 
carrying on the business of partnership and, in law, the firm 
name is a compendious method of describing the partners. 
Such is, however, not the case of a company which stands 
as a separate juristic entity distinct from the shareholders. 
(ii) Shareholders have no right in the property of the 
company. They are only entitled to dividends and a share in 
the surplus, if any, after the dissolution of the company.

It is apparent from the compilation extracted hereinabove, that the Members of 

the NTT would most definitely be confronted with the legal issues emerging out 

of Family Law, Hindu Law, Mohammedan Law, Company Law, Law of 

Partnership, Law related to Territoriality, Law related to Trusts and Societies, 

Contract Law, Law relating to Transfer of Property, Law relating to Intellectual 

Property, Interpretation of Statutes, and other Miscellaneous Provisions of Law, 

from time to time. The NTT besides the aforesaid statutes, will not only have to 

interpret the provisions of the three statutes, out of which appeals will be heard 

by it, but will also have to examine a challenge to the vires of statutory 

amendments made in the said provisions, from time to time. They will also have 

to determine in some cases, whether the provisions relied upon had a 

prospective or retrospective applicability. 

78. Keeping in mind the fact, that in terms of Section 15 of the NTT Act, the 

NTT would hear appeals from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the 

Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) only on 

"substantial questions of law", it is difficult for us to appreciate the propriety of 

representation, on behalf of a party to an appeal, through either Chartered 

Accountants or Company Secretaries, before the NTT. The determination at the 

hands of the NTT is shorn of factual disputes. It has to decide only "substantial 

questions of law". In our understanding, Chartered Accountants and Company 

Secretaries would at best be specialists in understanding and explaining issues 

pertaining to accounts. These issues would, fall purely within the realm of facts. 

We find it difficult to accept the prayer made by the Company Secretaries to 

223 


Page 224 

allow them, to represent a party to an appeal before the NTT. Even insofar as 

the Chartered Accountants are concerned, we are constrained to hold that 

allowing them to appear on behalf of a party before the NTT, would be 

unacceptable in law. We accordingly reject the claim of Company Secretaries, to 

represent a party before the NTT. Accordingly the prayer made by Company 

Secretaries in Writ Petition (Civil) no. 621 of 2007 is hereby declined. While 

recording the above conclusion, we simultaneously hold Section 13(1), insofar as 

it allows Chartered Accountants to represent a party to an appeal before the 

NTT, as unconstitutional and unsustainable in law. 

VI. The constitutional validity of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 of the NTT Act: 

79. We shall now endeavour to deal with the validity of some other individual 

provisions of the NTT Act, based on the parameters laid down by constitutional 

benches of this Court and on the basis of recognized constitutional conventions 

referable to constitutions framed on the Westminster model. While dealing with 

the prayers made in Writ Petition (Civil) no. 621 of 2007, we have already dealt 

with Section 13 of the NTT Act, and have held, the same to be partly 

unconstitutional. We shall now proceed chronologically, and examine the validity 

of Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the NTT Act. 

80. We shall first examine the validity of Section 5 of the NTT Act. The basis 

of challenge to the above provision, has already been narrated by us while 

dealing with the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, with 

reference to the fourth contention. According to the learned counsel for the 

224 


Page 225 

petitioners, Section 5(2) of the NTT Act mandates, that the NTT would ordinarily 

have its sittings in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. According to the 

petitioners, the aforesaid mandate would deprive the litigating assessee, the 

convenience of approaching the jurisdictional High Court in the State, to which he 

belongs. An assessee may belong to a distant/remote State, in which 

eventuality, he would not merely have to suffer the hardship of traveling a long 

distance, but such travel would also entail uncalled for financial expense. 

Likewise, a litigant assessee from a far-flung State may find it extremely difficult 

and inconvenient to identify an Advocate who would represent him before the 

NTT, since the same is mandated to be ordinarily located in the National Capital 

Territory of Delhi. Even though we have expressed the view, that it is open to the 

Parliament to substitute the appellate jurisdiction vested in the jurisdictional High 

Courts and constitute courts/tribunals to exercise the said jurisdiction, we are of 

the view, that while vesting jurisdiction in an alternative court/tribunal, it is 

imperative for the legislature to ensure, that redress should be available, with the 

same convenience and expediency, as it was prior to the introduction of the 

newly created court/tribunal. Thus viewed, the mandate incorporated in Section 

5(2) of the NTT Act to the effect that the sittings of the NTT would ordinarily be 

conducted in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, would render the remedy 

inefficacious, and thus unacceptable in law. The instant aspect of the matter was 

considered by this Court with reference to the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, 

in S.P. Sampath Kumar case (supra) and L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), 

wherein it was held, that permanent benches needed to be established at the 

225 


Page 226 

seat of every jurisdictional High Court. And if that was not possible, at least a 

circuit bench required to be established at every place where an aggrieved party 

could avail of his remedy. The position on the above issue, is no different in the 

present controversy. For the above reason, Section 5(2) of the NTT Act is in 

clear breach of the law declared by this Court. 

81. One needs to also examine sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Section 5 

of the NTT Act, with pointed reference to the role of the Central Government in 

determining the sitting of benches of the NTT. The Central Government has 

been authorized to notify the area in relation to which each bench would exercise 

jurisdiction, to determine the constitution of the benches, and finally, to exercise 

the power of transfer of Members of one bench to another bench. One cannot 

lose sight of the fact, that the Central Government will be a stakeholder in each 

and every appeal/case, which would be filed before the NTT. It cannot, 

therefore, be appropriate to allow the Central Government to play any role, with 

reference to the places where the benches would be set up, the areas over which 

the benches would exercise jurisdiction, the composition and the constitution of 

the benches, as also, the transfer of the Members from one bench to another. It 

would be inappropriate for the Central Government, to have any administrative 

dealings with the NTT or its Members. In the jurisdictional High Courts, such 

power is exercised exclusively by the Chief Justice, in the best interest of the 

administration of justice. Allowing the Central Government to participate in the 

aforestated administrative functioning of the NTT, in our view, would impinge 

upon the independence and fairness of the Members of the NTT. For the NTT 

226 


Page 227 

Act to be valid, the Chairperson and Members of the NTT should be possessed 

of the same independence and security, as the judges of the jurisdictional High 

Courts (which the NTT is mandated to substitute). Vesting of the power of 

determining the jurisdiction, and the postings of different Members, with the 

Central Government, in our considered view, would undermine the independence 

and fairness of the Chairperson and the Members of the NTT, as they would 

always be worried to preserve their jurisdiction based on their 

preferences/inclinations in terms of work, and conveniences in terms of place of 

posting. An unsuitable/disadvantageous Chairperson or Member could be easily 

moved to an insignificant jurisdiction, or to an inconvenient posting. This could 

be done to chastise him, to accept a position he would not voluntarily accede to. 

We are, therefore of the considered view, that Section 5 of the NTT Act is not 

sustainable in law, as it does not ensure that the alternative adjudicatory 

authority, is totally insulated from all forms of interference, pressure or influence 

from co-ordinate branches of Government. There is therefore no alternative, but 

to hold that sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Section 5 of the NTT Act are 

unconstitutional. 

82. We shall now examine the validity of Section 6 of the NTT Act. The above 

provision has already been extracted in an earlier part of this judgment, while 

dealing with the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, with 

reference to the fourth contention. A perusal of Section 6 reveals, that a person 

would be qualified for appointment as a Member, if he is or has been a Member 

of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal or of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax 

227 


Page 228 

Appellate Tribunal for at least 5 years. While dealing with the historical 

perspective, with reference to the Income Tax legislation, the Customs 

legislation, as also, the Central Excise legislation, we have noticed the eligibility 

of those who can be appointed as Members of the Appellate Tribunals 

constituted under the aforesaid legislations. Under the Income Tax Act, a person 

who has practiced in accountancy as a Chartered Accountant (under the 

Chartered Accountants Act, 1949) for a period of 10 years, or has been a 

Registered Accountant (or partly a Registered Accountant, and partly a 

Chartered Accountant) for a period of 10 years, is eligible to be appointed as an 

Accountant Member. Under the Customs Act and the Excise Act, a person who 

has been a member of the Indian Customs and Central Excise Service (Group 

A), subject to the condition, that such person has held the post of Collector of 

Customs or Central Excise (Level I), or equivalent or higher post, for at least 3 

years, is eligible to be appointed as a Technical Member. It is apparent from the 

narration recorded hereinabove, that persons with the above qualifications, who 

were appointed as Accountant Members or Technical Members in the respective 

Appellate Tribunals, are also eligible for appointment as Members of the NTT, 

subject to their having rendered specified years' service as such. The question 

to be determined is, whether persons with the aforesaid qualifications, satisfy the 

parameters of law declared by this Court, to be appointed as, Members of the 

NTT? And do they satisfy the recognized constitutional conventions? 

83. This Court has declared the position in this behalf in L. Chandra Kumar 

case (supra) and in Union of India v. Madras Bar Association case (supra), that 

228 


Page 229 

Technical Members could be appointed to the tribunals, where technical 

expertise is essential for disposal of matters, and not otherwise. It has also been 

held, that where the adjudicatory process transferred to a tribunal does not 

involve any specialized skill, knowledge or expertise, a provision for appointment 

of non-Judicial Members (in addition to, or in substitution of Judicial Members), 

would constitute a clear case of delusion and encroachment upon the 

"independence of judiciary", and the "rule of law". It is difficult to appreciate how 

Accountant Members and Technical Members would handle complicated 

questions of law relating to tax matters, and also questions of law on a variety of 

subjects (unconnected to tax), in exercise of the jurisdiction vested with the NTT. 

That in our view would be a tall order. An arduous and intimidating asking. 

Since the Chairperson/Members of the NTT will be required to determine 

"substantial questions of law", arising out of decisions of the Appellate Tribunals, 

it is difficult to appreciate how an individual, well-versed only in accounts, would 

be able to discharge such functions. Likewise, it is also difficult for us to 

understand how Technical Members, who may not even possess the qualification 

of law, or may have no experience at all in the practice of law, would be able to 

deal with "substantial questions of law", for which alone, the NTT has been 

constituted. 

84. We have already noticed hereinabove, from data placed on record by the 

learned counsel for the petitioners, that the NTT would be confronted with 

disputes arising out of Family Law, Hindu Law, Mohemmedan Law, Company 

Law, Law of Partnership, Law relating to Territoriality, Law relating to Trusts and 

229 


Page 230 

Societies, Contract Law, Law relating to Transfer of Property, Law relating to 

Intellectual Property, Interpretation of Statutes/Rules, and other Miscellaneous 

Provisions of Law. Besides the above, the Members of the NTT will regularly 

have to interpret the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the 

Excise Act. We are of the considered opinion, that only a person possessing 

professional qualification in law, with substantial experience in the practice of 

law, will be in a position to handle the onerous responsibilities which a 

Chairperson and Members of the NTT will have to shoulder. 

85. There seems to be no doubt, whatsoever, that the Members of a 

court/tribunal to which adjudicatory functions are transferred, must be manned by 

judges/members whose stature and qualifications are commensurate to the court 

from which the adjudicatory process has been transferred. This position is 

recognized the world over. Constitutional conventions in respect of Jamaica, 

Ceylon, Australia and Canada, on this aspect of the matter have been delineated 

above. The opinion of the Privy Council expressed by Lord Diplock in Hind case 

(supra), has been shown as being followed in countries which have constitutions 

on the Westminster model. The Indian Constitution is one such Constitution. 

The position has been clearly recorded while interpreting constitutions framed on 

the above model, namely, that even though the legislature can transfer judicial 

power from a traditional court, to an analogous court/tribunal with a different 

name, the court/tribunal to which such power is transferred, should be possessed 

of the same salient characteristics, standards and parameters, as the court the 

power whereof was being transferred. It is not possible for us to accept, that 

230 


Page 231 

Accountant Members and Technical Members have the stature and qualification 

possessed by judges of High Courts. 

86. It was not disputed, that the NTT has been created to handle matters 

which were earlier within the appellate purview of the jurisdictional High Courts. 

We are accordingly satisfied, that the appointment of Accountant Members and 

Technical Members of the Appellate Tribunals to the NTT, would be in clear 

violation of the constitutional conventions recognized by courts, the world over. 

References on questions of law (under the three legislative enactments in 

question), were by a legislative mandate, required to be adjudicated by a bench 

of at least two judges of the jurisdictional High Court. When the remedy of 

reference (before the High Court) was converted into an appellate remedy (under 

the three legislative enactments in question), again by a legislative mandate, the 

appeal was to be heard by a bench of at least two judges, of the jurisdictional 

High Court. One cannot lose sight of the fact, that hitherto before, the issues 

which will vest in the jurisdiction of the NTT, were being decided by a bench of at 

least two judges of the High Court. The onerous and complicated nature of the 

adjudicatory process is clear. We may also simultaneously notice, that the power 

of "judicial review" vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the 

Constitution has not been expressly taken away by the NTT Act. During the 

course of hearing, we had expressed our opinion in respect of the power of 

"judicial review" vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the 

Constitution. In our view, the power stood denuded, on account of the fact that, 

Section 24 of the NTT Act vested with an aggrieved party, a remedy of appeal 

231 


Page 232 

against an order passed by the NTT, directly to the Supreme Court. Section 24 

aforementioned is being extracted hereunder: 

"24. Appeal to Supreme Court.-Any person including any department of 
the Government aggrieved by any decision or order of the National Tax 
Tribunal may file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from 
the date of communication of the decision or order of the National Tax 
Tribunal to him: 

Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the appellant 
was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the said 
period, allow it to be filed within such time as it may deem fit." 

In view of the aforestated appellate remedy, from an order passed by the NTT 

directly to the Supreme Court, there would hardly be any occasion, to raise a 

challenge on a tax matter, arising out of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the 

Customs Act and the Excise Act, before a jurisdictional High Court. Even though 

the learned Attorney General pointed out, that the power of "judicial review" 

under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution had not been taken away, yet he 

acknowledged, that there would be implicit limitations where such power would 

be exercisable. Therefore, all the more, the composition of the NTT would have 

to be on the same parameters as judges of the High Courts. Since the 

appointments of the Chairperson/Members of the NTT are not on the parameters 

expressed hereinabove, the same are unsustainable under the declared law. A 

perusal of Section 6 of the NTT Act leaves no room for any doubt, that none of 

the above parameters is satisfied insofar as the appointment of Chairperson and 

other Members of the NTT is concerned. In the above view of the matter, 

Section 6(2)(b) of the NTT Act is liable to be declared unconstitutional. We 

declare it to be so. 

232 


Page 233 

87. We would now deal with the submissions advanced by the learned counsel 

for the petitioners in respect of Section 7 of the NTT Act. It seems to us, that 

Section 7 has been styled in terms of the decision rendered by this Court in L. 

Chandra Kumar case (supra). Following the above judgment for determining the 

manner of selection of the Chairperson and Members of the NTT, is obviously a 

clear misunderstanding of the legal position declared by this Court. It should not 

have been forgotten, that under the provisions of the Administrative Tribunals 

Act, 1985, which came up for consideration in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), 

the tribunals constituted under the said Act, are to act like courts of first instance. 

All decisions of the tribunal are amenable to challenge under Articles 226/227 of 

the Constitution before, a division bench of the jurisdictional High Court. In such 

circumstances it is apparent, that tribunals under the Administrative Tribunals 

Act, 1985, were subservient to the jurisdictional High Courts. The manner of 

selection, as suggested in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra) cannot therefore be 

adopted for a tribunal of the nature as the NTT. Herein the acknowledged 

position is, that the NTT has been constituted as a replacement of High Courts. 

The NTT is, therefore, in the real sense a tribunal substituting the High Courts. 

The manner of appointment of Chairperson/Members to the NTT will have to be, 

by the same procedure (or by a similar procedure), to that which is prevalent for 

appointment of judges of High Courts. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter 

is concerned, the above proposition was declared by this Court in Union of India 

v. Madras Bar Association case (supra), wherein it was held, that the stature of 

the Members who would constitute the tribunal, would depend on the jurisdiction 

233 


Page 234 

which was being transferred to the tribunal. Accordingly, if the jurisdiction of the 

High Courts is being transferred to the NTT, the stature of the Members of the 

tribunal had to be akin to that of the judges of High Courts. So also the 

conditions of service of its Chairperson/Members. And the manner of their 

appointment and removal, including transfers. Including, the tenure of their 

appointments. 

88. Section 7 cannot even otherwise, be considered to be constitutionally 

valid, since it includes in the process of selection and appointment of the 

Chairperson and Members of the NTT, Secretaries of Departments of the Central 

Government. In this behalf, it would also be pertinent to mention, that the 

interests of the Central Government would be represented on one side, in every 

litigation before the NTT. It is not possible to accept a party to a litigation, can 

participate in the selection process, whereby the Chairperson and Members of 

the adjudicatory body are selected. This would also be violative of the 

recognized constitutional convention recorded by Lord Diplock in Hinds case 

(supra), namely, that it would make a mockery of the constitution, if the 

legislature could transfer the jurisdiction previously exercisable by holders of 

judicial offices, to holders of a new court/tribunal (to which some different name 

was attached) and to provide that persons holding the new judicial offices, should 

not be appointed in the manner and on the terms prescribed for appointment of 

Members of the judicature. For all the reasons recorded hereinabove, we hereby 

declare Section 7 of the NTT Act, as unconstitutional. 

234 


Page 235 

89. Insofar as the validity of Section 8 of the NTT Act is concerned, it clearly 

emerges from a perusal thereof, that a Chairperson/Member is appointed to the 

NTT, in the first instance, for a duration of 5 years. Such Chairperson/Member is 

eligible for reappointment, for a further period of 5 years. We have no hesitation 

to accept the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the 

petitioners, that a provision for reappointment would itself have the effect of 

undermining the independence of the Chairperson/Members of the NTT. Every 

Chairperson/Member appointed to the NTT, would be constrained to decide 

matters, in a manner that would ensure his reappointment in terms of Section 8 

of the NTT Act. His decisions may or may not be based on his independent 

understanding. We are satisfied, that the above provision would undermine the 

independence and fairness of the Chairperson and Members of the NTT. Since 

the NTT has been vested with jurisdiction which earlier lay with the High Courts, 

in all matters of appointment, and extension of tenure, must be shielded from 

executive involvement. The reasons for our instant conclusions are exactly the 

same as have been expressed by us while dealing with Section 5 of the NTT Act. 

We therefore hold, that Section 8 of the NTT Act is unconstitutional. 

90. Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 of the NTT Act have been held by us (to the 

extent indicated hereinabove) to be illegal and unconstitutional on the basis of 

the parameters laid down by decisions of constitutional benches of this Court and 

on the basis of recognized constitutional conventions referable to constitutions 

framed on the Westminster model. In the absence of the aforesaid provisions 

which have been held to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions have been 

235 


Page 236 

rendered otiose and worthless, and as such, the provisions of the NTT Act, as a 

whole, are hereby set aside. 

Conclusions: 

91 (i) The Parliament has the power to enact legislation, and to vest adjudicatory 

functions, earlier vested in the High Court, with an alternative court/tribunal. 

Exercise of such power by the Parliament would not per se violate the "basic 

structure" of the Constitution. 

(ii) 
Recognized constitutional conventions pertaining to the Westminster 

model, do not debar the legislating authority from enacting legislation to vest 

adjudicatory functions, earlier vested in a superior court, with an alternative 

court/tribunal. Exercise of such power by the Parliament would per se not violate 

any constitutional convention. 

(iii) The "basic structure" of the Constitution will stand violated, if while 

enacting legislation pertaining to transfer of judicial power, Parliament does not 

ensure, that the newly created court/tribunal, conforms with the salient 

characteristics and standards, of the court sought to be substituted. 

(iv) Constitutional conventions, pertaining to constitutions styled on the 

Westminster model, will also stand breached, if while enacting legislation, 

pertaining to transfer of judicial power, conventions and salient characteristics of 

the court sought to be replaced, are not incorporated in the court/tribunal sought 

to be created. 

236 


Page 237 

(v) 
The prayer made in Writ Petition (C) No.621 of 2007 is declined. Company 

Secretaries are held ineligible, for representing a party to an appeal before the 

NTT. 

(vi) Examined on the touchstone of conclusions (iii) and (iv) above, Sections 5, 

6, 7, 8 and 13 of the NTT Act (to the extent indicated hereinabove), are held to 

be unconstitutional. Since the aforesaid provisions, constitute the edifice of the 

NTT Act, and without these provisions the remaining provisions are rendered 

ineffective and inconsequential, the entire enactment is declared unconstitutional.

1. 
In these cases, essentially four contentions have been urged on behalf 

of the petitioners. The first contention is that the reason for setting up a 

National Tax Tribunal is non-existent as uniformity of decisions pertaining to 

tax laws is hardly a reason for interposing another tribunal between an 

appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court, as High Court decisions are more 

or less uniform, since they follow the law laid down by each other. Since this 

is so, the Act must be struck down. The second contention is that it is 

238 


Page 239 

impermissible for the legislature to divest superior courts of record from the 

core judicial function of deciding substantial questions of law. The third 

contention is as regards the Constitutional validity of Article 323-B being 

violative of the separation of powers doctrine, the rule of law doctrine and 

judicial review. The fourth contention concerns itself with the nitty gritty of 

the Act, namely, that various sections undermine the independence of the 

adjudicatory process and cannot stand judicial scrutiny in their present form. 

Since I am accepting the second contention urged by the petitioners, this 

judgment will not deal with any of the other contentions. 

2. 
"It is emphatically the province and duty of the 
judicial department to say what the law is. Those who 
apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity 
expound and interpret that rule." 

What was said over 200 years ago by Chief Justice John Marshall in 

the celebrated case of Marbury v. Madison, holds true even today in every 

great republican system of Government. 

These words take their colour from Alexander Hamilton's famous 

federalist Paper No.78 which ran thus: 

"Whoever attentively considers the different departments 
of power must perceive, that, in a government in which they are 
separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its 
functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political 
rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity 
to annoy or injure them. The Executive not only dispenses the 
honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature 

239 


Page 240 

not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which 
the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The 
judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the 
sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the 
wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution 
whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor 
WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon 
the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its 
judgments. 
This simple view of the matter suggests several 
important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the 
judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three 
departments of power, that it can never attack with success 
either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to 
enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It equally proves, 
that though individual oppression may now and then proceed 
from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can 
never be endangered from that quarter, I mean so long as the 
judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and 
the Executive. For I agree, that "there is no liberty, if the 
power of judging be not separated from the legislative and 
executive powers. And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty 
can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would 
have everything to fear from its union with either of the other 
departments; that as all the effects of such a union must ensue 
from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding 
a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from the natural 
feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being 
overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; 
and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and 
independence as permanency in office, this quality may 
therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in 
its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the 
public justice and the public security." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

3. 
The precise question arising in these appeals concerns the 

constitutional validity of the National Tax Tribunals Act, 2005. The question 

raised on behalf of the petitioners is one of great public importance and has, 

240 


Page 241 

therefore, been placed before this Constitution Bench. Following upon the 

heels of the judgment in Union of India v. R.Gandhi, (2010) 11 SCC 1, 

these matters were delinked and ordered to be heard separately vide judgment 

and order dated 11 th May 2010 reported in (2010) 11 SCC 67. The precise 

question formulated on behalf of the petitioners is whether a tribunal can 

substitute the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction, when it comes to 

deciding substantial questions of law. 

4. 
Sections 15 and 24 of National Tax Tribunal Act state: 

"15. (1) An appeal shall lie to the National Tax Tribunal from 
every order passed in appeal by the Income-tax Appellate 
Tribunal and the Customs, Excise and Service Tax appellate 
Tribunal, if the National Tax Tribunal is satisfied that the case 
involves a substantial question of law. 
(2) The Chief Commissioner or the Commissioner of Income-tax 
or the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner of Customs and 
Central Excise, as the case may be, or an assessee aggrived by 
any order passed by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal or any 
person aggrieved by any order passed by the Customs, Excise 
and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 
aggrieved person), may file an appeal to the National Tax 
Tribunal and such appeal under this sub-section shall-
(a) be filed within one hundred and twenty days from the date 
on which the order appealed against is received by the assesee 
or the aggrieved person or the Chief Commissioner or 
Commissioner, as the case may be; 
(b) be in the form of a memorandum of appeal precisely stating 
therein the substantial question of law involved; and 
(c) be accompanied by such fees as may be prescribed: 
Provided that separate form of memorandum of appeal shall be 
filed for matters involving direct and indirect taxes: 
Provided further that the National Tax Tribunal may entertain 
the appeal within sixty days after the expiry of the said period of 

241 


Page 242 

one hundred and twenty days, if it is satisfied that the appellant 
was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring an appeal in 
time. 
(3) Where an appeal is admitted under sub-section (1), the 
National Tax Tribunal.-
(a) shall formulate the question of law for hearing the appeal; 
and 
(b) may also determine any relevant issue in connection with the 
question so formulated-
(i) which has not been so determined by the Income-tax 
Appellate Tribunal or by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax 
Appellate Tribunal or 
(ii) which has been wrongly determined by the income-tax 
Appellate Tribunal or by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax 
Appellate Tribunal, and shall decide the question of law so 
formulated and the other relevant issue so determined and 
deliver such judgment thereon containing the grounds on which 
such decision is founded and may award such cost as it deems 
fit. 
(4) Where in any appeal under this section, the decision of the 
income-tax Appellate Tribunal or the Customs, Excise and 
Service Tax Appellate Tribunal involves the payment of any tax 
or duties, the assessee or the aggrieved person, as the case may 
be, shall not be allowed to prefer such appeal unless he deposits 
at least twenty-five per cent of such tax or duty payable on the 
basis of the order appealed against: 
Provided that where in a particular case the National Tax 
Tribunal is of the opinion that the deposit of tax or duty under 
this sub-section would case undue hardship to such person, it 
may dispense with such deposit subject to such conditions as it 
may deem fit to impose so as to safeguard the interest of 
revenue. 
24. Appeal to Supreme Court.-Any person including any 
department of the Government aggrieved by any decision or 
order of the National tax Tribunal may file an appeal to the 
Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the National Tax 
Tribunal to him; 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 

242 


Page 243 

appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within such 
time as it may deem fit." 

5. 
According to the petitioners, deciding substantial questions of law, 

even if they arise from specialized subject matters, would be a core function 

of the superior courts of India, and cannot be usurped by any other forum. 

To test the validity of this argument, we need to go to some constitutional 

fundamentals. 

6. 
It has been recognized that unlike the U.S. Constitution, the 

Constitution of India does not have a rigid separation of powers. Despite that, 

the Constitution contains several separate chapters devoted to each of the 

three branches of Government. Chapter IV of part V deals exclusively with 

the Union judiciary and Chapter V of part VI deals with the High Courts in 

the States. 

7. 
Article 50 of the Constitution states: 

"50. Separation of judiciary from executive: The State shall 
take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the 
public services of the State." 

8. 
Art.129 states that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record and 

shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for 

contempt of itself. Art.131 vests the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction 

in disputes arising between the Government of India and the States. Art. 132 

243 


Page 244 

to 134A vest an appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases from the 

High Courts. Art. 136 vests the Supreme Court with an extraordinary 

discretionary jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, 

decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or 

made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. Under Art. 137, the 

Supreme Court is given power to review any judgment or order made by it. 

By Article 141, the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on 

all courts within the territory of India. And by virtue of Art. 145(3) 

substantial questions as to the interpretation of the Constitution of India are 

vested exclusively in a bench of at least 5 Hon'ble Judges. 

9. 
Similarly, under Art. 214 High Courts for each State are established 

and under Art. 215 like the Supreme Court, High Courts shall be courts of 

record and shall have all the powers of such courts including the power to 

punish for contempt. Under Art. 225, the jurisdiction of, and the law 

administered in any existing High Courts, is preserved. Art. 226 vests the 

High Court with power to issue various writs for the protection of 

fundamental rights and for any other purpose to any person or authority. 

Under Art. 228 questions involving interpretation of the constitution are to be 

decided by the High Court alone when a court subordinate to it is seized of 

such question. Further, the importance of these provisions is further 

244 


Page 245 

highlighted by Art. 368 proviso which allows an amendment of all the 

aforesaid Articles only if such amendment is also ratified by the legislatures 

of not less than one half of the States. 

10. The Code of Civil Procedure also contains provisions which vest the 

High Court with the power to decide certain questions of law under Section 

113 and, when they relate to jurisdictional errors, Section 115. 

11. Art. 227 is of ancient vintage. It has its origins in Section 107 of the 

Government of India Act 1915 which reads as follows: 

"Each of the High Courts has superintendence over all 
courts for the time being subject to its appellate 
jurisdiction, and may do any of the following things, that is 
to say.-
(a) Call for returns; 
(b) Direct the transfer of any suit or appeal from any 
such court to any other court of equal or superior 
jurisdiction; 
(c) Make and issue general rules and prescribe forms 
for regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; 
(d) Prescribe forms in which books, entries and 
accounts shall be kept by the officers of any such courts; 
and settle tables of fees to be allowed to the sheriff, 
attorneys and all clerks and officers of courts: 
Provided that such rules, forms and tables shall not be 
inconsistent with the provisions of law for the time being in 
force, and shall require the previous approval, in the case 
of the high court at Calcutta, of the Governor-General in 
Council, and in other cases of the local government." 

12. Section 224 of the Government of India Act 1935 more or less adopted 

Section 107 of the Act of 1915 with a few changes. 

245 


Page 246 

"(1)Every High Court shall have superintendence over all 
courts in India for the time being subject to its appellate 
jurisdiction, and may do any of the following thing, that is to 
say,-
(a) call for returns; 
(b) make and issue general rules and prescribe forms for 
regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; 
(c) prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts 
shall be kept by the officers of any such courts; and 
(d) settle tables of fees to be allowed to the sheriff, 
attorneys, and all clerks and officers of courts: 
Provided that such rules, forms and tables shall not be 
inconsistent with the provision of any law for the time being in 
force, and shall require the previous approval of the 
Governor. 
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as giving to a 
High Court any jurisdiction to question any judgment of any 
inferior Court which is not otherwise subject to appeal or 
revision." 
Article 227 of the Constitution states: 
227. Power of superintendence over all courts by the High 
Court 
(1) Every High Court shall have superintendence over all courts 
and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it 
exercises jurisdiction 
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing 
provisions, the High Court may 
(a) call for returns from such courts; 
(b) make and issue general rules and prescribe forms for 
regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; and 
(c) prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts shall 
be kept by the officers of any such courts 
(3) The High Court may also settle tables of fees to be allowed 
to the sheriff and all clerks and officers of such courts and to 
attorneys, advocates and pleaders practising therein: 
Provided that any rules made, forms prescribed or tables settled 
under clause ( 2 ) or clause ( 3 ) shall not be inconsistent with 
the provision of any law for the time being in force, and shall 
require the previous approval of the Governor 

246 


Page 247 

(4) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to confer on a High 
Court powers of superintendence over any court or tribunal 
constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces." 

13. It will be noticed that Art. 227 adds the words "and tribunals" and 

contains no requirement that the superintendence over subordinate courts and 

tribunals should be subject to its appellate jurisdiction. 

14. In Waryam Singh v. Amarnath, 1954 SCR 565, Das,J. stated the 

High Courts power under Art. 227: 

"This power of superintendence conferred by article 227 is, as 
pointed out by Harries C.J., in Dalmia Jain Airways Ltd. v. 
Sukumar Mukherjee, to be exercised most sparingly and only in 
appropriate cases in order to keep the Subordinate Courts 
within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere 
errors. As rightly pointed out by the Judicial Commissioner in 
the case before us the lower courts in refusing to make an order 
for ejectment acted arbitrarily. The lower courts realized the 
legal position but in effect declined to do what was by section 
13(2) (i) incumbent on them to do and thereby refused to 
exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law. It was, therefore, a 
case which called for interference by the court of the Judicial 
Commissioner and it acted quite properly in doing so." (at 571) 

15. It is axiomatic that the superintending power of the High Courts under 

Art. 227 is to keep courts and tribunals within the bounds of the law. Hence, 

errors of law that are apparent on the face of the record are liable to be 

corrected. In correcting such errors, the High Court has necessarily to state 

what the law is by deciding questions of law, which bind subordinate courts 

and tribunals in future cases. Despite the fact that there is no equivalent of 

247 


Page 248 

Art. 141 so far as High Courts are concerned, in East India Commercial Co. 

Ltd. Calcutta v. The Collector of Customs, (1963) 3 SCR 338, Subba Rao, 

J. stated: 

"This raises the question whether an administrative tribunal 
can ignore the law declared by the highest court in the State 
and initiate proceedings in direct violation of the law so 
declared. Under Art. 215, every High Court shall be a court of 
record including the power to punish for contempt of itself. 
Under Art. 226, it has a plenary power to issue orders or writs 
for the enforcement of the fundamental rights and for any other 
purpose to any person or authority, including in appropriate 
cases any Government, within its territorial jurisdiction. Under 
Art. 227 it has jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals 
throughout the territories in relation to which it exercise 
jurisdiction. It would be anomalous to suggest that a tribunal 
over which the High Court has superintendant can ignore the 
law declared by that court and start proceedings in direct 
violation of it. If a tribunal can do so, all the sub-ordinate 
courts can equally do so, for there is no specific provision, just 
like in the case of Supreme Court, making the law declared by 
the High Court binding on subordinate courts. It is implicit in 
the power of supervision conferred on a superior tribunal that 
all the tribunals subject to its supervision should conform to the 
law laid down by it. Such obedience would also be conducive 
to their smooth working: otherwise there would be confusion in 
the administration of law and respect for law would 
irretrievably suffer. We, therefore, hold that the law declared 
by the highest court in the State is binding on authorities or 
tribunals under its superintendence, and that they cannot 
ignore it either in initiating a proceeding or deciding on the 
rights involved in such a proceeding."(at 366) 

16. The aforesaid analysis shows that the decision by superior courts of 

record of questions of law and the binding effect of such decisions are 

implicit in the constitutional scheme of things. It is obvious that it is 

248 


Page 249 

emphatically the province of the superior judiciary to answer substantial 

questions of law not only for the case at hand but also in order to guide 

subordinate courts and tribunals in future. That this is the core of the judicial 

function as outlined by the constitutional provisions set out above. 

17. As to what is a substantial question of law has been decided way back 

in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta v. The Century Spinning and Manufacturing 

Co. Ltd., (1962) Suppl. 3 SCR 549 at pages 557-558 thus: 

"….The proper test for determining whether a question of law 
raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion, be 
whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly 
and substantially affects the rights of the parties and if so 
whether it is either an open question in the sense that it is not 
finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the 
Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or calls for 
discussion of alternative views. If the question is settled by the 
highest Court or the general principles to be applied in 
determining the question are well settled and there is a mere 
question of applying those principles or that the plea raised is 
palpably absurd the question would not be a substantial 
question of law." 

18. It is clear, therefore, that the decision of a substantial question of law is 

a matter of great moment. It must be a question of law which is of general 

public importance or is not free from difficulty and/or calls for a discussion 

of alternative views. It is clear, therefore, that a judicially trained mind with 

the experience of deciding questions of law is a sine qua non in order that 

such questions be decided correctly. Interestingly enough, our attention has 

249 


Page 250 

been drawn to various Acts where appeals are on questions of law/substantial 

questions of law. 

"i) The Electricity Act, 2003 
125. Appeal to Supreme Court -Any person aggrieved by any 
decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal, may, file an appeal 
to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the Appellate 
Tribunal to him, on any one or more of the grounds specified in 
Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908): 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 
appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a 
further period not exceeding sixty days. 
(ii) The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 
Section 22. Appeal to Supreme Court -Any person aggrieved by 
any award, decision or order of the tribunal, may, file an appeal 
to the Supreme Court, within ninety days from the date of 
communication of the award, decision or order of Tribunal, to 
him, on any one or more of the grounds specified in Section 100 
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) . 
Provided that the Supreme Court, entertain any appeal after the 
expiry of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was 
prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal. 
(iii) The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 
Section 18. Appeal to Supreme Court -(1) Notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 
1908) or in any other law, an appeal shall lie against any order, 
not being an interlocutory order, of the Appellate Tribunal to 
the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds specified in 
section 100 of that code. 
(2) No appeal shall lie against any decision or order made by 
the Appellate Tribunal with the consent of the parties. 
(3) Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a 
period of ninety days from the date of the decision or order 
appealed against: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain the appeal after 
the expiry of the said period of ninety days, if it is satisfied that 

250 


Page 251 

the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring 
the appeal in time. 
(iv) The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 
Section 15Z. Appeal to Supreme Court. -Any person aggrieved 
by any decision or order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal 
may file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from 
the date of communication of the decision or order of the 
Securities Appellate Tribunal to him on any question of law 
arising out to such order: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 
appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a 
further period not exceeding sixty days. 
(v) Companies Act, 1956 
Section 10GF. Appeal to Supreme Court. -Any person 
aggrieved by any decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal 
may file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from 
the date of communication of the decision or order of the 
Appellate Tribunal to him on any question of law arising out of 
such decision or order: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 
appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a 
further period not exceeding sixty days." 

19. Whether one looks at the old Section 100 of the Code of Civil 

Procedure or Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure as substituted in 

1976, the result is that the superior courts alone are vested with the power to 

decide questions of law. 

Section 100 (Before amendment) 
"100(1). Save where otherwise expressly provided in the body 
of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an 
appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in 
appeal by any court subordinate to a High Court on any of the 
following grounds, namely: 

251 


Page 252 

(a) the decision being contrary to law or to some usage 
having the force of law; 
(b) the decision having failed to determine some material 
issue of law or usage having the force of law; 
(c) a substantial error or defect in the procedure provided 
by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, 
which may possibly have produced error or defect in the 
decision of the case upon the merits. 
(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate 
decree passed ex-parte. 
Section 100 (After amendment) 
100. Second appeal 
(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this 
Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal 
shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal 
by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court 
is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. 
(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate 
decree passed exparte. 
(3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of appeal 
shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in 
the appeal. 
(4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial 
question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that 
question. 
(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated 
and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be 
allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question : 
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to 
take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for 
reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial 
question of law, not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the 
case involves such question." 

20. It is obvious that hitherto Parliament has entrusted a superior court of 

record with decisions on questions of law/substantial questions of law. Also, 

as has been pointed in Khehar, J.'s judgment traditionally, such questions 

252 


Page 253 

were always decided by the High Courts in the country. The present Act is a 

departure made for the first time by Parliament. 

21. In this regard, the respondents argued that since taxation is a 

specialised subject and there is a complete code laid down for deciding this 

subject, the present impugned Act being part of that code is constitutionally 

valid. For this purpose, the respondents have relied on a passage from the 

nine Judge Bench in Mafatlal Industries v. Union of India, (1997) 5 SCC 

536 at para 77. 

22. This Court in Mafatlal's case was faced with whether Kanhaiya Lal 

Mukundlal Saraf's case, 1959 SCR 1350, has been correctly decided in so 

far as it said that where taxes are paid under a mistake of law, the person 

paying is entitled to recover from the State such taxes on establishing the 

mistake and that this consequence flows from Section 72 of the Contract Act. 

In answering this question, this Court made an observation that so long as an 

appeal is provided to the Supreme Court from the orders of the appellate 

tribunal, the Act would be constitutionally valid. This Court while deciding 

whether Saraf's case was correctly decided or not, was not faced with the 

present question at all. Further, at the time that Mafatlal's case was decided, 

the scheme contained in the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, required the 

High Court on a statement of case made to it to decide a question of law 

253 


Page 254 

arising out of the order of the appellate tribunal, after which the High Court is 

to deliver its judgment and send it back to the appellate tribunal which will 

then make such orders as are necessary to dispose of the case in conformity 

with such judgment. The then statutory scheme of the Central Excise and 

Salt Act, 1944 is contained in Sections 35G to 35L. 

"35G Statement of case to High Court. 
(1) The Collector of Central Excise or the other party may, 
within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with 
notice of an order under section 35C (not being an order 
relating, among other things, to the determination of any 
question having a relation to the rate of duty of excise or to the 
value of goods for purposes of assessment), by application in 
the prescribed form, accompanied, where the application is 
made by the other party, by a fee of two hundred rupees, 
require the Appellate Tribunal to refer to the High Court any 
question of law arising out of such order and, subject to the 
other provisions contained in this section, the Appellate 
Tribunal shall, within one hundred and twenty days of the 
receipt of such application, draw up a statement of the case and 
refer it to the High Court: 
Provided that the Appellate Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that 
the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting 
the application within the period hereinbefore specified, allow 
it to be presented within a further period not exceeding thirty 
days. 
(2) On receipt of notice that an application has been made 
under sub-section (1), the person against whom such 
application has been made, may, notwithstanding that he may 
not have filed such an application, file, within forty-five days 
of the receipt of the notice, a memorandum of cross-objections 
verified in the prescribed manner against any part of the order 
in relation to which an application for reference has been made 
and such memorandum shall be disposed of by the Appellate 
Tribunal as if it were an application presented within the time 
specified in sub-section (1). 

254 


Page 255 

(3) If, on an application made under sub-section (1), the 
Appellate Tribunal refuses to state the case on the ground that 
no question of law arises, the Collector of Central Excise, or, 
as the case may be, the other party may, within six months from 
the date on which he is served with notice of such refusal, apply 
to the High Court and the High Court may, if it is not satisfied 
with the correctness of the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, 
require the Appellate Tribunal to state the case and to refer it, 
and on receipt of any such requisition, the Appellate Tribunal 
shall state the case and refer it accordingly. 
(4) Where in the exercise of its powers under sub-section (3), 
the Appellate Tribunal refuses to state a case which it has been 
required by an applicant to state, the applicant may, within 
thirty days from the date on which he receives notice of such 
refusal, withdraw his application and, if he does so, the fee, if 
any, paid by him shall be refunded. 
35H. Statement of case to Supreme court in certain cases. If, on 
an application made under section 35G, the Appellate Tribunal 
is of opinion that, on account of conflict in the decisions of 
High Courts in respect of any particular question of law, it is 
expedient that a reference should be made direct to the 
Supreme Court, the Appellate Tribunal may draw up a 
statement of the case and refer it through the President direct 
to the Supreme Court. 
35I. Power of High Court or Supreme Court to require 
statement to be amended. If the High Court or the Supreme 
Court is not satisfied that the statements in a case referred to it 
are sufficient to enable it to determine the questions raised 
thereby, the Court may refer the case back to the Appellate 
Tribunal, for the purpose of making such additions thereto or 
alterations therein as it may direct in that behalf. 
35J. Case before High Court to be heard by not less than two 
Judges. 
(1) When any case has been referred to the High Court under 
section 35G, it shall be heard by a Bench of not less than two 
Judges of the High Court and shall be decided in accordance 
with the opinion of such Judges or of the majority, if any, of 
such Judges. 
(2) Where there is no such majority, the Judges shall state the 
point of law upon which they differ and the case shall then be 

255 


Page 256 

heard upon that point only by one or more of the other Judges 
of the High Court, and such point shall be decided according to 
the opinion of the majority of the Judges who have heard the 
case including those who first heard it. 
35K. Decision of High Court or Supreme Court on the case 
stated. 
(1) The High Court or the Supreme Court hearing any such 
case shall decide the questions of law raised therein and shall 
deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which 
such decision is founded and a copy of the judgment shall be 
sent under the seal of the Court and the signature of the 
Registrar to the Appellate Tribunal which shall pass such 
orders as are necessary to dispose of the case in conformity 
with such judgment. 
(2) The costs of any reference to the High Court or the Supreme 
Court which shall not include the fee for making the reference 
shall be in the discretion of the Court. 
35L. Appeal to Supreme Court. An appeal shall lie to the 
Supreme Court from-
(a) any judgment of the High Court delivered on a reference 
made under section 35G in any case which, on its own motion 
or on an oral application made by or on behalf of the party 
aggrieved, immediately after the passing of the judgment, the 
High Court certifies to be a fit one for appeal to the Supreme 
Court; or 
(b) any order passed by the Appellate Tribunal relating, among 
other things, to the determination of any question having a 
relation to the rate of duty of excise or to the value of goods for 
purposes of assessment." 

23. It is obvious that the decision of the nine Judge Bench was only 

referring to decisions of the appellate tribunal falling under sub-clause (b) of 

Section 35L relating to orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal on questions 

having a relation to the rate of duty of excise or value of goods for the 

purpose of assessment and not to appeals from judgments of the High Court 

256 


Page 257 

delivered on a reference under Section 35G after the High Court had decided 

on a question of law. It is clear, therefore, that the context of Mafatlal's 

decision was completely different and the decision did not advert to Sections 

35G to 35L as they then stood. 

24. Art. 323B was part of the constitution 42 nd Amendment Act which was, 

as is well known, an amendment which was rushed through during the 1975 

emergency. Many of its features were undone by the constitution 44 th 

Amendment Act passed a couple of years later. One of the interesting 

features that was undone was the amendment to Art. 227. 

The 42 nd Amendment substituted the following clause for clause (1) of 

Art. 227: 

"(1) Every High Court shall have superintendence over 
all courts subject to its appellate jurisdiction." 

25. A cursory reading of the substituted clause shows that the old section 

107 of the Government of India Act 1915 was brought back: Tribunals were 

no longer subject to the High Courts' superintendence, and subordinate 

courts were only subject to the High Courts' superintendence, if they were 

also subject to its appellate jurisdiction. As stated above, the 44 th Amendment 

undid this and restored sub-clause (1) to its original position. 

26. However, Art. 323B continues as part of the constitution. The real 

reason for the insertion of the said article was the same as the amendment 

257 


Page 258 

made to Art. 227 -the removal of the High Courts' supervisory jurisdiction 

over tribunals. L. Chandra Kumar v.Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261, 

undid the very raison d'etre of Article 323B by restoring the supervisory 

jurisdiction of the High Courts so that a reference to Article 323B would no 

longer be necessary as the legislative competence to make a law relating to 

tribunals would in any case be traceable to Entries 77 to79, 95 of List I, Entry 

65 of List II and Entry 11A and 46 of List III of the 7 th Schedule to the 

Constitution of India. 

27. In a significant statement of the law, Chandra Kumar's judgment, in 

upholding the vesting of the High Court's original jurisdiction in a Central 

Administrative Tribunal, stated thus: 

"The legitimacy of the power of Courts within constitutional 
democracies to review legislative action has been questioned 
since the time it was first conceived. The Constitution of India, 
being alive to such criticism, has, while conferring such power 
upon the higher judiciary, incorporated important safeguards. 
An analysis of the manner in which the Framers of our 
Constitution incorporated provisions relating to the judiciary 
would indicate that they were very greatly concerned with 
securing the independence of the judiciary. These attempts 
were directed at ensuring that the judiciary would be capable 
of effectively discharging its wide powers of judicial review. 
While the Constitution confers the power to strike down laws 
upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court, it also contains 
elaborate provisions dealing with the tenure, salaries, 
allowances, retirement age of Judges as well as the mechanism 
for selecting Judges to the superior courts. The inclusion of 
such elaborate provisions appears to have been occasioned by 

258 


Page 259 

the belief that, armed by such provisions, the superior courts 
would be insulated from any executive or legislative attempts to 
interfere with the making of their decisions. The Judges of the 
superior courts have been entrusted with the task of upholding 
the Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power 
to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure that the balance of 
power envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and that the 
legislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their 
functions, transgress constitutional limitations. It is equally 
their duty to oversee that the judicial decisions rendered by 
those who man the subordinate courts and tribunals do not fall 
foul of strict standards of legal correctness and judicial 
independence. The constitutional safeguards which ensure the 
independence of the Judges of the superior judiciary, are not 
available to the Judges of the subordinate judiciary or to those 
who man Tribunals created by ordinary legislations. 
Consequently, Judges of the latter category can never be 
considered full and effective substitutes for the superior 
judiciary in discharging the function of constitutional 
interpretation. We, therefore, hold that the power of judicial 
review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under 
Articles 226 and in this Court under Article 32 of the 
Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the 
Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. Ordinarily, 
therefore, the power of High Courts and the Supreme Court to 
test the constitutional validity of legislations can never be 
ousted or excluded.(See Para 78) 

We also hold that the power vested in the High Courts to 
exercise judicial superintendence over the decisions of all 
Courts and Tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is 
also part of the basic structure of the Constitution. This is 
because a situation where the High Courts are divested of all 
other judicial functions apart from that of constitutional 
interpretation, is equally to be avoided. (See Para 79) 

Before moving on to other aspects, we may summarise our 
conclusions on the jurisdictional powers of these Tribunals. 
The Tribunals are competent to hear matters where the vires of 
statutory provisions are questioned. However, in discharging 

259 


Page 260 

this duty, they cannot act as substitutes for the High Courts and 
the Supreme Court which have, under our constitutional set-up, 
been specifically entrusted with such an obligation. Their 
function in this respect is only supplementary and all such 
decisions of the Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a 
Division Bench of the respective High Courts."(see Para 93) 

28. The stage is now set for the Attorney General's reliance on Union of 

India v. R. Gandhi (2010) 11 SCC 1. 

Various provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 were under challenge 

before the Constitution Bench. The effect of these provisions was to replace 

the Company Law Board by a Tribunal vested with original jurisdiction, and 

to replace the High Court in First Appeal with an appellate tribunal. After 

noticing the difference between courts and tribunals in paras 38 and 45, the 

court referred to the independence of the judiciary and to the separation of 

powers doctrine, as understood in the Indian Constitutional Context in paras 

46 to 57. In a significant statement of the law, the Constitution Bench said: 

"The Constitution contemplates judicial power being exercised 
by both courts and tribunals. Except the powers and 
jurisdiction vested in superior courts by the Constitution, 
powers and jurisdiction of courts are controlled and regulated 
by legislative enactments. The High Courts are vested with the 
jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals, revisions and 
references in pursuance of provisions contained in several 
specific legislative enactments. If jurisdiction of High Courts 
can be created by providing for appeals, revisions and 
references to be heard by the High Courts, jurisdiction can also 
be taken away by deleting the provisions for appeals, revisions 
or references. It also follows that the legislature has the power 
to create Tribunals with reference to specific enactments and 

260 


Page 261 

confer jurisdiction on them to decide disputes in regard to 
matters arising from such special enactments. Therefore it 
cannot be said that legislature has no power to transfer judicial 
functions traditionally performed by courts to Tribunals." 
(para 87) 

In another significant paragraph, the Constitution bench stated: 
"But when we say that the legislature has the competence to 
make laws, providing which disputes will be decided by courts, 
and which disputes will be decided by tribunals, it is subject to 
constitutional limitations, without encroaching upon the 
independence of the judiciary and keeping in view the 
principles of the rule of law and separation of powers. If 
tribunals are to be vested with judicial power hitherto vested in 
or exercised by courts, such tribunals should possess the 
independence, security and capacity associated with courts. If 
the tribunals are intended to serve an area which requires 
specialized knowledge or expertise, no doubt there can be 
technical members in addition to judicial members. Where 
however jurisdiction to try certain category of cases are 
transferred from courts to tribunals only to expedite the 
hearing and disposal or relieve from the rigours of the 
Evidence Act and procedural laws, there is obviously no need 
to have any non-judicial technical member. In respect of such 
tribunals, only members of the judiciary should be the 
Presiding Officers/Members. Typical examples of such special 
tribunals are Rent Tribunals, Motor Accidents Claims 
Tribunals and Special Courts under several enactments. 
Therefore, when transferring the jurisdiction exercised by 
courts to tribunals, which does not involve any specialized 
knowledge or expertise in any field and expediting the disposal 
and relaxing the procedure is the only object, a provision for 
technical members in addition to or in substitution of judicial 
members would clearly be a case of dilution of and 
encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary and the 
rule of law and would be unconstitutional."(at para 90) 

The Bench then went on to hold that only certain areas of litigation can 

be transferred from courts to tribunals. (see para 92) 

261 


Page 262 

In paragraphs 101 and 102 the law is stated thus: 
"Independent judicial tribunals for determination of the 
rights of citizens, and for adjudication of the disputes and 
complaints of the citizens, is a necessary concomitant of the 
rule of law. The rule of law has several facets, one of which is 
that disputes of citizens will be decided by Judges who are 
independent and impartial; and that disputes as to legality of 
acts of the Government will be decided by Judges who are 
independent of the executive. Another facet of the rule of law is 
equality before law. The essence of the equality is that it must 
be capable of being enforced and adjudicated by an 
independent judicial forum. 
Judicial independence and 
separation of judicial power from the executive are part of the 
common law traditions implicit in a Constitution like ours 
which is based on the Westminster model. 
The fundamental right to equality before law and equal 
protection of laws guaranteed by Art.14 of the Constitution, 
clearly includes a right to have the person's rights, adjudicated 
by a forum which exercises judicial power in an impartial and 
independent manner, consistent with the recognized principles 
of adjudication. Therefore wherever access to courts to enforce 
such rights is sought to be abridged, altered, modified or 
substituted by directing him to approach an alternative forum, 
such legislative act is open to challenge if it violates the right to 
adjudication by an independent forum. Therefore, though the 
challenge by MBA is on the ground of violation of principles 
forming part of the basic structure, they are relatable to one of 
more of the express provisions of the Constitution which gave 
rise to such principles. Though the validity of the provisions of 
a legislative act cannot be challenged on the ground it violates 
the basic structure of the Constitution, it can be challenged as 
violative of constitutional provisions which enshrine the 
principles of the rule of law, separation of powers and 
independence of the judiciary." 

29. Gandhi's case dealt with one specialized tribunal replacing another 

specialized tribunal (The Company Law Board) at the original stage. It is 

significant to note that the first appeal provided to the appellate tribunal is not 

262 


Page 263 

restricted only to questions of law. It is a full first appeal as understood in the 

section 96 CPC sense -(See section 10FQ of the Companies Act). A further 

appeal is provided to the Supreme Court under Section 10GF only on 

questions of law. When Gandhi's case states in paragraph 87 that the 

jurisdiction of the High Courts can be taken away by deleting provisions for 

appeals, revisions or references, and that these functions traditionally 

performed by courts can be transferred to tribunals, the court was only 

dealing with the situation of the High Court being supplanted at the original 

and first appellate stage so far as the company `jurisdiction' is concerned in a 

situation where questions of fact have to be determined afresh at the first 

appellate stage as well. These observations obviously cannot be logically 

extended to cover a situation like the present where the High Court is being 

supplanted by a tribunal which would be deciding only substantial questions 

of law. 

30. The present case differs from Gandhi's case in a very fundamental 

manner. The National Tax Tribunal which replaces the High Courts in the 

country replaces them only to decide substantial questions of law which 

relate to taxation. In fact, a Direct Tax Laws Committee delivered a report in 

1978 called the Choksi Committee after its Chairman. This report had in fact 

recommended that a Central Tax Court should be set up. The report stated: 

263 


Page 264 

"II-6.10. In paragraph 11.30 of our Interim Report, we had 
expressed the view that the Government should consider the 
establishment of a Central Tax Court to deal with all matters 
arising under the Income-tax Act and other Central Tax Laws, 
and had left the matter for consideration in greater detail in 
our Final Report. We have since examined the matter from all 
aspects. 
II-6.11. The problem of tax litigation in India has assumed 
staggering proportions in recent years. From the statistics 
supplied to us, it is seen that, as on 30 th June, 1977, there were 
as many as 10,500 references under the direct tax laws pending 
with the various High Courts, the largest pendency being in 
Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. 
The number of references made to the High Courts in India 
under all the tax laws is of the order of about 3,300 in a year, 
whereas the annual disposals of such references by all the High 
Courts put together amount to about 600 in a year. In addition 
to these references, about 750 writ petitions on tax matters are 
also filed before the High Courts every year. Under the existing 
practice of each High Court having only a single bench for 
dealing with the tax matters and that too not all round the year, 
there is obviously no likelihood of the problem being brought 
down to manageable proportions at any time in, the future, but, 
on the other hand, it is likely to become worse. Even writ 
petitions seeking urgent remedy against executive action take 
several years for disposal. The Wanchoo Committee, which 
had considered this problem, recommended the creation of 
permanent Tax Benches in High Courts and appointment of 
retired Judges to such Benches under Article 224A of the 
Constitution to clear the backlog. Although more than 6 years 
have passed since that recommendation was made, the position 
of arrears in tax matters has shown no improvement but, on the 
other hand, it has worsened. In this connection, it would be 
worth noting that the Wanchoo Committee considered an 
alternative course for dealing with this problem through the 
establishment of a Tax Court but they desisted from making any 
recommendation to that effect us, in their opinion, that would 
involve extensive amendments to law and procedures. We have 
directed our attention to this matter in the context of the 
mounting arrears of tax cases before the courts. 

264 


Page 265 

II-6.12. The pendency of cases before the courts in tax matters 
has also a snow-balling effect all along the line of appellate 
hierarchies inasmuch as proceedings in hundreds of cases are 
initiated and kept pending, awaiting the law to be finally settled 
by the Supreme Court after prolonged litigation in some other 
cases. This obviously adds considerably to the load of 
infructuous word in the Department and clutters up the files of 
appellate authorities at all levels, with adverse consequences 
on their efficiency. According to the figures supplied to us, out 
of tax arrears amounting to Rs.986.53 crores as on 31 st 
December, 1977, Rs.293.26 crores (30 per cent) were disputed 
in proceedings before various appellate authorities and courts. 
II-6.13. 
Apart from the delays which are inherent in the 
existing system, the jurisdiction pattern of the High Courts also 
seems to contribute to the generation of avoidable work. At 
present, High Courts are obliged to hear references on matters 
falling within their jurisdiction notwithstanding that references 
on identical points have been decided by other High Courts. 
The decision of one High Court is not binding on another High 
Court even on identical issues. Finality is reached only when 
the Supreme Court decides the issue which may take 10 to 15 
years. 
II-6.14. Tax litigation is currently handled by different 
Benches of the High Courts constituted on an ad hoc basis. 
The absence of permanent benches also accounts for the delay 
in the disposal of the tax cases by High Courts. 
II-6.15. 
The answer to these problems, in our view, is the 
establishment of a Central 
Tax Court with all-India 
jurisdiction to deal with such litigation to the exclusion of High 
Courts. Such a step will have several advantages. In the first 
place, it would lead to uniformity in decisions and bring a 
measure of certainty in tax matters. References involving 
common issues can be conveniently consolidated and disposed 
of together, thereby accelerating the pace of disposal. Better 
co-ordination among the benches would make for speedy 
disposal of cases and reduce the scope for proliferation of 
appeals on the same issues before the lower appellate 
authorities, which in its turn will reduce the volume of 
litigation going up before the Tax Court as well. Once a 
Central Tax Court is established, the judges appointed to the 

265 


Page 266 

Benches thereof will develop the requisite expertise by 
continuous working in this field. This would facilitate quicker 
disposal of tax matters and would also help in reducing 
litigation by ensuring uniformity in decisions. 
II-6.16. 
In the light of the foregoing discussions, we 
recommend that the Government should take steps for this 
early establishment of a Central Tax Court with all-India 
jurisdiction to deal exclusively with litigation under the direct 
Tax laws in the first instance, with provisions for extending its 
jurisdiction to cover all other Central Tax laws, if considered 
necessary in the future. We suggest that such a court should be 
constituted under a separate statute. As the implementation of 
this recommendation may necessitate amendment of the 
constitution, which is likely to take time, we further recommend 
that Government may in the meanwhile, consider the 
desirability of constituting special Tax benches in the High 
Courts to deal with the large number of Tax cases by 
continuously sitting throughout the year. The Judges to be 
appointed to these special benches may be selected from among 
those, who have special knowledge and experience in dealing 
with matters relating to direct Tax laws so that, when the 
Central Tax Court is established at a later date, these judges 
could be transferred to that Court. 
II-6.17. 
The Central Tax Court should have Benches 
located at important centres. To start with it may have Benches 
at the following seven places, viz., Ahmedabad, Bombay, 
Calcutta, Delhi, Kanpur, Madras and Nagpur. Each Bench 
should consist of two judges. Highly qualified persons should 
be appointed as judges of the Central Tax Court, from among 
persons who are High Court judges or who are eligible to be 
appointed as High Court judges. In the matter of conditions of 
service, scales or pay and other privileges, judges of the 
Central Tax Court should be on par with the High Court 
judges. 
II-6.18. The Supreme Court and, following it, the High Courts 
have held that the Tribunal and the tax authorities, being 
creatures of the Act cannot pronounce on the constitutional 
validity or vires of any provision of the Act; that; therefore, 
such a question cannot arise out of the order of the Tribunal 
and cannot be made the subject matter of a reference to the 

266 


Page 267 

High Court and a subsequent appeal to the Supreme court; and 
that such a question of validity or vires can be raised only in a 
suit or a writ petition. While an income-tax authority or the 
Tribunal cannot decide upon the validity or vires of the other 
provisions of the law. We recommend that the powers of the 
Central Tax Court in this regard should be clarified in the law 
itself by specifically giving it the right to go into questions of 
validity of the provisions of the Tax Laws or of the rules framed 
thereunder. 
II-6.19. Another important matter, in which we consider that 
the present position needs improvement, is the nature of the 
Court's jurisdiction in tax matters. Under the present law, the 
High Court's jurisdiction in such matters is merely advisory on 
questions of law. For this purpose, the Appellate Tribunal has 
to draw up a statement of the case and refer the same to the 
High Court for its opinion. After the High Court delivers its 
judgment on the reference, the matter goes back to the 
Tribunal, which has then to pass such orders as are necessary 
to dispose of the case conformably to such judgment. Under 
this procedure, the aggrieved party before the Tribunal has to 
file an application seeking a reference to the High Court on 
specified questions of law arising out of the Tribunal's order. 
The hearing of such application by the Tribunal, followed by 
the drawing up of the statement of the case to the High Court, 
delays the consideration of the issue by the High Court for a 
considerable time. Where the Tribunal refuses to state the case 
as sought by the applicant, then again, the law provides for a 
direct approach to the High Court for issue of directions to the 
Appellate Tribunal to state the case to the High Court on the 
relevant question of law. This process also delays the 
consideration of the matter by the High court for quite some 
time. In addition to these types of delay, there will be further 
delays after the High Court decides the matter, as the Tribunal 
has to pass consequential orders disposing of the case, before 
the relief, if any due, can be granted to the assessee. 
II-6.20. In our view, the disposal of tax litigation can be 
speeded up considerably by vesting jurisdiction in the proposed 
Central Tax Court to hear appeals against the orders of the 
Tribunal on questions of law arising out of such orders. We, 
accordingly, recommend that the jurisdiction of the Central 

267 


Page 268 

Tax Court should be Appellate and not advisory. We also 
recommend that appeals before the Central Tax Court should 
be heard by a Bench of two judges. The judgment of a division 
Bench should be binding on other division Benches of the Tax 
Court unless it is contrary to a decision of the Supreme Court 
or of a full Bench of the Tax Court. 
II-6.21. 
In the matter of appeals before the Central Tax 
Court, it would be necessary to make a special provision for 
enabling Chartered Accountants to appear on behalf of 
appellants or respondents to argue the appeals before it. Legal 
practitioners would, in any event, be entitled to appear before 
the Central Tax Court. In addition, any other person, who may 
be permitted by the Court to appear before it, may also 
represent the appellant or the respondent in tax matters. 
II-6.22. 
Our recommendation for setting up of a Central 
Tax Court may not be interpreted to be only a modified version 
of the concept of administrative and other tribunals authorized 
to be set up for various purposes under the amendments 
effected by the 42 nd Amendment of the Constitution. The 
Central Tax Court, which we have in view, will be a special 
kind of High court with functional jurisdiction over tax matters 
and enjoying judicial independence in the same manner as the 
High Courts. 
The controversy generated by the 42 nd 
Amendment to the Constitution should not, therefore, be held to 
militate against the proposal for the establishment of a Central 
Tax Court to exercise the functions of a High Court in tax 
matters." 
This recommendation was not acceded to by Parliament. 

31. It is obvious, that substantial questions of law which relate to taxation 

would also involve many areas of civil and criminal law, for example Hindu 

Joint Family Law, partnership, sale of goods, contracts, Mohammedan Law, 

Company Law, Law relating to Trusts and Societies, Transfer of Property, 

Law relating to Intellectual Property, Interpretation of Statutes and sections 

dealing with prosecution for offences. It is therefore not correct to say that 

268 


Page 269 

taxation, being a specialized subject, can be dealt with by a tribunal. All 

substantial questions of law have under our constitutional scheme to be 

decided by the superior courts and the superior courts alone. Indeed, one of 

the objects for enacting the National Tax Tribunals Act, as stated by the 

Minister on the floor of the House, is that the National Tax Tribunal can lay 

down the law for the whole of India which then would bind all other 

authorities and tribunals. This is a direct encroachment on the High Courts' 

power under Art. 227 to decide substantial questions of law which would 

bind all tribunals vide East India Commercial Co. case, supra. 

32. In fact, it is a little surprising that the National Tax Tribunal is 

interposed between the appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court for the 

very good reason that ultimately it will only be the Supreme Court that will 

declare the law to be followed in future. As the appellate tribunal is already a 

second appellate court, it would be wholly unnecessary to have a National 

Tax Tribunal decide substantial questions of law in case of conflicting 

decisions of High Courts and Appellate Tribunals as these would ultimately 

be decided by the Supreme Court itself, which decision would under Article 

141 be binding on all tax authorities and tribunals. Secondly, in all tax 

matters, the State is invariably a party and the High Court is ideally situated 

to decide substantial questions of law which arise between the State and 

269 


Page 270 

private persons, being constitutionally completely independent of executive 

control. The same cannot be said of tribunals which, as L. Chandra Kumar 

states, will have to be under a nodal ministry as tribunals are not under the 

supervisory jurisdiction of the High Courts. 

33. Indeed, other constitutions which are based on the Westminster model, 

like the British North America Act which governs Canada have held 

likewise. In Attorney General for Quebec v. Farrah (1978), Vol.86 DLR 

[3d] 161 a transport tribunal was given appellate jurisdiction over the Quebec 

Transport Commission. The tribunal performed no function other than 

deciding questions of law. Since this function was ultimately performed only 

by superior courts, the impugned section was held to be unconstitutional. 

This judgment was followed in Re. Residential Tenancies Act, 123 DLR 

(3d) 554. This judgment went further, and struck down the Residential 

Tenancy Act which established a tribunal to require landlords and tenants to 

comply with the obligations imposed under the Act. The court held: 

"The Court of Appeal delivered a careful and scholarly 
unanimous judgment in which each of these questions was 
answered in the negative. The Court concluded it was not 
within the legislative authority of Ontario to empower the 
Residential Tenancy Commission to make eviction orders and 
compliance orders as provided in the Residential Tenancies 
Act, 1979. The importance of the issue is reflected in the fact 
that five Judges of the Court, including the Chief Justice and 
Associate Chief Justice, sat on the appeal." 

270 


Page 271 

It then went on to enunciate a three steps test with which we are not 

directly concerned. The Court finally concluded: 

"Implicit throughout the argument advanced on behalf of the 
Attorney-General of Qntario is the assumption that the Court 
system is too cumbersome, too expensive and therefore unable 
to respond properly to the social needs which the residential 
Tenancies Act, 1979 is intended to meet. All statutes respond 
to social needs. The Courts are unfamiliar with equity and the 
concept of fairness, justice, convenience, reasonableness. 
Since the enactment in1976 of the legislation assuring 
"security of tenure" the Country Court Judges of Ontario have 
been dealing with matters arising out of that legislation, 
apparently with reasonable dispatch, as both landlords and 
tenants in the present proceedings have spoken clearly against 
transfer of jurisdiction in respect of eviction and compliance 
orders from the Courts to a special commission. It is perhaps 
also of interest that there is no suggestion in the material filed 
with us that the Law Reforms Commission favoured removal 
from the Courts of the historic functions performed for over 
100 years by the Courts. 
I am neither unaware of, nor unsympathetic to, the 
arguments advanced in support of a view that s.96 should not 
be interpreted so as to thwart or unduly restrict the future 
growth of provincial administrative tribunals. Yet, however 
worthy the policy objectives, must be recognized that we, as a 
Court, are not given the freedom to choose whether the 
problem is such that provincial, rather than federal, authority 
should deal with it. We must seek to give effect to the 
Constitution as we understand it and with due regard for the 
manner in which it has been judicially interpreted in the past. 
If the impugned power is violative of s.96 it must be struck 
down." 

34. In Hins v. The Queen Director of Public Prosecutions v Jackson 

Attorney General of Jamaica (intervener) 1976 (1) All ER 353, the Privy 

Council had to decide a matter under the Jamaican Constitution. A Gun 

271 


Page 272 

Courts Act, 1974 was passed by the Jamaican Parliament in which it set up 

various courts. A question similar to the question posed in the instant case 

was decided thus: 

"All constitutions on the Westminister model deal under 
separate chapter heading with the legislature, the executive 
and the judicature. The chapter dealing with the judicature 
invariably contains provisions dealing with the method of 
appointment and security of tenure of the members of the 
judiciary which are designed to assure to them a degree of 
independence from the other two branches of government. It 
may, as in the case of Constitution of Ceylon, contain nothing 
more. To the extent to which the constitution itself is silent as 
to the distribution of the plenitude of judicial power between 
various courts it is implicit that it shall continue to be 
distributed between and exercised by the courts that were 
already in existence when the new constitution came into force; 
but the legislature, in exercise of its power to make laws for the 
'peace, order and good government of the state, may provide 
for the establishment of new courts and for the transfer to them 
of the whole or part of the jurisdiction previously exercisable 
by an existing court. What, however, is implicit in the very 
structure of a constitution on the Westminister model is that 
judicial power, however it be distributed from time to time 
between various courts, is to continue to be vested in persons 
appointed to hold judicial office in the manner and on the terms 
laid down in the chapter dealing with the judicature, even 
though this not expressly stated in the constitution (Liyanage v. 
R [1966] All ER 650 at 658 [1976] AC 259 at 287, 288] 
The more recent constitutions on the Westminister 
model, unlike their earlier prototypes, include a chapter 
dealing with fundamental rights and freedoms. The provisions 
of this chapter form part of the substantive law of the state and 
until amended by whatever special procedure is laid down in 
the constitution for this purpose, impose a fetter on the exercise 
by the legislature, the executive and the judiciary of the 
plenitude of their respective powers. The remaining chapters 
of the constitutions are primarily concerned not with the 

272 


Page 273 

legislature, the executive and the judicatures as abstractions, 
but with the persons who shall be entitled collectively or 
individually to exercise the plenitude of legislative, executive or 
judicial powers -their qualifications for legislative, executive 
or judicial office, the method of selecting them, their tenure of 
office, the procedure to be followed where powers are 
conferred on a class of persons acting collectively and the 
majorities required for the exercise of these powers. Thus, 
where a constitution on the Westminister model speaks of a 
particular 'court' already in existence when the constitution 
comes into force, it uses this expression as a collective 
description of all those individual judges who, whether sitting 
alone or with other judges or with a jury, are entitled to 
exercise the jurisdiction exercised by that court before the 
constitution came into force. Any express provision in the 
constitution for the appointment or security of tenure of judges 
of that court will apply to all individual judges subsequently 
appointed to exercise an analogous jurisdiction, whatever other 
name may be given to the 'court' in which they sit (Attorney 
General for Ontario v. attorney General for Canada.) 
Where, under a constitution on the Westminister model, 
a law is made by the parliament which purports to confer 
jurisdiction on a court described by a new name, the question 
whether the law conflicts with the provisions of the constitution 
dealing with the exercise of the judicial power does not depend 
on the label (in the instant case 'The Gun Court') which the 
parliament attaches to the judges when exercising the 
jurisdiction conferred on them by the law whose 
constitutionality is impugned. It is the substance of the law that 
must be regarded, not the form. What is the nature of the 
jurisdiction to be exercised by the judges who are to compose 
the court to which the new label is attached? Does the method 
of their appointment and the security of their tenure conform to 
the requirements of the constitution applicable to judges who, 
at the time the constitution came into force, exercised 
jurisdiction of that nature? (Attorney General for Australia v. R 
and Boilermakers' Society of Australia)." 

273 


Page 274 

35. Ultimately, a majority of the court found that the provisions of the 

1974 Act, in so far as they provide for the establishment of a full court 

division of the Gun Court consisting of three resident Magistrates were 

unconstitutional. 

36. It was also argued by the learned Attorney General that the High 

Courts' jurisdiction under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act and other 

similar tax laws could be taken away by ordinary law and such sections could 

be deleted. If that is so surely the jurisdiction vested in the High Court by the 

said section can be transferred to another body. 

37. It is well settled that an appeal is a creature of statute and can be done 

away by statute. The question posed here is completely different and the 

answer to that question is fundamental to our jurisprudence: that a 

jurisdiction to decide substantial questions of law vests under our 

constitution, only with the High Courts and the Supreme Court, and cannot 

be vested in any other body as a core constitutional value would be impaired 

thereby. 

38. In fact, the Attorney General in his written argument at paras 16 and 

21(a) has stated before us: 

"16. It is submitted that the present Act does not take away the 
power of judicial superintendence of the High Court under 
Article 227. Direct appeal to the Supreme Court from the 
decisions of a tribunal of first instance is an acceptable form of 

274 


Page 275 

judicial scrutiny. Provision for direct appeal to Supreme Court 
from the decision of a tribunal can be purely on questions of 
law as well. Since the High Court as a rule does not exercise its 
power of judicial superintendence when an appeal is provided 
to the Supreme Court, the power of judicial superintendence of 
the High Court over the tribunal stands curtailed in such cases 
as well. But this curtailment does not violate the rule of law as 
a court of law i.e. the Supreme Court continues to be the final 
interpreter of the law. By the same analogy a decision of an 
appellate tribunal with unrestricted right of appeal to the 
Supreme Court will not curtail the power of High Court under 
227 as recourse to the High Court under Articles 226/227 
would still be available if the tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction 
or violates the principles of natural justice or commits such 
other transgressions. 
21. (a) The present Act provides ample scope for judicial 
scrutiny in the form of an Appeal under Section 24 of the Act 
and also under Articles 226/227, Article 32 and Article 136 of 
the Constitution." 

39. On reading the above argument, it is clear that even according to this 

argument, the High Court's power of judicial review under Articles 226/227 

has in fact been supplanted by the National Tax Tribunal, something which 

L. Chandrakumar said cannot be done. See Para 93 of L. Chandra Kumar's 

case quoted above. In State of West Bengal v. Committee for Protection of 

Democratic Rights, 2010 (3) SCC 571, a Constitution Bench of this Court 

held: 

"39. It is trite that in the constitutional scheme adopted in 
India, besides supremacy of the Constitution, the separation of 
powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary 
constitutes the basic features of the Constitution. In fact, the 
importance of separation of powers in our system of 
governance was recognised in Special Reference No. 1 of 

275 


Page 276 

1964 [AIR 1965 SC 745 : (1965) 1 SCR 413] , even before the 
basic structure doctrine came to be propounded in the 
celebrated case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of 
Kerala [(1973) 4 SCC 225] , wherein while finding certain 
basic features of the Constitution, it was opined that separation 
of powers is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. 
Later, similar view was echoed in Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj 
Narain [1975 Supp SCC 1] and in a series of other cases on the 
point. Nevertheless, apart from the fact that our Constitution 
does not envisage a rigid and strict separation of powers 
between the said three organs of the State, the power of judicial 
review stands entirely on a different pedestal. Being itself part 
of the basic structure of the Constitution, it cannot be ousted or 
abridged by even a constitutional amendment. (See L. Chandra 
Kumar v. Union of India [(1997) 3 SCC 261 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 
577] .) Besides, judicial review is otherwise essential for 
resolving the disputes regarding the limits of constitutional 
power and entering the constitutional limitations as an ultimate 
interpreter of the Constitution." 
"68. Thus, having examined the rival contentions in the context 
of the constitutional scheme, we conclude as follows: 
(iii) In view of the constitutional scheme and the jurisdiction 
conferred on this Court under Article 32 and on the High 
Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution the power of 
judicial review being an integral part of the basic structure of 
the Constitution, no Act of Parliament can exclude or curtail 
the powers of the constitutional courts with regard to the 
enforcement of fundamental rights. As a matter of fact, such a 
power is essential to give practicable content to the objectives 
of the Constitution embodied in Part III and other parts of the 
Constitution. Moreover, in a federal constitution, the 
distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the 
State Legislature involves limitation on legislative powers and, 
therefore, this requires an authority other than Parliament to 
ascertain whether such limitations are transgressed. Judicial 
review acts as the final arbiter not only to give effect to the 
distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the 
State Legislatures, it is also necessary to show any 
transgression by each entity. Therefore, to borrow the words of 
Lord Steyn, judicial review is justified by combination of "the 

276

principles of separation of powers, rule of law, the principle of 
constitutionality and the reach of judicial review." 

40. In Proprietary Articles Trades Association v. Attorney General for 

Canada, 1931 AC 311, Lord Atkin said: 

"Their Lordships entertain no doubt that time alone will not 
validate an Act which when challenged is found to be ultra 
vires; nor will a history of a gradual series of advances till this 
boundary is finally crossed avail to protect the ultimate 
encroachment." At Pg 317. 

41. Chandra Kumar and R. Gandhi have allowed tribunalization at the 

original stage subject to certain safeguards. The boundary has finally been 

crossed in this case. I would, therefore, hold that the National Tax Tribunals 

Act is unconstitutional, being the ultimate encroachment on the exclusive 

domain of the superior Courts of Record in India.
