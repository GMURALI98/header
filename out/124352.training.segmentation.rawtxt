A 
Introduction 

1 
The genesis of this suo motu writ petition is in an order dated 22 April 

2021. This Court took note of the unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the 

country, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notices were issued 

to the Union of India 1 , the Governments of the States and Union Territories 2 , and 

to several petitioners who were before the High Courts. The Court observed: 

"the Union Government, the State Governments/Union 
Territories and the parties, who appeared to have approached 
the High Courts to show cause why uniform orders be not 
passed by this Court in relation to 
a) Supply of oxygen; 
b) Supply of essential drugs; 
c) Method and manner of vaccination; and 
d) Declaration of lockdown" 

The Court directed the Central Government to : 

"1. Report on the existence or otherwise and requirement of 
setting up of a coordinating body that would consider 
allocation of the above resources in a consultative manner 
(with the involvement of concerned States and Union 
Territories). 
2. Consider declaration of essential medicines and medical 
equipment including the above articles as essential 
commodities in relation to COVID. 
3. In respect of coordination of logistical support for inter-State 
and intra-State transportation and distribution of the above 
resources." 

2 
The Court also had appointed an Amicus Curiae to assist it. However, the 

Amicus Curiae was, on his request, relieved of his position on 23 April 2021. 

Hearings in the matter were then conducted on 27 April 2021, where the Court 

appointed two new Amici: Mr Jaideep Gupta and Ms Meenakshi Arora, learned 

Senior Counsel. They will be assisted by Mr Kunal Chatterjee and Mr Mohit Ram, 

1 "UOI", referred interchangeably as "Central Government" 
2 Collectively referred as "State Government"

learned counsel and Advocate-on-Record. The Court began the hearing by 

noting that the jurisdiction it assumed under Article 32 did not automatically lead 

to the erosion of a High Court"s jurisdiction under Article 226. Rather, the Court 

stressed on the importance of the jurisdiction under Article 226, and how High 

Courts may be better equipped to deal with issues within their own States. 

However, this Court assumed jurisdiction over issues in relation to COVID-19 

which traverse beyond state boundaries and affect the nation in its entirety. 

3 
The Court noted that it was in receipt of an affidavit dated 23 April 2021 

filed by the UOI. However, the Court directed the UOI to file an additional affidavit 

and the respective governments of the States/Union Territories to file fresh 

affidavits on four issues. The relevant extract of the order reads thus: 

"(i) Supply of oxygen -The Court should be apprised by the 
Union of India on 
(a) The projected demand for oxygen in the country at the 
present point of time and in the foreseeable future; 
(b) The steps taken and proposed to augment the availability 
of oxygen, meeting both the current and projected 
requirements; 
(c) The monitoring mechanism for ensuring the supply of 
oxygen, particularly to critically affected States and Union 
Territories as well as the other areas; 
(d) The basis on which allocation of oxygen is being made 
from the central pool; and 
(e) The methodology adopted for ensuring that the 
requirements of the States are communicated to the Central 
Government on a daily basis so as to ensure that the 
availability of oxygen is commensurate with the need of each 
State or, as the case may be, Union Territory. 

(ii) Enhancement of critical medical infrastructure, including 
the availability of beds, Covid treatment centres with duly 
equipped medical personnel on the basis of the projected 
requirement of healthcare professionals and anticipated 
requirements. The Union government will consider framing a 
policy specifying the standards and norms to be observed for 
admitting patients to hospitals and covid centres and the 
modalities for admission; 


PART A 

5 

(iii) The steps taken to ensure due availability of essential 
drugs, including Remdesivir and Favipiravir among other 
prescribed drugs and the modalities which have been set up 
for controlling prices of essential drugs, for preventing 
hoarding and for ensuring proper communication of the 
requirements at the level of each District by the District health 
authorities or Collectors to the Health Departments of the 
States and thereafter by the states to the Union Ministry of 
Health and Family Welfare so that the projected requirements 
are duly met and effectively monitored on a daily basis. 

(iv) Vaccination 
(a) Presently two vaccinations have been made available in 
the country, namely, Covishield and Covaxin; 
(b) As of date, the vaccination programme has extended to all 
citizens of the age of 45 years and above; 
(c) From 1 May 2021, the vaccination programme is to be 
opened up also to persons between the age groups of 18 to 
45, in addition to the existing age group categories. The Union 
of India shall clarify (i) the projected requirement of vaccines 
as a result of the enhancement of coverage; (ii) the modalities 
proposed for ensuring that the deficit in the availability of 
vaccines is met; (iii) steps proposed for enhancement of 
vaccine availability by sourcing stocks from within and outside 
the country; (iv) modalities for administering the vaccines to 
meet the requirements of those in the older age group (forty 
five and above) who have already received the first dose; (v) 
modalities fixed for administering the vaccine to meet the 
additional demand of the 18-45 population; (vi) how the 
supplies of vaccines will be allocated between various states if 
each state is to negotiate with vaccine producers; and (vii) 
steps taken and proposed for ensuring the procurement of 
other vaccines apart from Covishield and Covaxin and the 
time frame for implementation; and 
(d) The basis and rationale which has been adopted by the 
Union government in regard to the pricing of vaccines. The 
government shall explain the rationale for differential pricing in 
regard to vaccines sourced by the Union government on one 
hand and the states on the other hand when both sources 
lead to the distribution of vaccines to citizens." 

4 
This Court then received an additional affidavit dated 29 April 2021 from 

the UOI, and fresh affidavits by the various States/UTs addressing the four issues 

mentioned in its order dated 27 April 2021. In the hearing conducted on 30 April 

2021, this Court heard submissions by Mr Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor 


PART A 

6 

General of India, who was appearing on behalf of the Central Government. 

Several other counsels have made brief interjections, including Mr Vikas Singh, 

Senior Counsel and President of the Supreme Court Bar Association. This Court 

also heard a presentation on oxygen supply in India by Ms Sumita Dawra, 

Additional Secretary, Department of Promotion of Industry and International 

Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. As such, unless specified otherwise, 

the directions and observations in the present order are limited to the UOI. 

5 
During the course of the hearing, this Court directed that the individual 

States/UTs shall be given an opportunity to discuss their affidavits at a later 

hearing. Further, the Court also directed the learned Amici to prepare a tabular 

compilation in relation to all the Interlocutory Applications which have been filed 

in this petition. On the basis of the issues raised, they shall also be considered in 

a later hearing. Before delving into a substantive discussion, we would like to 

clarify that the jurisdiction exercised in this matter is merely to facilitate a dialogue 

of relevant stakeholders, the UOI, the States and this Court, in light of the 

pressing humanitarian crisis, and not with a view to usurp the role of the 

executive and the legislature. This bounded-deliberative approach 3 is exercised 

so that the UOI and States can justify the rationale behind their policy approach 

which must be bound by the human rights framework which presently implicates 

the right to life under Article 21 and right to equality under Article 14 of the 

Constitution.

B 
Outline of the Disaster Management Act 

6 
The Disaster Management Act, 2005 4 came into effect on 26 December 

2005. The DMA provides for the effective management of disasters and matters 

connected or incidental to such disasters. COVID-19 falls under the definition of a 

disaster under Section 2(d) 5 of the DMA and the provisions of the DMA were 

invoked for the first time to deal with the present pandemic. Under Section 6(2)(i) 

of the DMA, the National Disaster Management Authority 6 issued an order dated 

24 March 2020 directing the Ministries, UOI, State/UTs and their authorities to 

take effective measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 

Thereafter, the Home Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs as the Chairperson of 

the National Executive Committee, which assists the NDMA in its functions, in an 

order dated 24 March 2020 issued guidelines for the initial 21 days" lockdown on 

account of COVID-19. 

7 
Section 2(e) defines disaster management as a continuous and integrated 

process of planning, organizing, coordinating and implementing measures in 

relation to the disaster. Section 2(e) provides: 

"2… 
(e)"disaster management" means a continuous and integrated 
process of planning, organizing, coordinating and 
implementing measures' which are necessary or expedient 
for--
(i) prevention of danger or threat of any disaster; 
(ii) mitigation or reduction of risk of any disaster or its' severity 
or consequences; 
(iii) capacity-building; 

4 "DMA" 
5 ""2…(d) "disaster" means a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural 
or man-made causes, or by accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or 
damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature or 
magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area;" 
6 "NDMA" 


PART B 

8 

(iv) preparedness to deal with any disaster; 
(v) prompt response to any threatening disaster situation or 
disaster; 
(vi) assessing the severity or magnitude of effects of any 
disaster; 
(vii) evacuation, rescue and relief; 
(viii) rehabilitation and reconstruction;.." 

Section 2(n) of DMA defines a "National Plan" as the plan for disaster 

management for the whole country prepared under Section 11 of DMA. Section 3 

of the DMA constitutes the NDMA with the Prime Minister as the Chairperson, ex 

officio. Section 6 lists down the powers and functions of the NDMA. Under 

Section 6(2)(b), NDMA has the power to approve the National Plan. Section 11 of 

the DMA provides the procedure for drawing up and implementation of the 

National Plan in the following terms: 

"11. National Plan 
(1) There shall be drawn up a plan for disaster management 
for the whole of the country to be called the National Plan. 
(2) The National Plan shall be prepared by the National 
Executive Committee having regard to the National Policy and 
in consultation with the State Governments and expert bodies 
or organisations in the field of disaster management to be 
approved by the National Authority. 
(3) The National Plan shall include--
(a) measures to be taken for the prevention of 
disasters, or the mitigation of their effects; 
(b) measures to be taken for the integration of 
mitigation measures in the development plans; 
(c) measures to be taken for preparedness and 
capacity building to effectively respond to any 
threatening disaster situations or disaster; 
(d) roles and responsibilities of different Ministries or 
Departments of the Government of India in respect of 
measures specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c). 
(4) The National Plan shall be reviewed and updated annually. 
(5) Appropriate provisions shall be made by the Central 
Government for financing the measures to be carried out 
under the National Plan. 
(6) Copies of the National Plan referred to in sub-sections (2) 
and (4) shall be made available to the Ministries or 
Departments of the Government of India and such Ministries 


PART B 

9 

or Departments shall draw up their own plans in accordance 
with the National Plan." 

8 
A National Plan includes, inter alia, measures for disaster prevention, 

mitigation, preparedness and roles and responsibilities of different Ministries in 

terms of Section 11(3) of DMA. A National Plan for the entire country was 

prepared in the year 2016 and was revised and notified in November, 2019. The 

National Plan, 2019 provides a framework to the Government agencies to deal 

with different aspects of disaster management. Section 11(4) of the DMA 

provides that the National Plan is to be revised and updated annually making it a 

"dynamic document". The executive summary of the National Plan succinctly 

captures its purpose and contours in the below extract: 

"...The National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) provides 
a framework and direction to the government agencies for all 
phases of disaster management cycle. The NDMP is a 
"dynamic document" in the sense that it will be periodically 
improved keeping up with the emerging global best practices 
and knowledge base in disaster management. It is in 
accordance with the provisions of the DM Act, 2005, the 
guidance given in the National Policy on Disaster 
Management (NPDM) 2009, and the established national 
practices..." 

9 
Section 12 of the DMA empowers the NDMA to recommend guidelines for 

the minimum standard of relief to be provided to persons affected by disaster. 

NDMA can create guidelines stipulating minimum standards of relief for providing 

ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life and restoration of means of 

livelihood in terms of Section 12(iii) of DMA. In light of the human suffering and 

loss of livelihood that has accompanied this pandemic, NDMA may consider 

laying down minimum standards of relief in this regard. We clarify that this is not 


PART B 

10 

a direction of this Court, however a suggestion that can be looked into by the 

NDMA. Under Section 12(iv) of the DMA, the NDMA has been given wide powers 

to provide guidelines for any such relief that may be necessary. 

10 
In addition to the above provisions, Section 35 of the DMA empowers the 

Central Government to take measures which it deems to be necessary or 

expedient for the purpose of disaster management. Section 35(2)(a) provides for 

coordination of actions between the Central Government and State Governments 

and their respective authorities in relation to disaster management. Section 

35(2)(e) obliges the Central Government to assist and cooperate with the State 

Governments as requested by them or otherwise deemed appropriate by it. 

11 
Section 36 of DMA provides for the responsibilities that have to be 

undertaken by the Ministries or Departments of the Central Government. While 

Section 36(h) empowers the Central Government to take any actions that it may 

consider necessary for disaster management, Section 36(d) specifically enables 

it to review its policies with a view to incorporate provisions necessary for 

prevention of disaster, mitigation or preparedness. Under Section 36(f), it is the 

responsibility of every Ministry or Department of Central Government to provide 

assistance to the State Governments for (i) drawing up mitigation, preparedness 

and response plans, capacity-building, data collection and identification and 

training of personnel in relation to disaster management; (iii) carrying out rescue 

and relief operations in the affected area; (iii) assessing the damage from any 

disaster; and (iv) carrying out rehabilitation and reconstruction. Section 35(g) 

provides that the Central Government is responsible for making available its 

resources to the National Executive Committee or a State Executive Committee 


PART B 

11 

for the purposes of, inter alia, transporting personnel and relief goods to and from 

the affected area. 

12 
The provisions of Sections 35 and 36 of the DMA that have been 

discussed above have been enacted in the spirit of cooperative federalism in 

order to ensure that Central Government can assist and enable the State 

Governments to effectively tackle the disaster in question. 

13 
The learned Solicitor General has submitted that the Central Government 

is operating under the broad framework of the National Plan and the plan is 

already in force. The plan specifically deals with "Biological and Public Health 

Emergencies". Further, different States have their own Disaster Management 

Plans in place. It has been submitted that the National Plan does not and cannot 

contain step by step instructions or specific directions for the day to day 

management of the pandemic by the Government agencies. Such aspects are 

kept open for executive decision, in view of the dynamic nature of the disaster in 

question. Further, since COVID-19 is a novel virus, the knowledge in relation to 

such a virus is contemporaneous in nature and is subject to constant 

development. A three Judge bench of this Court in its judgement in Centre for 

Public Interest Litigation vs Union of India 7 had noted that there was no need 

to develop a fresh National Plan under Section 11 for COVID-19 since a National 

Plan was already in place, which was being supplemented by various orders and 

measures taken by competent authorities under DMA. Justice Ashok Bhushan, 

speaking for this Court, observed that: 

7 2020 SCC OnLine SC 652 


PART C 

12 

"40. The Disaster Management Act, 2005 contain ample 
powers and measures, which could be taken by the National 
Disaster Management Authority, National Executive 
Committee and Central Government to prepare further plans, 
guidelines and Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs), which 
in respect to COVID-19 had been done from time to time. 
Containment Plan for Novel Coronavirus, 2019 had been 
issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government 
of India. There were no lack of guidelines, SOPs and Plan to 
contain COVID-19, by Nodal Ministry had been brought on 
record issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 
Government of India, i.e., Updated Containment Plan for 
Large Outbreaks Novel Coronavirus Disease, 2019 (COVID-
19)." 

14 
Therefore, the National Plan, 2019 can be supplemented by the issuance 

of additional guidelines to tackle any aspect of disaster management including 

the issue of admission to hospitals and access to essential drugs and vaccines in 

respect of COVID-19. 

C 
Medical Infrastructure 

C.1 Submissions in UOI's Affidavits 

15 
In relation to the broad issue of medical infrastructure, the Central 

Government begins its affidavit dated 23 April 2021 and additional affidavit dated 

29 April 2021 by describing its "three-tier setup" of Covid Care Centers 8 , 

Dedicated COVID Health Centers 9 and Dedicated COVID Hospitals 10 which was 

recommended to the States for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, for which the 

UOI also provided funds under an emergency response package from the 

National Health Mission and State Disaster Response Fund. 

8 "CCC" 
9 "DCHC" 
10 "DCH" 


PART C 

13 

16 
The present status of these is: (i) 2,084 DCH (of which 89 are under the 

Central Government and the rest 1,995 with State Governments); (ii) 4,043 

DCHC; and (iii) 12,673 CCC. Cumulatively, they have 18,52,265 beds in total, out 

of which 4,68,974 beds are in DCH. It was also noted that Central Government 

hospitals have also been converted into DCH. 

17 
Further, tertiary care hospitals under ESIC, Defence, Railways, 

paramilitary forces, Steel Ministry, et al, are also being leveraged for case 

management. Even as many as 3816 railways coaches spread over 16 railway 

zones have been converted into CCC. Finally, the DRDO has also set up large 

field hospitals with capacities ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 isolation beds. 

18 
It was noted that through coordination between Central Government and 

State Governments, isolation beds (with/without oxygen) were increased to 

around 15.7 lakhs, as compared to 10,180 before the first lockdown; similarly, 

ICU beds were increased to more than 85,000, as compared to 2,168 before the 

first lockdown. Similar upgrades were provided to necessary equipment such as 

Ventilators, N95 masks and PPEs. 

19 
The affidavit provides the following details of the efforts taken by UOI to 

create projections for each State, and how it was communicated to them: 

(i) 
It has developed an IT module for projections of expected cases based on 

ongoing caseload, so as to alert States and districts to be prepared in 

advance. The projections by the Central Government were regularly 

shared in writing with the States, along with reports containing emergency 


PART C 

14 

plans. This tool was also made available to States, to map their own 

projections at the State level; 

(ii) 
Details of the meetings conducted by the Prime Minister, the Minister of 

Health and Family Welfare, the Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary (H) and 

the DGHS were provided; and 

(iii) 
Details of letters (which seem to have been sent on a monthly basis) sent 

by the Central Government to the State Governments indicate that they 

informed the State Governments of the projected cases for the coming 

month, along with the number of Oxygen Supported Beds, ICU Beds and 

of Ventilators that will be required to manage the projected cases. 

Thereby, the State Governments which were found lacking in their 

numbers were directed to ramp up their facilities. 

20 
In relation to the preparedness for the second wave of the COVID-19 

pandemic, the affidavits state that: 

(i) 
After the first wave, the Central Government has been consistently writing 

to the State Governments from 4 December 2020 with numbers of 

projected cases, along with the directions requiring them to arrange the 

necessary infrastructure which will be needed; 

(ii) 
State Governments were requested by the UOI to formulate a 

comprehensive plan in relation to: 

(a) Bed capacities, ICU beds, further identification of additional hospitals, 

preparation of field hospital facilities, ensuring sufficient oxygen 

supported beds and oxygen supplies; 


PART C 

15 

(b) Deployment of requisite HR training and mentoring of doctors and 

nurses for management of patients, strengthen ambulance services and 

centralized call center-based services for allocation of beds; 

(c) Suitable initiatives for (among other things) achieving and maintaining 

adequate level of testing, surveillance and risk communication for 

promoting wearing of masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene; 

(d) Sufficient referral linkages for districts with deficit infrastructure through 

deployment of additional ambulances, wherever necessary; and 

(iii) 
On 20 April 2021, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare 11 wrote to the 

State Governments with their projections and reminded them also of the 

funding avenues being made available to all States under NHM funding, 

State Disaster Response Fund, and other initiatives. 

21 
The affidavits also note that the Central Government had developed a live 

portal with all the States and districts where they were asked to feed in their data 

of cases and details such as people under home isolation, on isolation beds (with 

or without oxygen) and on ICU beds. Further, the State Governments were also 

directed to feed in details of the COVID dedicated health care infrastructure 

created by them, besides the details of containment zones so specified by them. 

However, the Central Government has alleged that States and districts did not 

upload their data regularly enough. Additionally, there was also a "Facility App" 

which could be used by Covid Health facilities to monitor their patients as well as 

the availability of logistics with their health facility. However, the Central 

11 "MoHFW" 


PART C 

16 

Government alleges that States, districts and facilities did not use this Facility 

App. 

C.2 National Policy for Admission in Hospitals 

22 
It has been submitted by the Central Government that health being a state 

subject, the medical infrastructure is largely created and maintained by the 

respective State Governments. Since we are yet to hear from the State 

Governments, we shall not be issuing any directions or making comprehensive 

observations in relation to this issue. 

23 
However, based on the affidavits submitted by the Central Government 

and the hearings which followed, we have come to understand that there is no 

national policy on how admissions must take place in the various tiers of 

hospitals (CCC, DCHC and DCH). Gaining admission into a hospital with a bed is 

one of the biggest challenges being faced by most individuals during this second 

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Left to their own devices, citizens have had to 

suffer immeasurable hardship. Different states and local authorities follow their 

own protocols. Differing standards for admission in different hospitals across the 

nation leads to chaos and uncertainty. The situation cannot brook any delay. 

Accordingly, we direct the Central Government to frame a policy in this regard, in 

exercise of its statutory powers under the DMA, which will be followed nationally. 

The presence of such a policy shall ensure that no one in need is turned away 

from a hospital, due to no fault of their own. Such a policy should, inter alia, 

address the following issues in relation to admission: 


PART C 

17 

(i) 
Requirement of a positive test for COVID-19 virus, which may become 

difficult for many individuals since testing facilities are overwhelmed, test 

results are taking inordinately long time and the new strain of the COVID-

19 virus is sometimes not even picked up by a regular RT-PCR test; 

(ii) 
Some patients are being refused service based on arbitrary factors. For 

example, the hospitals in Ahmedabad were initially refusing to take in 

patients who did not arrive in the government-run "108" ambulances. While 

this rule has now been removed, after objections were noted by the 

Gujarat High Court during hearings in a suo motu public interest litigation 12 , 

we note that such rules cannot be allowed to crop up in other places; 

(iii) 
Some reports have also been brought to our attention that hospitals are 

refusing to admit individuals who cannot produce a valid ID card which 

shows that they belong to the city where the hospital is located. Given how 

overstretched our hospitals are during the second wave of the COVID-19 

pandemic, it is entirely plausible that individuals may travel to other cities in 

desperation, since beds may not be available in their city. The rural health 

infrastructure is seriously deficient. Hence, no hospital should be allowed 

to deny them entry solely based on this reason or any other issues with 

identity proofs; 

(iv) 
A related issue is when individuals often get their family member admitted 

in a hospital in one city, but have to travel to another city to look for oxygen 

or essential drugs and are denied their use because they are to be bought 

12 Suo Motu vs State of Gujarat, R/Writ Petition (PIL) No 53 Of 2021 


PART C 

18 

for an individual admitted in a different city. As was true for the above such 

rule, this is also unacceptable and should not be allowed; 

(v) 
Admissions to hospital must be based on need. The Central Government, 

in consultation with the respective State Governments, must formulate 

guidelines on the stage at which hospitalization is required so as to ensure 

that scarce hospital beds are not occupied by persons who do not need 

hospitalization. This aspect should be based on the advice of medical 

experts and can be suitably altered given the needs of each State (or 

regions within the State) and in the course of the experiences gained 

during the pandemic; and 

(vi) 
Directions are hereby issued to all States, Union Territories, and all public 

agencies, to ensure that the above orders are implemented forthwith. The 

Central, State and Union Territory governments shall issue necessary 

orders and circulars, incorporating the above directions, within three days, 

which shall be in force till replaced by an appropriate uniform policy, 

devised by the central government, statutorily. 


PART D 

19 

D 
Oxygen allocation and availability 

24 
The Central Government has argued the following: 

(i) 
By its order dated 11 September 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs 13 , in 

exercise of its powers under Section 10(2)(h) of the DMA had constituted 

an Empowered Group-II as an inter-ministerial body to ensure availability of 

essential medical equipment and oxygen management; 

(ii) 
Medical oxygen is critical to treatment of COVID affected patients. The 

entire available capacity of oxygen is used for supply for industrial and 

medical use, which is in the form of Liquid Medical Oxygen 14 . The major 

suppliers for both industrial and medical oxygen are steel plants in the 

public and private sectors, and private entities; 

(iii) 
Oxygen is not produced evenly in India. While some States may be oxygen 

producing States such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Jharkhand; other 

States/UTs such as Delhi, Goa and Madhya Pradesh, do not have 

production capacity and rely on supply of oxygen from oxygen producing 

States; 

(iv) For an estimation of the required oxygen supply, an Empowered Group I 

was constituted which categorized patients into three categories: 

 Class I comprising of 80% of the cases which are mild and do not 

require oxygen; 

13 "MHA" 
14 "LMO" 


PART D 

20 

 Class II comprising of 17% cases which are moderate and can be 

managed on non-ICU beds and 50% of these may require oxygen 

@10L/min; and 

 Class III comprising of 3% of cases which are severe ICU cases 

requiring approximately 24L/min oxygen. 

(v) 
On the basis of the categorization provided by Empowered Group I, oxygen 

requirement of different States on the basis of active cases is being 

calculated which is around 8462 MT. Based on the trend of active cases, 

the "doubling rate of cases" is calculated for each State, which implies, the 

number of days in which COVID cases are likely to double. The number of 

active cases are projected on the basis of the doubling rate and oxygen 

requirement is calculated. These projections get changed daily on the basis 

of real time change; 

(vi) In order to ensure supply of oxygen to all States, a mapping exercise of the 

sources of supplies with the demand of medical oxygen to the critically 

affected States was undertaken jointly by the Department of Promotion of 

Industry and Internal Trade, MoHFW, Ministry of Steel, Petroleum and 

Explosives Safety Organisation, oxygen manufacturers etc. During the 

course of the mapping exercise, States were requested to indicate their 

projections for requirement of medical oxygen based on expected active 

case load. These projections were to be given as on 20 April, 25 April, and 

30 April 2021. The following was the forecast provided by the major States: 


PART D 

21 

(vii) Based on these projections, an indicative mapping framework was drawn 

up and approved by an order dated 15 April 2021, which provided the 

name of the supply point, the State to which supply was allocated and the 

quantity to be supplied. Subsequently, due to continuous changes in the 

number of cases and the need for medical oxygen, a revised projection 

was issued by States for 20 April 2021, which provided: 


PART D 

22 

(viii) Following this, a revised supply plan for medical oxygen to 15 States for 

meeting their demand was issued by an order dated 18 April 2021. Certain 

States, such as Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and 

Madhya Pradesh, faced challenges despite this allocation. Issues such as 

logistical bottlenecks in transportation, incidents of local authorities in 

disrupting supplies to other states were reported. Due to this, allocation 

orders were further amended by orders dated 21 April 2021, 22 April 2021, 

24 April 2021, 25 April 2021 and 26 April 2021. The MHA also issued 

orders dated 22 April 2021 and 25 April 2021 under the DMA to direct 

States/UTs to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen; 

(ix) The major principles on the basis of which the amendments were made 

were to: (a) ensure that projected requirement of LMO is allocated as far as 

possible; (b) allocate sources located within the State or closest to the 

State while balancing requirements from States which have no/low internal 


PART D 

23 

manufacturing capacity; (c) ensure feasible transportation; (d) ensure 

minimum disruptions in existing supply chains; 

(x) 
As an instance, the allocation summary for 28 April 2021 has been placed 

on record: 

(xi) After the Central Government procures and allocates the quantity of 

medical oxygen to each State, it is the State Government"s responsibility to 

arrange transportation to pick up their allotted quantity from the supply 

point; 

(xii) Given the fact that the mapping exercise has to be continuously updated 

according to the need of the situation across States, the Central 

Government also put in an interactive mechanism called the "Virtual 

Central Control Room" consisting of senior officers of Additional/Joint 

Secretary rank to monitor and find solutions to any problems that may arise 

on a real time basis. We have been apprised that the daily allocation of the 


PART D 

24 

supply of oxygen is sanctioned and uploaded on this virtual room, in which 

the Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs are members; 

(xiii) In addition to the management of supply and demand of medical oxygen, 

the Central Government has also taken the following steps to ensure 

augmentation of supply in the country: 

(a) Licenses to industrial gas manufacturers: By an order dated 7 April 

2020, the Drug Controller General of India 15 allowed licenses to be 

issued to industrial gas manufacturers for manufacturing medical 

oxygen within 24 hours of receipt of the application by DCGI; 

(b) Enhanced production of LMO in steel plants and by private 

manufacturers: Steps have been taken to reduce production of other 

liquid products which are required for manufacturing steel (such as 

argon and nitrogen) and enhance the capacity of liquid oxygen. This has 

resulted in immediate enhancement of 293 MT. Additionally, the steel 

sector has made available the liquid oxygen in its storage tanks (approx. 

16,000 MT as on 21 April 2021). Supplies have increased from 1000 MT 

in the first week of April 2021 to 2600 MT on 21 April 2021. Moreover, 

private manufacturers have also enhanced production of medical 

oxygen; 

(c) Restrictions on use of industrial oxygen: By an order dated 18 April 

2021, the MoHFW restricted industrial use of oxygen. Supply of oxygen 

for all industrial use was completely prohibited on 21 April 2021, except 

for certain industries such as ampoules and vials; pharmaceuticals; 

15 "DCGI" 


PART D 

25 

petroleum refineries; nuclear energy facilities; and oxygen cylinder 

manufacturers. These have added 1000 MT of additional oxygen; 

(d) Augmentation in availability of tankers: India has 1224 oxygen 

tankers (16732 MT capacity) and efforts are being made to increase this 

capacity to 2000 tankers through conversion of nitrogen and argon 

tankers and import of 138 cryogenic tankers; 

(e) Commissioning of PSA plants: Pressure Swing Absorption 16 is a 

technology to generate oxygen at a local level. PSA plants established 

in hospitals enable self-sufficiency in generation of oxygen. MoHFW is 

in the process of commissioning 162 PSA Plants (154 MT capacity). 

The following statistics have been furnished : 

Number of plants installed: 
38 

Number of plants to be installed by 30 April 2021 
21 

Number of plants to be installed by 31 May 2021 
105 

Number of plants to be installed by 30 June 2021 17 
51 

Number of PSA Plants for district headquarters 

(under planning) 

500 

(f) Import of medical oxygen: A global tender was floated to import 

50,000 MT of medical oxygen to be supplied in 90 days and quotations 

have been received. As an interim measure, quotations from bidders 

were called within 24 hours as to the quantities they could offer, prices 

etc. Orders have been placed with 2 foreign suppliers, i.e., SSB 

Cryogenic Equipment Ltd. for 200 MT and Gulf Industrial Gases Abu 

16 "PSA" 
17 As per the affidavit dated 23 April 2021, the UOI has stated that "a further 105 plants will be installed by 
31.05.2021 and thereafter increasing to 156 plants by 30.06.2021." 


PART D 

26 

Dhabi for 1800 MT. Another order is also being placed with M/s Ultra-

Pure Gases India for import of 500-1500 MT; 

(g) Augmentation of availability of cylinders: 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders 

were procured in April and May 2020 and distributed to States. Orders 

for additional 1,27,000 cylinders were placed on 21 April 2021. The 

Central Government proposes to address the additional demand 

through regulated portable oxygen system technology; 

(h) Setting up of jumbo container based COVID hospitals using 

gaseous oxygen: Apart from LMO, the gaseous oxygen production 

capacity in the steel sector is 43,000 MT per day against which 26,000 

MT per day is being produced. Two private entities, AMNS and JSW are 

setting up "Jumbo" COVID centres with 1000 bed oxygen facilities in 

Hazira, Vijayanagar and Dolvi using gaseous oxygen; and 

(i) Transportation by Air & Rail: Railways are being used for long 

distance transport of tankers through "roll on roll off" service and an 

"Oxygen Express" -a double engine train which gets a green corridor -

is being run from supply point to destination. As an instance, the first 

rake with 7 empty tankers reached Mumbai from Vizag to transport 105 

MT from RINL Vizag to Kalamboli. In addition to this, defence aircraft for 

carrying empty tankers to supply point are being deployed. However, it 

is technically not possible to bring in oxygen filed tankers in an aircraft. 

25 
During the course of the hearing, the Solicitor General has also sought to 

lay down the facts and figures pertaining to production and supply of oxygen, 

daily supply to States and challenges faced in supply chain logistics before the 


PART D 

27 

Court by means of a power point presentation. We note the submission of the 

Solicitor General that the figures given in the power point presentation are 

revised on a daily basis and that the presentation is not to be treated as a 

submission made on oath by the Solicitor General, which may give rise to a 

cause of action for litigation in future either before this Court or the High Courts. 

Ms Sumita Dawra, Additional Secretary, Department of Promotion of Industry and 

Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, who is one of the senior 

administrative officers in charge of oxygen procurement and supply coordination, 

has given an overview of these issues and made a presentation before us. We 

would like to record our appreciation for the contribution made by Ms Dawra and 

her team, who despite being infected by the COVID-19 virus, has continued to 

work and manage the supply of medical oxygen that the country so desperately 

needs today. It is through the earnest contribution of officers such as Ms Dawra, 

who are working round the clock, that the country is able to deal with the storm 

created by one of the worst humanitarian crises we have seen. 

26 
Based on the above facts and figures, the Solicitor General has stated that 

there is no dearth of oxygen supply in the country as on date and steps are being 

taken continuously to augment the supply of oxygen. Having said that, the 

Solicitor General has also admitted that there has been a shortage of supply to 

certain States and has attributed this shortage to various factors including the 

failure of State Governments to lift the allocated quantity of oxygen from the 

supply point; transportation bottlenecks caused by inter-State movement of 

tankers; and technical failure of certain plants leading to reassessment of 

allocation on a real time basis. 


PART D 

28 

27 
Submissions have also been made on the issue of supply of oxygen by Mr 

Rahul Mehra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Government of National 

Capital Territory of Delhi 18 . Mr Rahul Mehra submits that the GNCTD is facing an 

acute shortage of the supply of oxygen as it had been allocated a substantially 

lower quantity of oxygen as against its projected demand. Mr Mehra pointed out 

that initially as on 15 April 2021, the projected demand of GNCTD for 20 April 

2021 was 300 MT/day, for 25 April 2021 it was 349 MT/day, and for 30 April 2021 

it was 445 MT/day. However, due to a surge in cases, the projected demand was 

revised by GNCTD on 18 April 2021 to 700MT/day and this was immediately 

communicated to the Central Government. Despite the increase in projected 

demand, the supply of oxygen to GNCTD has continued in terms of the allocation 

order dated 25 April 2021, in which 490 MT/day were allocated. As against this 

as well, the manufacturers have only been able to supply 445 MT/day. Mr Mehra 

has clarified that as on the date of the hearing their demand was 700MT/day, 

however their projected demand for the coming days is stated to be 976 MT/day 

as the GNCTD has planned an increase in medical infrastructure, including beds 

with oxygen cylinders and beds for patients in intensive care unit. 

28 
Opposing his submission, the Solicitor General and Ms Dawra stated that 

no revised projections have been received from GNCTD till date. The Solicitor 

General has also sought to highlight that the government of GNCTD has failed to 

offtake the allocated quantity of oxygen from the supply point. 

29 
Having heard the submissions of both counsels on the issues pertaining to 

supply of oxygen to GNCTD, we note that the Central Government (on page 63) 

18 "GNCTD" 


PART D 

29 

in its affidavit dated 23 April 2021 has admitted that the projected demand for 

GNCTD as of 20 April 2021 had increased by 133% from 300 MT/day to 700 

MT/day. According to the figures of allocation given in the affidavit dated 23 April 

2021 and the presentation given by Ms Dawra, the existing allocation of GNCTD 

remains at 490 MT/day. This situation must be remedied forthwith. The situation 

on the ground in Delhi is heart rending. Recriminations between the Central 

Government (which contends that GNCTD has not lifted its allocated quantity) 

and GNCTD (which contends that despite its projected demand the quantity 

allocated has not been enhanced) can furnish no solace to citizens whose lives 

depend on a thin thread of oxygen being available. On the intervention of the 

Court during the hearing, the Solicitor General states that he has instructions to 

the effect that GNCTD"s demand of medical oxygen will be met and that the 

national capital will not suffer due to lack of oxygen. We issue a peremptory 

direction in those terms. In the battle of shifting responsibility of supplying/off-

taking of oxygen, lives of citizens cannot be put in jeopardy. The protection of the 

lives of citizens is paramount in times of a national crisis and the responsibility 

falls on both the Central Government and the GNCTD to cooperate with each 

other to ensure that all possible measures are taken to resolve the situation. 

Learned Senior Counsel for GNCTD has assured the court after taking 

instructions at the "highest" level that the issue will be resolved completely in a 

spirit of co-operation. During the course of the hearing, the Solicitor General has 

assured that henceforth he will ensure that the deficit of oxygen is rectified and 

supply is made to the GNCTD according to their projected demand (which may 

be revised in the future) on a day by day basis. We accept his submission and 


PART D 

30 

direct compliance within 2 days from the date of the hearing, that is, on or before 

midnight of 3 May 2021. 

30 
With regard to the issue of the supply and availability of medical oxygen for 

the entire country, we have noted that efforts are being made to augment the 

availability of oxygen. While the Central and State Governments are in the 

process of managing the supply of oxygen, at the same time, it is critical that a 

buffer emergency stock of oxygen is created so that in the event that the supply 

chain is disrupted to any one or more hospitals in an area for any reason, the 

buffer or emergency stocks can be used to avoid loss of human lives. These 

emergency stocks must be so distributed so as to be easily accessible without 

delay in every local area. We have also seen the situation that has developed in 

the last 24 hours in Delhi where patients, including among them medical 

professionals, died because of the disruption of supplies and the time lag in the 

arrival of tankers. This deficit shall be rectified immediately by the Central 

Government by creating buffer stocks and collaborating with the States through 

the virtual control room on a 24 by 7 basis. In view of the deaths which are being 

caused daily by the disruption of supplies, this direction is more crucial than ever. 

We therefore, direct the Central Government in collaboration with the States to 

prepare a buffer stock of oxygen to be used for emergency purposes to ensure 

supply lines continue to function even in unforeseen circumstances. The location 

of the emergency stocks shall be decentralised so as to be immediately available 

if the normal supply chain is disrupted to any hospital for any reason. The 

emergency stocks shall be created within the next four days. The replenishment 

of the emergency stocks will also be monitored on a real time basis through the 


PART D 

31 

virtual control room in active consultation with each state/UT. This is in addition to 

the day to day allocations. 

31 
In addition to the above, we direct the Central Government to consider the 

following suggestions, which may assist in increasing the availability of oxygen 

and ensure transparency of demand-supply management, and provide a 

clarification to this Court: 

(i) 
We understand that the Virtual Central Control Room of the Central 

Government displays the allocation of supply of oxygen by the Central 

Government to each State/UT. By extension of this, a mechanism for 

displaying real time updates of supply of oxygen from each State to 

hospitals in each district, along with the remaining stock of oxygen with the 

hospitals may be maintained and shared with the citizens to ensure 

transparency. This will also ensure that citizens can easily identify the 

hospitals where medical aid can be availed; 

(ii) 
The government shall clarify the steps being taken on planning on the use 

of oxygen concentrators to reduce the demand of LMO, such that LMO is 

needed only for critical patients. A comprehensive plan on augmenting the 

production/import of these oxygen concentrators may be considered; 

(iii) The expected supply of oxygen/containers to be received from outside 

India should be suitably augmented to cater to anticipated increases in the 

demand and shortfall of domestic availability. Pending the early finalization 

of the global tender a decision may be taken on the need to continue 

imports to bridge the gap in availability; and 


PART D 

32 

(iv) A review shall be made of any restrictions on inter-State travel of trucks or 

tankers carrying oxygen/other medical aid equipment (such as GST related 

issues, documentation) which might cause a hindrance in their movement. 

The Central Government may consider implementing a system to track and 

map the supply tankers which would allow better management of resources 

and allow diversion of resources from one State to the other in case of 

emergencies. 


PART E 

33 

E 
Vaccines 

32 
The previous order of this Court dated 27 April 2021 directed the Central 

Government to clarify, inter alia: (i) the projected availability of vaccines and 

proposed steps to boost supply and distribution; and (ii) the vaccine pricing and 

distribution among states. Upon perusing the affidavits filed by the Central 

Government and after having the benefit of oral arguments of the Solicitor 

General, we have arrived at the following understanding on the two broad issues 

outlined above. We would once again re-iterate that we do not attempt to delve 

into the role of the executive in designing policy choices. We are merely seeking 

to enter into a dialogue with the relevant stakeholders in order to ensure probity 

and transparency of the measures underway. We are cognizant that it is 

ultimately up to the executive to frame and implement policies that it deems 

appropriate, with the topmost regard to public interest. 

E.1 Vaccine capacity and disbursal 

33 
The Central Government has apprised us of its constitution of a National 

Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 19 on 7 August 2020 and 

operationalization of the immunization programme from December 2020. It was 

further stated that as of 26 April 2021, over 13.5 crore vaccine doses (approx. 9% 

of the Indian population) have been administered to Frontline Workers, 

Healthcare Workers and persons who are 45 years of age and higher in the 3 

Phases of immunization. It was submitted that these vaccines have been 

19 "NEGVAC" 


PART E 

34 

centrally procured and administered free of cost to the abovementioned groups 

who were identified based on specific vulnerabilities and a higher mortality rate 

on account of the COVID-19 infection. 

34 
On 20 April 2021, the Central Government rolled out a revised strategy of 

COVID-19 vaccination for all persons over 18 years of age, with effect from 1 

May 2021. This new age group consists of approximately 59 crore people, which 

would require 122 crore vaccine doses under the current two-dose vaccine 

regime of Covishield and Covaxin which have been authorized for emergency 

use in India. This revised strategy enables vaccine procurement by State 

Governments and private hospitals, purportedly for accelerating the immunization 

programme which is critical to curb the pandemic. In response to the query of this 

Court on the necessity of the revised strategy, the Central Government furnished 

the following justification: 

"During the ongoing consultation with the states, 
demands/concerns were raised by the various State 
Governments to expand the scope of vaccination drive to 
include the beneficiaries beyond the priority groups identified 
by NEGVAC as approved by Central Government. As a matter 
of co-operative federalism, it was felt necessary to allow play 
in the joints and to de-centralize vaccine procurement and to 
enable the States to expand vaccination drives to other 
groups between the age of 18-44 years. However, since the 
priority group as identified by Union of India (which had 
more vulnerability) was not fully vaccinated, it was 
considered imperative to carry out two drives separately 
i.e. in a decentralized manner to achieve higher efficiency 
and reach. Thus the States were given a participatory role 
to undertake the procurement of vaccine and for 
vaccination of any other 'groups identified drive' for the 
18-44 age group. This would also keep the existing drive 
of critical groups unobstructed as the 50 percent of the 
vaccines procured through the GoI channel would 
continue to support and provide free of cost vaccine to 
the most vulnerable age groups of 45 years plus in the 
country health care workers and frontline worker 


PART E 

35 

identified by the Union of India who were entitled to get 
vaccinated under Phase II." 
(emphasis supplied) 

35 
In response to the queries of the Court on how the supplies of vaccines will 

be allocated between various states if each State Government is to negotiate with 

vaccine producers, the Central Government has furnished the following 

justification in order to iron out the inequities between States: 

"For the remaining 50% non-government of India channel, 
the states and the private hospitals are free to procure 
vaccine for 18-44 years population, however, to have an 
equitable distribution of vaccine across the country, 
states have been allocated the available vaccine quantity 
in proportion to the population between 18-44 years of 
age of the respective state so as to ensure equitable 
distribution of vaccine as there is a possibility of some 
states having better bargaining power due to 
geographical advantage etc." 
(emphasis supplied) 

36 
During the course of the hearing, this Court has expressed its reservations 

prima facie on the validity of the revised policy under which the states and private 

hospitals are to procure 50% of the vaccines in order to immunize persons in the 

18-44 years age group. For one thing, even this age group would consist of 

persons who suffer from vulnerabilities. Once the vaccination programme has 

been opened up for persons other than the 45 plus age group, it would not be 

logical to impose the obligation to source vaccinations for the 18-44 age group on 

the State Governments. This will, inter alia, leave each State Government to 

negotiate supply schedules, delivery points and other logistical arrangements 

with the manufacturers. At present, there are only two manufacturers for the 

authorized vaccines (with one other vaccine -Sputnik V, in the process of 


PART E 

36 

manufacture). The available stock of vaccines is not adequate to deal with the 

requirements of both the categories. The Central Government must take the 

responsibility of providing guidance to every State on the quantities to be 

supplied to each State, the vaccine(s) being allocated, the period of delivery, and 

the number of persons who can be covered for vaccination, among other details. 

Leaving the State Governments to negotiate directly with manufacturers will 

produce chaos and uncertainty. The object of vaccinating the 18-44 age group 

cannot be achieved in the absence of stocks being available. 

37 
Besides the above issues, the Central Government is directed to clarify the 

following issues in order to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights to 

equality and to life and personal liberty for all persons who will be eligible to take 

the vaccine from 1 May 2021: 

(i) 
Whether the Central and State Governments have introduced any 

initiatives for ensuring the immunization of persons who do not have 

access to digital resources as otherwise the mandatory requirement of 

registration over the Co-WIN digital portal for persons in the age group of 

18-44 years will deprive a large class of citizens of vaccination; 

(ii) 
Since the Central Government commits to vaccinating persons over 45 

years, free of cost, in view of their vulnerability, whether walk-in facilities for 

vaccination will continue for these persons after 1 May 2021; 

(iii) Whether the Central or State Governments propose to undertake targeted 

vaccination drives for persons who are providing on-ground assistance 

during the second wave of the pandemic -such as crematorium workers, 


PART E 

37 

who were not considered as Frontline or Healthcare workers for Phase 1 of 

the vaccination drive; 

(iv) Whether, and if so what, steps being undertaken by INYAS, the nation-

wide mass awareness campaign for COVID-19 vaccination, for ensuring 

outreach in rural areas and socio-economically underprivileged sections of 

society including the possibility of using mobile vans, vehicles and railways 

to vaccinate such people as well as those living in remote areas, near their 

doorsteps so as to minimize their travel and potential infection with COVID-

2019. Efforts must also be made that a lack of an identity proof does not 

create a hindrance in the process of immunization of all individuals, 

specifically, the underprivileged; 

(v) 
Whether the Central government will revisit its policy by procuring 100% of 

the doses which can then be equitably disbursed to the State 

Governments; and 

(vi) Since the vaccine administration is now to be a shared responsibility of the 

Union and the States, the Central Government and the State Governments 

shall provide-(a) a breakup of the current and projected availability of 

vaccine stocks for the next 6 months; and (b) a timeline for achieving 

immunization of the newly eligible 59 crore persons who are aged between 

18-44 years. 

These issues are of vital importance, since vaccination appears to be one of the 

most important strategies to combat further spread of the pandemic, and would 

also provide a measure of security and assure the people about their health and 

well-being. 


PART E 

38 

E.2 Vaccine pricing 

38 
Since the advent of the revised rollout strategy with effect from 1 May 

2021, only persons aged 45 years and above are guaranteed a free vaccine. The 

reason of higher efficiency and speed has been furnished as a justification for 

enabling State Governments and private hospitals to directly procure vaccines. 

We have come to understand that a few State Governments have committed to 

free immunization under the revised strategy. On specific enquiry on the rationale 

in regard to the differential pricing for procurement by the Central Government 

and the State Governments, the Central Government has furnished the following 

justification: 

"It is submitted that liberty to decide prices on arm's 
length basis by and between the State Government and 
hospitals is based on the concept of creating an 
incentivized 
demand 
for 
the 
private 
vaccine 
manufacturers in order to instill a competitive market 
resulting in increased production of vaccines and market 
driven affordable prices for the same. Simultaneously, the 
free vaccination by the Central Government for above referred 
priority age groups would continue and it is always open for 
each State Government either to offer free vaccination or 
subsidise it for the additional identified earmarked priority 
group identified by the State Governments [age 18-44 years]. 

63. The new strategy was devised after multiple Inter-
Ministerial teams were deputed by Govt. of India to various 
manufacturing sites to understand their requirement and to 
provide pro-active and customized support to significantly 
augment vaccine production capacities [which is the prime 
priority of the Central Government at this juncture], in the form 
of advance payments, facilitating more sites for production 
etc. This approach, on the one hand, incentivizes vaccine 
manufacturers to rapidly scale up their production and on 
the other hand, it would also attract new vaccine 
manufacturers. It would make pricing, procurement and 
administration of vaccines more flexible and competitive 
and would further ensure augmented vaccine production 
as well as wider availability of vaccines in the country." 
(emphasis supplied) 


PART E 

39 

39 
Prima facie, there are several aspects of the vaccine pricing policy adopted 

by the Central government which require that policy be revisited. All vaccines, 

whether in the quantity of 50% purchased by the Central Government or the 

remaining 50%, are to be used for vaccinating citizens. The end use is the same. 

The Central Government proposes to purchase half of the total quantity falling 

within its fifty per cent quota while for the rest, the manufacturers would declare in 

advance the price to be fixed, allowing the State Governments to negotiate their 

terms. As of date, the manufacturers have suggested two different prices, a lower 

price which is applicable to the Central Government and a higher price which is 

applicable to the quantities purchased by the State Governments. It is likely that 

compelling the State Governments to negotiate with manufacturers on the ground 

of promoting competition and making it attractive for new vaccine manufactures 

will result in a serious detriment to those in the age group of 18 to 44 years, who 

will be vaccinated by the State Governments. The social strata of this age group 

also comprises persons who are Bahujans or belong to other under privileged 

and marginalized groups, like many in the other population age groups. They 

may not have the ability to pay. Whether or not essential vaccines will be made 

available to them will depend upon the decision of each State Government, 

based on its own finances, on whether or not the vaccine should be made 

available free or should be subsidized and if so, to what extent. This will create 

disparity across the nation. The vaccinations being provided to citizens constitute 

a valuable public good. Discrimination cannot be made between different classes 

of citizens who are similarly circumstanced on the ground that while the Central 

government will carry the burden of providing free vaccines for the 45 years and 


PART E 

40 

above population, the State Governments will discharge the responsibility of the 

18 to 44 age group on such commercial terms as they may negotiate. Prima 

facie, the rational method of proceeding in a manner consistent with the right to 

life (which includes the right to health) under Article 21 would be for the Central 

Government to procure all vaccines and to negotiate the price with vaccine 

manufacturers. Once quantities are allocated by it to each State Government, the 

latter would lift the allocated quantities and carry out the distribution. In other 

words, while procurement would be centralized, distribution of the vaccines 

across India within the States/UTs would be decentralized. While we are not 

passing a conclusive determination on the constitutionality of the current policy, 

the manner in which the current policy has been framed would prima facie result 

in a detriment to the right to public health which is an integral element of Article 

21 of the Constitution. Therefore, we believe that the Central Government should 

consider revisiting its current vaccine policy to ensure that it withstands the 

scrutiny of Articles 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution. 

40 
In light of the justification offered for non-interference in the prices that are 

set by the manufacturers, irrespective of their variance from the prices for 

procurement of the Central Government, we would like to seek the following 

clarifications: 

(i) 
Whether any other alternatives were considered by the Central 

Government for ramping up the immunization drive in India, particularly in 

light of its initial strategy of a centralized free immunization drive; 


PART E 

41 

(ii) 
The methodology which the Central Government was envisaging to 

procure adequate vaccine doses for the population prior to the revised 

strategy which was announced amidst the second wave of COVID-19; and 

(iii) Whether any studies and figures were relied upon in order to arrive at the 

conclusion that decentralized procurement would spur competitive markets 

to incentivize production and eventually drive down the prices of the 

vaccines. Whether these studies are of relevance in a pandemic when 

vaccines are a scarce and essential commodity which is being produced 

by a limited number of manufacturers for a limited number of vaccines. 

41 
The Central Government has submitted that the Finance Ministry has 

sanctioned a credit of Rs 3000 crores for Covishield manufacturer -Serum 

Institute of India 20 and Rs 1500 crores to Covaxin manufacturer -Bharat Biotech. 

Additionally, another Rs 65 crores is stated to have been provided to Bharat 

Biotech"s production center at Bangalore. In bolstering its argument for 

augmentation of vaccine production, the Central Government has provided the 

Court with further information on advance funding (of unspecified amounts) that is 

being provided to R&D and manufacturing facilities. In light of this investment, the 

Central Government should consider revisiting its policy bearing in mind what has 

been stated above, the following issues and other relevant information: 

20 "SII" 


PART F 

42 

(i) 
Whether, and if so, the Finance Ministry or any other funding organization 

of the Government of India have made any grants/sanctions to Bharat 

Biotech and the SII in the past, like the current infusion of Rs 1500 crores 

and Rs 3000 crores, respectively. If so, breakup and corelation with the 

total cost of development and production of the two vaccines; 

(ii) 
Whether the current procurement prices for the Central Government 

account for infusion of funds for production, infrastructure and other aid 

provided by it. If so, the basis on which the same benefit is denied to 

procurement by State Governments which equally service the needs of 

citizens; and 

(iii) 
The full extent of direct and indirect grant/aid provided for research, 

development and manufacture of all existing vaccines and future vaccines 

that it proposes to authorize. For instance, the Central Government has 

submitted in its affidavit that the Department of Biotechnology has 

facilitated the trials for Sputnik V. 

F 
Potentiality of Compulsory Licensing for vaccines and essential 

drugs 

42 
Several drugs that are at the core of the COVID treatment protocol are 

under patents in India including Remdesivir, Tociluzumab and Favipiravir. On 2 

October 2020, a communication was issued by the UOI, along with South Africa, 

to the Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property which stated that 

there were several reports about intellectual property rights hindering timely 


PART F 

43 

provisioning of affordable medical products to patients 21 . The communication also 

reported that some members of the World Trade Organization had carried out 

urgent amendments to their national patent laws to expedite the process of 

issuing compulsory/government use licenses. 

43 
In India, the patent regime is governed by the Patents Act, 1970 22 , Section 

92 of which envisages the grant of a compulsory license, inter alia, in 

circumstances of national emergency and extreme urgency. Once a declaration 

of national emergency is made, and the relevant patents notified, any person 

interested in manufacturing the drug can make an application to the Controller 

General of Patents who can then issue a compulsory license. The patentee 

would be paid a reasonable royalty as fixed by the Controller General of Patents. 

Further, under Section 100 of the Patents Act, the Central Government can 

authorize certain companies to use any patents for the "purpose of the 

government". Indian companies can begin manufacturing the drugs while 

negotiating the royalties with the patentees. If the Central Government or its 

authorized company is not able to reach an agreement with the patentee, the 

High Court has to fix the reasonable royalty that is to be paid to the patentee. 

Another alternative is for the Central Government to acquire the patents under 

Section 102 from the patentees. If the Central Government and the patentee is 

not able to reach a consensus on the price of the patents, it is up to the High 

Court to fix the royalty. Additionally, under Section 66 of the Patents Act, the 

Central Government is also entitled to revoke a patent in the public interest.

PART F 

44 

44 
The utilization of these flexibilities has also been detailed in the Trade 

Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement 23 . Even as TRIPS 

obliges countries to ensure a minimum level of patent protection, it creates a 

permissive regime for the carving out of exceptions and limitations that further 

public health objectives 24 . This is evident from a conjoint reading of Articles 7, 8, 

30 and 31 of TRIPS. Article 7 outlines the objectives of the TRIPS as being to 

ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property in a way that, inter alia, is 

"conducive to social and economic welfare". Article 8 gives member countries the 

freedom to take measures that protect public health and nutrition. Article 8(2) 

allows for the taking of TRIPS-compatible measures aimed at preventing the 

abuse of intellectual property rights. Articles 30 and 31 deal with exceptions to the 

rights of patent owners, by allowing grant of compulsory licenses. It leaves 

countries with significant breathing space to determine how the compulsory 

licensing or government-use levers can be triggered. While such determinations 

must be made on the individual merits of each case 25 , the aforesaid caveat does 

not apply when the compulsory license grant is for national emergency, extreme 

urgency or public non-commercial use 26 . 

45 
According to the 2001 Doha Declaration, TRIPS should be interpreted in a 

manner supportive of the right of members to protect public health and to promote 

access to medicines 27 . It recognizes the right of WTO members to use the full 

extent of the TRIPS flexibilities to secure this objective. Para 5(b) of the Doha

45 

Declaration provides the freedom to each member to grant compulsory licenses 

and to determine the grounds on which the licenses are granted. Para 5(c) leaves 

it up to each nation to determine what constitutes a national emergency or 

extreme urgency. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we note that several 

countries such as Canada and Germany have relaxed the legal regimes 

governing the grant of compulsory licenses 28 . 

46 
Whether and if so, the extent to which these provisions should be utilized is 

a policy decision for the Central Government. We have flagged the issue for its 

consideration. We have only outlined the legal framework within which the Central 

Government can possibly consider compulsory licensing and government 

acquisition of patents. The Central Government is free to choose any other 

course of action that it deems fit to tackle the issue of vaccine requirements in an 

equitable and expedient manner, which may involve negotiations with domestic 

and foreign producers of vaccines. We clarify that it is up to the Central 

28 "COVID-19 IP Policy Tracker" (WIPO, 16 July 2020), available at https://www.wipo.int/covid19-policy-

Supply of Essential Drugs 

G.1 Submissions in the Central Government's Affidavits 

47 
In relation to the broad issue of "Supply of Essentials", in its affidavit dated 

23 April 2021 and additional affidavit 29 April 2021, with respect to Remdesivir, 

the UOI urged that: 

(i) 
Remdesivir is a patented drug which is being manufactured in India under 

licensing agreements between the patent holder, M/s Gilead, a US based 

company and seven Indian companies. Under such agreements, these 

Indian companies are allowed to manufacture Remdesivir for distribution; 

(ii) 
In its affidavit dated 23 April 2021, it was submitted on behalf of the Central 

Government that the current production is about 74 lakhs vials per month 

and once the additional manufacturing sites of the seven manufacturers 

become operational by May 2021, the production capacity will increase to 

90 lakhs vials per month. In its additional affidavit dated 29 April 2021, the 

Central Government has submitted that as on 23 April 2021, the production 

capacity has increased to 1.03 crore vials per month; 

(iii) 
The Central Government allocated 11 lakhs vials of Remdesivir to nineteen 

States with a high case load between 21 to 30 April through a letter issued 

on 21 April 2021. This allocation was revised and expanded to all States 

and UTs through a letter issued on 24 April 2021; 


PART G 

47 

(iv) The Central Government has directed the States to appoint nodal officers 

to ensure unrestricted and timely movement of Remdesivir. A control room 

has been set up in this regard by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing 

Authority 29 which is monitoring supplies as allocated. A helpline has been 

set up by NPPA and manufacturers have been directed to address the 

hindrances in the movement of the drug. A WhatsApp group with nodal 

officers has also been created to enable coordination and officials of MHA, 

NPPA and CDSCO are also part of the group; 

(v) 
Remdesivir, its Active Pharma Ingredients 30 and formulations have been 

placed under export ban since 11 April 2021; 

(vi) The Ministry of Finance has issued a notification on 20 April 2021 

exempting customs duty on the Remdesivir injection, and API of 

Remdesivir and Betacyclodexterin, which are used in the manufacture of 

the injection. All the SEZ/EOU manufacturing units of M/s Mylan and M/s 

Honous Lab, who are manufacturing Remdesivir on behalf of some of the 

seven manufacturers have also been directed to start manufacturing 

Remdesivir for domestic supply; 

(vii) CDSCO has directed all State Drug Controllers on 10 April 2021 to conduct 

a special investigation drive to prevent hoarding and black-marketing of 

Remdesivir in the country. DCGI and State Drug Controllers have been 

taking stringent action against such activities and enforcement action has 

been taken in thirty-four cases across the country; 

29 "NPPA" 
30 "API" 


PART G 

48 

(viii) MHA has issued an advisory on 22 April 2021 to States and Union 

Territories to facilitate smooth movement of supplies. A "Covid Drug 

Management Cell" consisting of the Department"s Senior Officers and 

others has been constituted on 26 April 2021 to oversee and identify 

common concerns raised by States in relation to Remdesivir; 

(ix) NPPA has revised the maximum retail price of a 100 mg/vial of Remdesivir 

to Rs 3500; and 

(x) 
The Central Government is also looking at the possibility of importing 

Remdesivir. 

48 
The UOI made the following submissions on the availability of Tociluzumab 

injections: 

(i) 
Tociluzumab is manufactured by a Swiss Company, M/s Roche, which 

does not have any manufacturing facility in India or any agreements with 

domestic pharma companies to manufacture the drug. It is imported in the 

country by Cipla. India is completely dependent on imports; 

(ii) 
It is listed as an investigational therapy drug (off-label) under the National 

Clinical Management Protocol for COVID-19 for severe cases. There are 

domestically produced alternatives which are equivalent to or better than 

Tociluzumab such as itulizumab, dexamethasone and methyl 

prednisolone. However, an incorrect public perception has been created 

that only Tociluzumab can treat the inflammatory burst condition in COVID-

19 patients since it is an imported drug. This has led to the acute shortage 

in the availability of the drug and has created public panic; and 

(iii) 
The supply of Tociluzumab is being monitored by NPPA and CDSCO. 


PART G 

49 

49 
The UOI has made the following submissions on the availability of other 

drugs: 

(i) 
The National Clinical Management Protocol for COVID-19 does not include 

Favipirarvir (popularly known as Fabiflu) due to insufficient peer reviewed 

evidence to substantiate its use in mild to moderate cases of COVID-19. 

However, it is being prescribed by certain doctors. The clinical 

management protocol is a dynamic document which is reviewed 

periodically and is subject to further evaluation based on medical research 

and evidence that comes up in future; and 

(ii) 
On 24 April 2021, Department of Pharmaceuticals 31 , NPPA and DCGI had 

reviewed the production and supply of other drugs such as Favipiravir, 

Enoxaparin, Ivermectin, Methylprednisolone, Paracetamol and Hydroxy-

chloroquine. A meeting was conducted on 25 April 2021 by NPPA and 

DCGI with manufacturers to review stock position, availability and 

production plans. 

G.2 Recommendations 

50 
In respect of the essential drugs, this Court has been informed that the 

Central Government is taking steps to augment the production of Remdesivir. It 

has been brought to our notice that seven Indian companies are manufacturing 

this drug under a licensing agreement with a US based company, M/s Gilead. The 

current production capacity as on 23 April 2021 is noted to be at 1.03 crores vials 

per month. The Central Government should provide us with the details of the 

actual rate of production and a breakup of demand for the drug from different 

31 "DoP" 


PART G 

50 

States. Further, while it has been submitted on behalf of the Central Government 

that it is allocating the stocks based on a rational criterion of equitable distribution 

keeping in mind the existing constraints on the availability of the drug, this Court 

should be provided with details of the methodology used for such allocation. 

51 
We have been informed by the Central Government in its affidavit that 

NPPA has revised the maximum retail price of Remdesivir to Rs 3500. However, 

it has come to our notice that several other drugs which are being prescribed by 

doctors for treating COVID-19 patients like Favipiravir, Tociluzumab, Enoxaparin, 

Ivermectin, Methylprednisolone, Paracetamol and Hydroxy-chloroquine are being 

priced at exorbitant rates creating issues of access and affordability. While this is 

not a direction of this Court, the Central Government can consider invoking its 

statutory powers under paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Drugs Price Control Order, 

2013. Under paragraph 19 32 of the Drugs Price Control Order, 2013 the 

Government in extraordinary circumstances, if it considers necessary in public 

interest, can fix a ceiling price or retail price of the drug for a certain period. 

COVID-19 is a crisis of an unprecedented nature and qualifies as an 

extraordinary circumstance. It will be in public interest to ensure that the price of 

essential drugs is fixed in such a manner that it is available even to the most 

marginalized sections of the society. The Government can even monitor the 

prices of the drugs under paragraph 20 33 of the Drugs Price Control Order, 2013 

32 "19: Fixation of the Ceiling Price Under Certain Circumstances: Notwithstanding anything contained in this 
order, the Government may, in case of extraordinary circumstances, if it considers necessary to do so in public 
interest, fix the ceiling price or retail price of any drug, as it may deem fit and where the ceiling price or retail price 
of the drug is already fixed and notified, the Government may allow an increase or decrease in the ceiling price or 
the retail price, as the case may be, irrespective of annual wholesale price index of that year." 
33 "20: Monitoring the Prices of Non-Scheduled Formulations: (1) the Government shall monitor the maximum 
retail prices (MRP) of all the drugs, including the non-scheduled formulations and ensure that no manufacturer 
increases the maximum retail price of a drug more than ten percent of maximum retail price during preceding 
twelve months and where the increase is beyond ten percent of maximum retail price, it shall reduce the same to 


PART G 

51 

and ensure that no manufacturer increases the prices of the drugs by more than 

10% of the maximum retail price during the preceding 12 months and where the 

increase is beyond 10% of the maximum retail price, it can oblige the 

manufacturer to reduce it to the level of 10% for the next 12 months. 

52 
The Central Government has submitted that it plans to import Remdesivir. 

It can also consider importing other essential drugs to meet the immediate 

demand of the drug while the production is ramped up. We hasten to clarify that 

this does not constitute a direction of this Court and ultimately this decision falls 

under the domain of the executive. 

53 
We note that there are certain medicines which are being prescribed by 

doctors which are not mentioned in the National Clinical Management Protocol for 

COVID-19 like Favipiravir. However, since these medicines are being prescribed 

by doctors, people are facing significant inconvenience in obtaining them due to 

their shortage in certain parts of the country. The Central Government should 

consider whether the production of such medicines should be augmented to meet 

the demand or instructions should be given to the doctors to not recommend such 

medicines unless they have been included in the national protocol. 

54 
It has been submitted on behalf of the Central Government that on 24 April 

2021, DoP, NPPA and DGCI reviewed the production and supply of drugs such 

as Favipiravir, Enoxaparin, Ivermectin, Methylprednisolone, Paracetamol and 

Hydroxy-chloroquine. The supply of Remdesivir and Tociluzumab is already 

under the consideration of the Central Government. A meeting was also held on 

the level of ten percent of maximum retail price for next twelve months. (2) The manufacturer shall be liable to 
deposit the overcharged amount along with interest thereon from the date of the increase in price in addition to 
the penalty." 


PART G 

52 

25 April 2021 by DoP, NPPA and DGCI with the manufacturers to review stock 

position, availability and production plans. The Central Government should 

provide details of estimated demand of essential drugs mentioned above, 

production capacity, existing stocks, details of allocation and supply of such 

drugs. 

55 
As discussed in Section F, the Central Government can also consider 

using its powers under Sections 92, 100 or 102 of the Patents Act to increase 

production of essential drugs to ensure that it is commensurate to the demand. 

The Central Government"s affidavit testifies to existence of capacity of public 

sector organizations and institutes, which can assist in augmenting production of 

various drugs and formulations. The utilization of these capabilities to augment 

production, once licensing is resorted to, will be in the interests of the general 

public. This Court is further of the opinion that prima facie the present 

circumstance warrant the government"s examination of its the extraordinary 

powers, meant to be used in extreme situations, such as the current pandemic, 

for fixing drug prices, be it vaccines, or patented formulations, having regard to 

the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and other provisions 34 . We 

are cognizant that invocation of the above provisions, if any, is ultimately a policy 

decision of the Central Government and may encompass negotiations with the 

concerned stakeholders. We hope that the Central Government will adopt a route 

that best serves the public interest.

G.3 Black Marketing 

56 
This Court would like to take judicial notice of the fact that several critical 

drugs, used to treat COVID-19, such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, are being 

sold at significantly inflated prices or in fake form. This is a condemnable attempt 

to exploit people"s misery and profit from their helplessness. 

57 
In order to clamp down on this practice, the Central Government can 

consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute those who: (a) sell 

medical grade oxygen/COVID-19 medicines at exorbitant prices; and (b) sell fake 

substances and recover the concerned substances. A protocol for ambulances 

must also be evolved to avoid citizens being exploited by extracting 

unconscionable charges. The Central Government can consider creating a 

platform for easy reporting and redressal of such cases. 

H 
Recommendations for augmenting healthcare workforce 

58 
It is common knowledge that a large number of medical, nursing and 

pharmacy students, who graduated in 2020 and would be in the process of 

graduating in 2021, would be available to augment the workforce in the health 

sector. The Central Government should, we feel, look into this aspect, and ensure 

the optimal manner of utilization of their services, regard being had, of course, to 

their safety and well-being. 

59 
The Central Government should also consider using health care workforce 

available with the armed forces and para military forces for the purpose of 

vaccination.

Epilogue 

60 
The World Health Organisation 35 , while discussing the rapid spread of 

COVID-19 has not only labelled it an epidemic but also an "infodemic", due to the 

overabundance of information on the internet, which was riddled with 

misinformation and disinformation 36 . This highlights the key role internet and 

technology currently has in all our lives, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. 

Indeed, the WHO recently also conducted a study to understand how individuals 

between the ages of 18-40 years dealt with the ongoing pandemic using social 

media 37 . 

61 
It is only appropriate then that when many cities in India are suffering 

through the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have turned to the 

internet, using applications/websites to find critical support. On these platforms, 

online communities led by members of the civil society and other individuals, have 

assisted the needy in multiple ways -often by helping them procure oxygen, 

essential drugs or find a hospital bed through their own networks or by amplifying 

original requests, and even by offering moral and emotional support. However, it 

is with deep distress that we note that individuals seeking help on such platforms 

have been targeted, by alleging that the information posted by them is false and 

has only been posted in social media to create panic, defame the administration 

or damage the "national image". We do not hesitate in saying that such targeting

shall not be condoned, and the Central Government and State Governments 

should ensure that they immediately cease any direct or indirect threats of 

prosecution and arrest to citizens who air grievances or those that are attempting 

to help fellow citizens receive medical aid. If this does keep happening even after 

the current order, this Court shall be constrained to use the powers available to it 

under it contempt jurisdiction. We also direct that all Directors General of Police 

shall ensure compliance down the ranks of the police forces within their 

jurisdictions. 

62 
In these trying times, those desperately seeking help for their loved ones 

on these platforms should not have their misery compounded through the actions 

of the State and its instrumentalities. Further, there are two more crucial reasons 

why such a clampdown on information sharing must be absolutely stopped 

immediately. 

63 
The first reason is because sharing information widely is in itself an 

important tool in combating public tragedies, like the current COVID-19 pandemic. 

In K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy-9J.) vs Union of India 38 , one of us (DY 

Chandrachud, J) speaking for four Judges of a nine-Judge bench of this Court 

noted academic literature documenting the widespread availability of information 

and the resultant acknowledgement of the problem is what prevented the drought 

in Maharashtra in 1973 from becoming as bad as the Bengal Famine of 1943, 

where the British tried to deny the problem even existed. It was noted thus: 

"267. Civil and political rights and socio-economic rights do 
not exist in a state of antagonism. The conditions necessary 
for realising or fulfilling socio-economic rights do not postulate 

38 (2017) 10 SCC 1 


PART I 

56 

the subversion of political freedom. The reason for this is 
simple. Socio-economic entitlements must yield true benefits 
to those for whom they are intended. This can be achieved by 
eliminating rent-seeking behaviour and by preventing the 
capture of social welfare benefits by persons who are not 
entitled to them. Capture of social welfare benefits can be 
obviated only when political systems are transparent and 
when there is a free flow of information. Opacity enures to the 
benefit of those who monopolise scarce economic resources. 
On the other hand, conditions where civil and political 
freedoms flourish ensure that governmental policies are 
subjected to critique and assessment. It is this scrutiny 
which subserves the purpose of ensuring that socio-
economic 
benefits 
actually 
permeate 
to 
the 
underprivileged for whom they are meant. Conditions of 
freedom and a vibrant assertion of civil and political 
rights promote a constant review of the justness of 
socio-economic programmes and of their effectiveness 
in addressing deprivation and want. Scrutiny of public 
affairs is founded upon the existence of freedom. Hence 
civil and political rights and socio-economic rights are 
complementary and not mutually exclusive. 

268. Some of these themes have been addressed in the 
writings of the Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen. Sen compares 
the response of many non-democratic regimes in critical 
situations such as famine with the responses of democratic 
societies in similar situations. [ Amartya Sen, Development as 
Freedom (Oxford University Press, 2000) at pp. 178-79.]… 

269. In the Indian context, Sen points out that the Bengal 
famine of 1943 "was made viable not only by the lack of 
democracy in colonial India but also by severe restrictions on 
reporting and criticism imposed on the Indian press, and the 
voluntary practice of "silence" on the famine that the British-
owned media chose to follow" [ Amartya Sen, The Idea of 
Justice (Penguin Books, 2009) at p. 339.] . Political liberties 
and democratic rights are hence regarded as "constituent 
components" of development. [Id, at p. 347] In contrast during 
the drought which took place in Maharashtra in 1973, food 
production failed drastically and the per capita food output 
was half of that in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there was no 
famine in Maharashtra where five million people were 
employed in rapidly organised public projects while there 
were substantial famines in sub-Saharan Africa. This 
establishes what he terms as "the protective role of 
democracy". Sen has analysed the issue succinctly: 

"The causal connection between democracy and the non-
occurrence of famines is not hard to seek. Famines kill 
millions of people in different countries in the world, but they 


PART I 

57 

don't kill the rulers. The kings and the presidents, the 
bureaucrats and the bosses, the military leaders and the 
commanders never are famine victims. And if there are no 
elections, no opposition parties, no scope for uncensored 
public criticism, then those in authority don't have to suffer the 
political consequences of their failure to prevent famines. 
Democracy, on the other hand, would spread the penalty of 
famines to the ruling groups and political leaders as well. This 
gives them the political incentive to try to prevent any 
threatening famine, and since famines are in fact easy to 
prevent (the economic argument clicks into the political one at 
this stage), the approaching famines are firmly prevented." [ 
Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom (Oxford University 
Press, 2000) at p. 180.]..."" 

(emphasis supplied) 

As such, preventing clampdowns on sharing of information on online platforms is 

not just in the interest of individuals sharing the information, but the larger 

democratic structures of our nation. Without the ready availability of such 

information, it is entirely possible that the COVID-19 pandemic may turn into a 

tragedy worse than what it already is. 

64 
The second reason is because sharing information widely will help in the 

creation of a "collective public memory" of this pandemic. The presence of 

collective public memory, which refers "to an extant and taken-for-granted group 

memory" 39 , is important for the creation of knowledge of the problems plaguing us 

today, so they may be passed on across time 40 . This is important since we do not 

have to travel back too much in our past to realise that the pandemic caused by 

the "Spanish" flu of 1918, which is said to have infected every third person in the

who died in World War I), has been almost entirely erased from our collective 

public memory 41 . Therefore, the widespread sharing of information by individuals 

living through the COVID-19 pandemic becomes crucial. Furthermore, the role of 

Courts in creating and preserving this collective public memory cannot be 

understated. Professors Austin Sarat and Thomas R. Kearns, in their book 

History, Memory, and the Law, describe the function that is played by Courts in 

the following terms 42 : 

"Law in the modern era is, we believe, one of the most 
important of our society's technologies for preserving 
memory. Just as the use of precedent to legitimate legal 
decisions fixes law in a particular relation to the past, memory 
may be attached, or attach itself, to law and be preserved in 
and through law. Where this is the case, it serves as one way 
of orienting ourselves to the future. As Drucilla Cornell puts 
it: "Legal interpretation demands that we remember the 
future." In that phrase, Cornell reminds us that there are, 
in fact, two audiences for every legal act, the audience of 
the present and the audience of the future. Law 
materializes memory in documents, transcripts, written 
opinions; it re-enacts the past, both intentionally and 
unconsciously, and it is one place where the present 
speaks to the future through acts of commemoration. 

Because the litigated case creates a record, courts can 
become archives in which that record serves as the 
materialization of memory. Due process guarantees an 
opportunity to be heard by, and an opportunity to speak 
to, the future. It is the guarantee that legal institutions 
can be turned into museums of unnecessary, unjust, 
undeserved pain and death. The legal hearing provides 
lawyers and litigants an opportunity to write and record 
history by creating narratives of present injustices, and 
to insist on memory in the face of denial. By recording 
such history and constructing such narratives lawyers and 
litigants call on an imagined future to choose Justice over the 
"jurispathic" tendencies of the moment."

Hence, in the present proceedings, we hope to not only initiate a dialogue so as 

to better tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic but also to preserve its memory 

in our public records, so that future generations may evaluate our efforts and 

learn from them. 

65 
We speak not only as members of this Court, but also as grateful citizens 

of the country, and commend the outstanding work of our all healthcare 

professionals (doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, laboratory technicians, ward 

staff, ambulance drivers, crematorium workers etc.) during this crisis. They have 

truly gone beyond their call of duty and toiled day in and day out, relentlessly 

without rest amidst great challenges. It is absolutely necessary to take urgent 

steps for their well-being to ensure that our appreciation for their tremendous 

efforts is not reduced to rhetoric. This is especially important since another factor 

which affects how collective public memory of any event is created is by the 

rhetoric surrounding it 43 . As such, our public memory of this public event has to 

transcend its conception as a "war" against the virus of COVID-19 itself, but rather 

to remember that it is "the complex epidemiological circumstances that promote 

these outbreaks and the under-resourced health systems that are tasked with 

disease containment" 44 . While the healthcare professionals have been at the 

forefront of tackling this crisis, we have to recognize their contribution as medical 

healthcare professionals who have undertaken "to protect public health using

proven scientific evidence and best practices and to serve to community at 

large" 45 , and not just as "CORONA WARRIORS". 

66 
We also do not hesitate to note that the treatment meted out to these public 

healthcare professional during this COVID-19 pandemic has sometimes been 

less than ideal. The following are some of the issues we wish to highlight: 

(i) 
Recently, there were reports that the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan 

Package Insurance Scheme, an insurance scheme of Rs 50 lakhs which 

had been extended to about 22 lakh healthcare professionals, was set to 

expire on 24 March 2021 and would not be renewed. While we are happy 

to note that UOI"s affidavit of 23 April 2021 states that this Scheme has 

been extended for one year starting April 2021, we have also been 

informed that till date only 287 claims have been settled under it, which 

includes claims from the families of 168 doctors who died after contracting 

COVID-19 while treating patients. We direct the Central Government to 

inform this Court as to how many claims are pending under the Scheme, 

and the timeline within which the Central Government expects to settle 

them; 

(ii) 
Healthcare personnel are at an obvious heightened risk of contracting the 

COVID-19 virus. However, we are aware of reports that indicate that 

infected healthcare personnel are left to fend for themselves without 

adequate availability of beds, oxygen or essential drugs. Further, some of 

them have also often been asked to report back to duty within 10 days of 

first testing positive for COVID-19 (provided they are asymptomatic), even

though a longer recuperation period is often recommended. While we are 

dealing with a terrible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there must 

be an effective policy to ensure that the nation truly acknowledges their 

effort and creates incentives for them. We hope it will be remedied soon by 

the Central and State Governments through the introduction of appropriate 

guidelines and measures; 

(iii) 
It is unclear what measures are currently being taken to ensure that 

healthcare personnel can continue to serve others while not risking the 

health of their family members. We hope that the respective State 

Governments, with necessary assistance from the Central Government, 

can ensure this takes place; and 

(iv) The Central Government should, we feel examine and ensure that in 

addition to the schemes it has framed, other facilities such as availability of 

food, resting facilities during intervals between work, transportation 

facilities, non-deduction of salary or leave account, if afflicted by COVID 

2019 or related infection, overtime allowance, in both public and private 

hospitals, and a separate helpline for doctors, and healthcare 

professionals, in cases of COVID 2019 related emergencies, is provided. 

All these, we feel, would show these professionals that we do not show our 

appreciation in mere words, but also care for them. 

67 
The issues mentioned above are only symptomatic of the other broader 

issues that are being faced by healthcare professionals, who are instrumental in 

combating the pandemic. Hence, we hope their welfare is considered seriously by 

the Central and State Governments. Further, we would wish to use this order to 


PART J 

62 

place on record our sincerest appreciation for all the public healthcare 

professionals -not just limited to the doctors, but also nurses, hospital staff, 

ambulance drivers, sanitation workers and crematorium workers. It is through 

their dedicated efforts that the effect of COVID-19 pandemic is being currently 

tackled in India. 

68 
In light of the continuing surge of infections in the second wave of the 

pandemic, we direct the Central Government and State Governments to put on 

record the efforts taken to curb the spread of the virus and the measures that they 

plan on taking in the near future. At the same time, we would seriously urge the 

Central and State Governments to consider imposing a ban on mass gatherings 

and super spreader events. They may also consider imposing a lockdown to curb 

the virus in the second wave in the interest of public welfare. Having said that, we 

are cognizant of the socio-economic impact of a lockdown, specifically, on the 

marginalized communities. Thus, in case the measure of a lockdown is imposed, 

arrangements must be made beforehand to cater to the needs of these 

communities.
