			<p>A.<lb/> A secret information was received by the NCB on 26.05.2014 to<lb/> the effect that a parcel lying at DHL Express Pvt. India Ltd. 40 Okhla<lb/> Estate, New Delhi, was suspected to contain narcotic substances. The<lb/> information revealed that the parcel had been booked from ANS<lb/> Express Services Pvt. Ltd. 413 Sant Nagar, East of Kailash, New<lb/> Delhi under AWB No. 5546780993, with Liberia (Africa) as the<lb/> destination.<lb/></p>

			<p>B.<lb/> An NCB team reached the DHL office at 2:30 PM on<lb/> 26.05.2014. In the presence of two independent witnesses, the parcel<lb/> bearing AWB No. 5546780993 was opened, and contained ladies&apos;<lb/> clothes and accessories, including a packet of 12 &quot;thread piece rolls&quot;.<lb/> One of the thread piece rolls was found to have a cavity, which<lb/> contained an off white coloured powder in a roll. A small quantity of<lb/> the powder was tested with the help of field-testing kit, and gave<lb/> positive result for heroin. The remaining 11 thread piece rolls were<lb/> thereafter opened, and contained similar cavities with off white<lb/> coloured powder. The off white coloured powder from each of the 11<lb/> thread piece rolls was tested with the field-testing kit, and it also gave<lb/> positive result for heroin.<lb/></p>

			<p>C.<lb/> The powder from the 12 cavities, having the same colour,<lb/> texture and properties, was thereafter mixed, and was transferred into<lb/> a transparent plastic packet which was weighed on an electronic<lb/> weighing machine, and came to weigh 200 grams.<lb/></p>

			<p>D.<lb/> Two samples of 5 grams each were drawn, and put in separate<lb/> zip-lock pouches, which in turn, were put in separate white paper<lb/> envelopes. The packets were sealed with the NCB seal, and signed by<lb/> the Investigating Officer [hereinafter, &quot;IO&quot;], and the independent<lb/> witnesses. The remaining 190 grams of heroin was kept in a separate<lb/> transparent package in a white cloth, and similarly sealed and signed.<lb/> The remaining stitching material was separately wrapped. The parcel<lb/> contained the name of the consignor as Mr. Ashish Kanojia, 78, Block-<lb/>C Duggal Colony, Khanpur, Delhi, 110062, and the consignee as Lisa<lb/> Phombeh, Perry Town V, OA.A, Monrovia, Liberia, Post 1000,<lb/> Liberia.<lb/> E.<lb/> Notices under Section 67 of the Act were issued to both the<lb/> independent witnesses and their statements were taken on 09.06.2014.<lb/> Two other witnesses, Mr. Shamsher Singh of ANS Express Services<lb/> Pvt. Ltd. and Mr. Arjun Pal Singh of Balaji Courier &amp; Cargo, B-7<lb/> Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, were also issued notices under Section 67 of<lb/> the Act, and they made their statements on 04.07.2014 and 14.08.2014<lb/> respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>F.<lb/> Mr. Ashish Kanojia, the consignor of the parcel, was also issued<lb/> a notice under Section 67 of the Act, and made a voluntary statement<lb/> on 01.06.2014 1 .<lb/></p>

			<p>G.<lb/> On the basis of his statement, an information was then prepared<lb/> by the IO that the parcel belonged to one Mr. Jonas Orji, who is a<lb/> Nigerian national, and is a resident at House No. 363, Dhaka Johar,<lb/> near Parmanand Colony, New Delhi [hereinafter, &quot;the property&quot;]. It<lb/> was stated that Mr. Jonas Orji had called Mr. Ashish Kanojia again on<lb/> 02.06.2014 for delivery of another parcel at his residence. An<lb/> apprehension was recorded that Mr. Jonas Orji might be involved in<lb/> drug trafficking, and if apprehended, huge quantity of narcotics may<lb/> be recovered from him.<lb/></p>

			<p>H.<lb/> A team was thereafter constituted, which was sent to the<lb/> residence of Mr. Jonas Orji on 02.06.2014 at 11:40 AM. The owner of<lb/> the property, Mr. Sunil Gulati, agreed to act as an independent<lb/> witness. The house was approached in his presence. A man, who<lb/> identified himself as Mr. Ejike Jonas Orji [the applicant herein], and a<lb/> lady, who identified herself as Ms. Ratharmi Sero [hereinafter, &quot;Ms.<lb/> Sero&quot;], were present in the house at the time of the search. Both of<lb/> them were served with notices under Section 50 of the Act, but<lb/> declined to be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate. On<lb/> their personal search, nothing incriminating was recovered from the<lb/> two individuals.<lb/></p>

			<p>I.<lb/> On searching the house, an &quot;Orange coloured lehenga&quot; was<lb/> found on a table in the first room of the house. Some substance was<lb/> found to be concealed/stitched inside the layers of the gotta of the<lb/> lehenga. It was cut open, and found to contain a tube-shaped<lb/> transparent polythene, which contained off white coloured powder.<lb/> The powder was tested with DD kit, and gave positive result for<lb/> heroin. Upon cutting all the layers of gotta, 70 such tubes were found,<lb/> each of which contained similar off white coloured powder.<lb/></p>

			<p>J.<lb/> A small quantity of the powder was taken from each of the<lb/> tubes, and was subsequently tested with the DD kit. Each of the<lb/> samples gave positive results for heroin.<lb/></p>

			<p>K.<lb/> The powder from all the tubes, having the same colour, texture<lb/> and properties, was thereafter mixed, and transferred into a transparent<lb/> packet, which was found to weigh 265 grams.<lb/></p>

			<p>L.<lb/> Two samples of 5 grams each were drawn, and put in polythene<lb/> pouches, which in turn were kept in white envelopes. They were<lb/> signed by the applicant herein, the IO, and the independent witness<lb/> and was subsequently sealed with the seal of NCB. The remaining<lb/> quantity of the powder was kept in a transparent packet, and stitched<lb/> in a white cloth, and similarly signed and sealed.<lb/></p>

			<p>M. During the search of a bedroom, small crushed pieces of a &quot;dark<lb/> green coloured substance&quot; was found wrapped in plastic tape, hidden<lb/> in a wooden almirah. Testing of a small quantity of the same with the<lb/> help of the DD kit gave positive result for charas. The substance was<lb/> transferred to a transparent polythene bag, and when weighed, was<lb/> found to be 170 grams.<lb/></p>

			<p>N.<lb/> Two samples of 25 grams each were drawn, kept in separate<lb/> zip-lock pouches, which in turn were kept in white paper envelopes,<lb/> and similarly signed and sealed. The remaining 120 grams of the<lb/> substance was kept in a transparent packet, stitched in a white marking<lb/> cloth, signed and sealed. Panchnama and test memos were prepared,<lb/> which were signed by the applicant and the IO, as well as by the<lb/> independent witness.<lb/></p>

			<p>O.<lb/> The applicant and Ms. Sero were thereafter issued notices under<lb/> Section 67 of the Act, and were asked to appear forthwith before the<lb/> NCB. Ms. Sero made a statement on the same date that she was not<lb/> aware of the alleged business of drug trafficking of the applicant, who<lb/> is her husband. As a result, she was not arrested. The applicant made<lb/> his statement before the NCB on 03.06.2014.<lb/> P.<lb/> Consequent upon the recovery of 200 grams of heroin from the<lb/> parcel, 265 grams of heroin and 170 grams of charas from the<lb/> applicant&apos;s house, and on the basis of his statement under Section 67<lb/> of the Act, the applicant was arrested on 03.06.2014.<lb/></p>

			<p>Q.<lb/> Mr. Sunil Gulati [owner of the property and the independent<lb/> witness] appeared before the NCB on 09.06.2014, and made his<lb/> statement under Section 67 of the Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>R.<lb/> Enquires were made regarding the applicant&apos;s mobile number<lb/> 8447262566, which was found to be issued in the name of one Mr.<lb/> Pradeep Kumar. Notice under Section 67 of the Act was issued to Mr.<lb/> Pradeep Kumar on 07.07.2014. Mr. Pradeep Kumar stated that he had<lb/> no connection with the said mobile number and does not know the<lb/> applicant.<lb/></p>

			<p>S.<lb/> Samples of the substances recovered from the parcel, as well as<lb/> the residence of the applicant, were sent for chemical examination to<lb/> the Central Revenues Control Laboratory, New Delhi [hereinafter,<lb/> &quot;CRCL&quot;]. On examination of the alleged contraband by the CRCL,<lb/> the substance recovered from the parcel was found positive for heroin,<lb/> as was one of the samples from the residence of the applicant. The<lb/> other sample which was recovered from the house of the applicant was<lb/> found positive for charas.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> As evident from the above, the applicant has been accused of<lb/> conscious possession of at least 265 grams of heroin (which<lb/> constitutes a commercial quantity), and 175 grams of charas (which<lb/> constitutes an intermediate quantity). Although the prosecution also<lb/> attributes to him the 200 grams of heroin recovered from the parcel<lb/> (which constitutes an intermediate quantity), the accused disputes the<lb/> said possession. In view of the fact that, at the minimum, the case<lb/> against the applicant involves conscious possession of 265 grams of<lb/> heroin, which is a commercial quantity of narcotics under the Act,<lb/> there is no dispute that the rigors of Section 37 of the Act are attracted<lb/> to the present case.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> The applicant has been in custody in connection with the case<lb/> since 03.06.2014, and remains in custody for a period of eight years.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> The applicant first approached the Special Court for bail, which<lb/> was rejected on 11.11.2020. The applicant then filed BAIL APPL.<lb/></p>

			<p>369/2021 before this Court, which was dismissed as withdrawn on<lb/> 22.03.2021, with a direction that the Special Court shall endeavor to<lb/> dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> While issuing notice in the present application, the Nominal<lb/> Roll of the applicant was also called for from the jail authorities,<lb/> which reveals that, as on 12.05.2022, he had been in custody for a<lb/> period of 7 years 11 months and 9 days. Although his overall conduct<lb/> is characterized as unsatisfactory due to punishments awarded to him<lb/> on 09.02.2017 and 10.01.2019, his jail conduct during the last one<lb/> year has been certified to be satisfactory.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> No prior involvement of the applicant in any offence has been<lb/> mentioned in the reply filed by the NCB to the present application.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> It may be noted that Mr. Ashish Kanojia was not named as an<lb/> accused in the chargesheet, but was subsequently arraigned as an<lb/> accused pursuant to the orders of the Special Court. He was enlarged<lb/> on bail within one year and, according to the Nominal Roll of the<lb/> applicant, Mr. Ashish Kanojia was released on 18.11.2015.<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> As far as the trial is concerned, it appears that out of the 25<lb/> prosecution witnesses [hereinafter, &quot;PW&quot;] cited in the chargesheet,<lb/> Mr. Ashish Kanojia has been made an accused, 4 PWs have been<lb/> dropped, and 14 out of the remaining 20 PWs have been examined.<lb/></p>

			<head>Submissions<lb/></head>

			<p>10. Mr. Adarsh Priyadarshi, learned counsel for the applicant, has<lb/> made the following submissions in support of the present application:-<lb/></p>

			<p>A.<lb/> Mr. Priyadarshi submitted that the applicant is entitled to be<lb/> enlarged on bail on the ground of prolonged incarceration as an<lb/> undertrial. In support of this argument, he relied upon the judgment of<lb/> the Supreme Court in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee<lb/> (Representing Undertrial Prisoners) vs. Union of India and Others 2<lb/> [hereinafter, &quot;SCLAC&quot;], wherein the Supreme Court laid down<lb/> guidelines for release of undertrial prisoners on bail, where the<lb/> accused were facing trial for offences under the Act. Mr. Priyadarshi<lb/> submitted that the said judgment has been noticed by the Supreme<lb/> Court more recently in Thana Singh vs. Central Bureau of Narcotics 3 .<lb/> He also relied upon the interpretation of SCLAC judgment by a<lb/> Division Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in In Re-Sanawar Ali 4<lb/> and by coordinate benches of this Court in Atul Aggarwal vs.<lb/> Directorate of Revenue Intelligence 5 and in Anil Kumar alias Nillu vs.<lb/> State 6 . Relying upon the aforesaid judgments, Mr. Priyadarshi<lb/> submitted that the applicant, who has been in custody for eight years,<lb/> is entitled to be enlarged on bail on the strength of the SCLAC<lb/> judgment.<lb/></p>

			<p>B.<lb/> Mr. Priyadarshi relied upon an order of the Supreme Court in<lb/> Baba Fakruddin Sheikh @ Fakru vs. The State (NCT of Delhi) 7 ,<lb/> wherein the applicant therein was denied bail by an order of this Court<lb/> dated 25.03.2021 in Bail Application No. 334/2021, on the finding<lb/> that a commercial quantity of contraband had been recovered, and<lb/> Section 37 of the Act would be attracted. The Supreme Court,<lb/> however, directed the accused to be enlarged on bail, noting in its<lb/> order that the petitioner had suffered incarceration for a period of<lb/> seven years and six months, and that there was no possibility of the<lb/> trial being concluded in the near future.<lb/></p>

			<p>C.<lb/> Mr. Priyadarshi submitted on merits that, even taking into<lb/> account the provisions of Section 37 of the Act, the applicant is<lb/> entitled to be released on bail. He emphasized that, in view of the<lb/> judgment of the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh vs. State of Tamil<lb/> Nadu 8 , the statements of Mr. Ashish Kanojia and the applicant<lb/> himself, recorded under Section 67 of the Act, cannot be read as<lb/> evidence against the applicant.<lb/></p>

			<item>D.<lb/> In the absence of any other evidence, Mr. Priyadarshi argued<lb/> that the sampling procedure adopted by the NCB, both with regard to<lb/> the recovery from the parcel at the courier office, and at the residence<lb/> of the applicant, was inconsistent with the prescribed procedures, as<lb/> the substances alleged to have been recovered from different<lb/> packets/tubes were mixed together before drawing samples for<lb/> chemical testing. He argued that the representative character of the<lb/> samples was thus vitiated. In support of this contention, he relied upon<lb/> the judgments of the coordinate benches of this Court in Amani Fidel<lb/> Chris vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 9 , Charlse Howell @ Abel Kom vs.<lb/> NCB 10 , and Mokibe MR Leepile Moses @ Patrick Umechukwu vs.<lb/> Narcotics Control Bureau 11 .<lb/></item>

			<p>11. Mr. Shashwat Bansal, learned counsel for the NCB, on the other<lb/> hand, contested the application principally on the following grounds:<lb/></p>

			<p>A.<lb/> Mr. Bansal submitted that the SCLAC judgment was expressly<lb/> stated to be a one-time measure, and applicable only to the State of<lb/> Maharashtra. Although the SCLAC judgment was thereafter extended<lb/> to some other states by an order of the Supreme Court in Supreme<lb/> Court Legal Aid Committee (Representing Undertrial Prisoners) vs.<lb/> Union of India and Others 12 , learned counsel emphasized that it was<lb/> not extended to Delhi.<lb/></p>

			<p>B.<lb/> In any event, Mr. Bansal submitted that paragraph 16 of the<lb/> SCLAC judgment makes it clear that the directions given therein were<lb/> not intended to restrict the powers of the Special Courts under Section<lb/> 37 of the Act. Having regard to the fact that the applicant is not a<lb/> citizen of India, Mr. Bansal submitted that the normal considerations<lb/> applicable to proceedings for bail, including the likelihood that the<lb/> accused would flee from justice or would tamper with the evidence,<lb/> militate against the grant of bail to the applicant in the present case.<lb/></p>

			<p>C.<lb/> Mr. Bansal relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in<lb/> Achint Navinbhai Patel alias Mahesh Shah vs. State of Gujarat and<lb/> Anr. 13 , to submit that prolonged incarceration is not always a sufficient<lb/> ground for grant of bail in an offence alleged to have been committed<lb/> under the Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>D.<lb/> Mr. Bansal cited the judgment of a coordinate bench of this<lb/> Court in Bobby Collin vs. Narcotic Control Bureau 14 to submit that, in<lb/> a similar case under the Act, this Court had declined to release the<lb/> applicant on bail, despite incarceration for a period of over six years.<lb/> He pointed out that the Court considered the judgment in Amani Fidel<lb/> Chris 15 , but declined to consider this argument at the stage of bail,<lb/> particularly because only one prosecution witness remained to be<lb/> examined. A similar contention was also considered in Anthony Umeh<lb/> vs. State 16 , Naveed Ummer Sheikh vs. Narcotic Control Bureau<lb/> Through: Shri Mukesh Malik Prosecutor NCB 17 and Bipin Bihari<lb/> Lenka vs. Narcotic Control Bureau 18 .<lb/></p>

			<p>E.<lb/> Mr. Bansal relied upon the judgments of this Court in Mohd<lb/> Hanif vs. NCB 19 , Emeka Charles Omuka vs. Narcotic Control<lb/> Bureau 20 and Edwin Emeka Igbowke vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 21<lb/> to submit that this Court has refused to grant bail to accused alleged to<lb/> have committed offences under the Act wherein the contraband seized<lb/> was in commercial quantity, and that the rigors of Section 37 of the<lb/> Act will be attracted.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. In rejoinder, Mr. Priyadarshi submitted that the applicant&apos;s<lb/> citizenship status ought not to detain this Court as the Act makes no<lb/> distinction between accused on the basis of their citizenship. He<lb/> contended that the SCLAC judgment specifically deals with foreigners<lb/> accused under the Act and lays down special safeguards which may be<lb/> imposed while granting bail to foreign nationals. In the present case,<lb/> he submitted that the chargesheet itself reveals that the applicant is<lb/> married to an Indian citizen, and is ordinarily resident within the<lb/> jurisdiction of this Court. He stated that the applicant and his wife also<lb/> have a young child. Mr. Priyadarshi handed up several orders to the<lb/> Court in which bail was granted to foreigners, including those accused<lb/> of having committed offences under the Act.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>13. At the outset, as noted above, even assuming in favour of the<lb/> applicant that the recovery from the courier parcel cannot be attributed<lb/> to him, the present case concerns recovery of commercial quantity of<lb/> heroin (in addition to an intermediate quantity of charas), and Section<lb/> 37 of the Act would thus be applicable. Section 37 of the Act lays<lb/> down the twin tests, which must be satisfied before granting bail in<lb/> such a case, in addition to the normal conditions for grant of bail under<lb/> the CrPC. It provides as follows:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;37. Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable:-<lb/></item>

			<item>(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)<lb/></item>

			<item>(a) every offence punishable under this Act shall be<lb/> cognizable;<lb/></item>

			<item>(b) no person accused of an offence punishable for<lb/> 2[offences under section 19 or section 24 or section 27A<lb/> and also for offences involving commercial quantity]<lb/> shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless-<lb/></item>

			<item>(i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an<lb/> opportunity to oppose the application for such<lb/> release, and<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the<lb/> application, the court is satisfied that there are<lb/> reasonable grounds for believing that he is not<lb/> guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to<lb/> commit any offence while on bail.<lb/></item>

			<item>(2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause<lb/> (b) of sub-section (1) are in addition to the limitations<lb/> under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)<lb/> or any other law for the time being in force, on granting<lb/> of bail.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>14. Turning to the question of whether or not the applicant is<lb/> entitled to be released on bail on the ground of prolonged<lb/> incarceration as an undertrial prisoner, the SCLAC judgment is of<lb/> foremost significance in this regard. The petition before the Supreme<lb/> Court was motivated by the delay in disposal of cases under the Act,<lb/> particularly involving foreigners. During the proceedings, the scope<lb/> was expanded to cover all undertrial prisoners who were in jail for<lb/> offences under the Act for a period of over two years. The Court noted<lb/> that, despite the provision for trial before Special Courts under the<lb/> Act, the disposal of cases has taken much longer than originally<lb/> envisioned. The Supreme Court found that the delay in trial, when<lb/> read with the stringent provisions of Section 37 of the Act, render the<lb/> fundamental rights of the accused under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the<lb/> Constitution in jeopardy. Although the Court declined to quash the<lb/> charges against the accused on this basis, it accepted the alternative<lb/> submission that the accused should be released on bail after a certain<lb/> period of incarceration, if the trial has been delayed beyond a<lb/> reasonable time. The Court categorized the cases according to the<lb/> punishment prescribed for the offence in question. In the case of<lb/> persons accused of offences punishable with minimum imprisonment<lb/> of ten years and a minimum fine of ₹1 lakh, the Court directed that<lb/> they be released on bail if they had been in jail for not less than five<lb/> years, subject to furnishing bail in the sum of ₹1 lakh, with two<lb/> sureties for the like amount. It is not in dispute that this is the<lb/> provision which would be applicable in the present case.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. The Supreme Court gave further directions regarding the<lb/> conditions to be imposed while granting bail, which are reproduced<lb/> below:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;15-xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx<lb/> xxxx<lb/> The directives in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall be<lb/> subject to the following general conditions:<lb/></item>

			<item>(i) The undertrial accused entitled to be released on bail<lb/> shall deposit his passport with the learned Judge of the<lb/> Special Court concerned and if he does not hold a<lb/> passport he shall file an affidavit to that effect in the form<lb/> that may be prescribed by the learned Special Judge. In<lb/> the latter case the learned Special Judge will, if he has<lb/> reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement, write to<lb/> the Passport Officer concerned to verify the statement<lb/> and the Passport Officer shall verify his record and send<lb/> a reply within three weeks. If he fails to reply within the<lb/> said time, the learned Special Judge will be entitled to act<lb/> on the statement of the undertrial accused;<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) the undertrial accused shall on being released on bail<lb/> present himself at the police station which has prosecuted<lb/> him at least once in a month in the case of those covered<lb/> under clause (i), once in a fortnight in the case of those<lb/> covered under clause (ii) and once in a week in the case<lb/> of those covered by clause (iii), unless leave of absence is<lb/> obtained in advance from the Special Judge concerned;<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) the benefit of the direction in clauses (ii) and (iii)<lb/> shall not be available to those accused persons who are,<lb/> in the opinion of the learned Special Judge, for reasons<lb/> to be stated in writing, likely to tamper with evidence or<lb/> influence the prosecution witnesses;<lb/></item>

			<item>(iv) in the case of undertrial accused who are foreigners,<lb/> the Special Judge shall, besides impounding their<lb/> passports, insist on a certificate of assurance from the<lb/> Embassy/High Commission of the country to which the<lb/> foreigner-accused belongs, that the said accused shall<lb/> not leave the country and shall appear before the Special<lb/> Court as and when required;<lb/></item>

			<item>(v) the undertrial accused shall not leave the area in<lb/> relation to which the Special Court is constituted except<lb/> with the permission of the learned Special Judge;<lb/></item>

			<item>(vi) the undertrial accused may furnish bail by depositing<lb/> cash equal to the bail amount;<lb/></item>

			<item>(vii) the Special Judge will be at liberty to cancel bail if<lb/> any of the above conditions are violated or a case for<lb/> cancellation of bail is otherwise made out; and<lb/></item>

			<item>(viii) after the release of the undertrial accused pursuant<lb/> to this order, the cases of those undertrials who have not<lb/> been released and are in jail will be accorded priority<lb/> and the Special Court will proceed with them as provided<lb/> in Section 309 of the Code.<lb/></item>

			<item>16. We may state that the above are intended to operate<lb/> as one-time directions for cases in which the accused<lb/> persons are in jail and their trials are delayed. They are<lb/> not intended to interfere with the Special Court&apos;s a power<lb/> to grant bail under Section 37 of the Act. The Special<lb/> Court will be free to exercise that power keeping in view<lb/> the complaint of inordinate delay in the disposal of the<lb/> pending cases. The Special Court will, notwithstanding<lb/> the directions, be free to cancel bail if the accused is<lb/> found to be misusing it and grounds for cancellation of<lb/> bail exist. Lastly, we grant liberty to apply in case of any<lb/> difficulty in the implementation of this order.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>16. The SCLAC judgment was cited by the Supreme Court in Thana<lb/> Singh 22 to grant bail to an accused under the Act, who was in jail for<lb/> more than 12 years.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. Three recent orders of the Supreme Court, also indicate that the<lb/> period of incarceration, and the likelihood of the trial taking a long<lb/> time, are factors to be considered while deciding applications for bail<lb/> in cases instituted under the Act. These orders are as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<p>a.<lb/> In Manoj Kumar Singh vs. State of West Bengal &amp; Anr. 23 , the<lb/> applicants therein were accused of transporting 9,310 kilograms of<lb/> ganja while dressed in army uniform and were also carrying firearms.<lb/> The Supreme Court noted the SCLAC judgment, and the fact that the<lb/> proceedings before the trial court remained pending despite several<lb/> directions of the Supreme Court and the High Court. The Court<lb/> released the applicants therein on bail on the ground that they have<lb/> served more than seven years in judicial custody.<lb/> b.<lb/> In Tapan Das vs. Union of India 24 , the Court granted bail to an<lb/> accused noting that he had been in incarceration for around four years,<lb/> and that there was no possibility of completion of the trial in the near<lb/> future.<lb/></p>

			<p>c.<lb/> In Baba Fakruddin Sheikh @ Fakru 25 , cited by Mr. Priyadarshi,<lb/> this Court denied bail, coming to a finding that a commercial quantity<lb/> of contraband had been recovered and Section 37 of the Act would<lb/> thus be attracted. This Court rejected the applicant&apos;s contention that<lb/> the recovery from the applicant alone (and not from other co-accused)<lb/> should be taken into account, which was only of 200 grams of heroin,<lb/> being an intermediate quantity under the Act. It, therefore, rejected the<lb/> application for bail, applying Section 37 of the Act. The Supreme<lb/> Court however granted bail, noting the period of incarceration, and the<lb/> unlikelihood of timely conclusion of the trial.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. In Sanawar Ali 26 , a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court,<lb/> noticed that the SCLAC judgment has specifically been applied to the<lb/> State of West Bengal. Noting the general rule in favour of grant of<lb/> bail, and coming to a conclusion that the delay in the conclusion of the<lb/> trial was not occasioned by the accused, the High Court granted bail in<lb/> that case. The Division Bench negatived the contention that SCLAC<lb/> judgment was intended to be only a &quot;one-time measure&quot;, which would<lb/> have no applicability in the present time.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. Although the SCLAC judgment has not specifically been<lb/> applied to the National Capital Territory of Delhi, the following recent<lb/> decisions of coordinate benches of this Court have applied the<lb/> principles laid down therein by the Supreme Court:-<lb/></p>

			<p>a.<lb/> In Atul Aggarwal 27 , the Court was considering an application<lb/> for bail in a case arising under the Act. The accused had been in<lb/> custody for nine years as an undertrial prisoner. The Court cited the<lb/> SCLAC judgment to release him on bail.<lb/> b.<lb/> In Kartik Dangi vs. State of NCT of Delhi 28 , the Court inter alia<lb/> noticed the decisions of the Supreme Court in SCLAC, Union of India<lb/> vs. K.A. Najeeb 29 , Manoj Kumar Singh 30 and Tapan Das 31 , and the<lb/> judgment of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in<lb/> Sanawar Ali 32 . The Court released the applicant on bail despite the<lb/> allegation of seizure of 12.6 kilograms of opium attracting the<lb/> limitations prescribed in Section 37 of the Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>c.<lb/> In Anil Kumar @ Nillu 33 , a similar conclusion was recorded,<lb/> noticing the SCLAC judgment and the judgment of the Calcutta High<lb/> Court in Sanawar Ali 34 . The argument of the prosecution that the<lb/> SCLAC judgment was a one-time measure, was rejected with the<lb/> following observations:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;12. A bare perusal of paragraph 16 indicates to this<lb/> Court that the directions were not meant to be employed<lb/> as one-time directions in the said case, but were meant to<lb/> apply as a one-time measure in all cases in which the<lb/> accused persons were in jail and their trials had been<lb/> delayed. The intention of paragraph 16 was to convey<lb/> that despite the absence or presence of delay in trial in a<lb/> case, the Special Court was still free to exercise its power<lb/> to grant bail under Section 37 of the NDPS Act.<lb/> Furthermore, if the Special Court also retained the power<lb/> to cancel bail if the accused was found to be misusing the<lb/> same. The directions were certainly not, as the learned<lb/> APP has submitted, meant to only apply in the case<lb/> therein, but were directions that were to be followed by<lb/> Courts in all cases pertaining to NDPS wherein the<lb/> accused had been subjected to prolonged delay in their<lb/> trials.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>d.<lb/> The view taken by this Court in Atul Aggarwal 35 and Anil<lb/> Kumar @ Nillu 36 has been followed in a recent judgment of this Court<lb/> in Ebera Nwanaforo vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 37 and connected<lb/> matter. After a detailed discussion of the judgments of the Supreme<lb/> Court inter alia in SCLAC, and Tofan Singh 38 , as well as the<lb/> judgments of this Court inter alia in Atul Aggarwal 39 and Anil Kumar<lb/> @ Nillu 40 , the Bench concurred with the view taken in Anil Kumar @<lb/> Nillu. The Court noted that neither Atul Aggarwal 41 , nor Anil Kumar<lb/> @ Nillu 42 was carried in appeal by the prosecuting agencies. The<lb/> applicants therein, having been incarcerated for a period of more than<lb/> eight years, were therefore released on bail. This Court expressly<lb/> rejected the argument of the prosecution that the applicants ought not<lb/> to be released on bail as they are foreign nationals, relying upon the<lb/> judgment of this Court in Lambert Kroger vs. Enforcement<lb/> Directorate 43 .<lb/></p>

			<p>20. The judgments on this point which have been cited by Mr.<lb/> Bansal do not deal with the SCLAC judgment. In Bobby Collin 44 , the<lb/> principal ground of rejection of bail was that the trial was at its final<lb/> stage, with only one prosecution witness remaining to be examined. In<lb/> Anthony Umeh 45 , although the accused had been in custody for more<lb/> than five years, the Court found that the case of improper sampling<lb/> was required to be tested during trial and not at the stage of bail. The<lb/> bail application was, therefore, rejected. In Mohd. Hanif 46 , this Court<lb/> rejected the bail application of the accused, who had been in custody<lb/> for about 4 years 9 months on the ground that a previous application<lb/> for bail had already been rejected by this Court. The case of Emeka<lb/> Charles Omuka 47 is also not a case of incarceration for the period as<lb/> laid down in the SCLAC judgment, as the applicant was in judicial<lb/> custody since 27.12.2019, and the judgment was pronounced on<lb/> 19.04.2022. In Edwin Emeka Igbowke 48 also, the period of<lb/> incarceration was of just over four years. In any event, as none of the<lb/> judgments cited by Mr. Bansal deal with the SCLAC judgment, I am<lb/> of the view that the recent judgments of coordinate benches of this<lb/> Court, particularly in Anil Kumar @ Nillu 49 , and Ebera Nwanaforo 50 ,<lb/> squarely cover the present case.<lb/></p>

			<p>21. The judgment in Achint Navinbhai Patel 51 , cited by Mr. Bansal,<lb/> proceeds on the basis that the petitioners therein were themselves<lb/> responsible, at least partially, for the delay in completion of the trial.<lb/> Although the trial had been pending for eight years, the reasons noted<lb/> by the Supreme Court 52 included the actions of the accused by filing<lb/> repeated petitions on interim matters, including bail applications,<lb/> hearing of such applications at length, and deciding the same by<lb/> elaborate judgments while staying further prosecution by the High<lb/> Court, which contributed to the delay in conclusion of the trial. The<lb/> Supreme Court noted its earlier judgments in Special Courts Bill,<lb/> 1978, In Re 53 , and in Ganesh Narayan Hegde vs. S. Bangarappa 54 , and<lb/> the facts of the case to come to the conclusion that dilatory tactics<lb/> were being adopted by the accused. The bail application was,<lb/> therefore, dismissed. In the present case, in contrast, there is no<lb/> assertion or indication in the Status Report that the accused has<lb/> delayed the proceedings of the trial. Therefore, no case is made out of<lb/> dilatory tactics on the part of the applicant, which would furnish a<lb/> ground to make an exception from the principles laid down in the<lb/> SCLAC judgment, and followed by this Court inter alia in Atul<lb/> Aggarwal 55 , Kartik Dangi 56 , Anil Kumar alias Nillu 57 and Ebera<lb/> Nwanaforo 58 .<lb/></p>

			<p>22. As far as the legality of the sampling procedure is concerned,<lb/> having regard to the judgment of this Court in Anthony Umeh 59 , and<lb/> the other judgments cited by Mr. Bansal on this point, I accept his<lb/> contention that this question cannot be adjudicated at this stage, and it<lb/> has to be determined at the end of the trial. However, to the extent that<lb/> the prosecution relies upon the extra judicial confessions of the<lb/> accused and of another co-accused, recorded under Section 67 of the<lb/> Act, the judgment of the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh 60 holds that<lb/> such confessions are inadmissible in evidence. This point has been<lb/> considered in several judgments of this Court while granting bail in<lb/> cases under the Act. Reference by way of example may be made to the<lb/> order of this Court in Amans Osaretin vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 61 ,<lb/> and the judgment in Ebera Nwanaforo 62 .<lb/></p>

			<p>23. The argument of Mr. Bansal that a different consideration<lb/> would apply in the case of foreigners also does not commend to me.<lb/> The judgments noted above in Lambert Kroger 63 and Ebera<lb/> Nwanaforo 64 conclude this issue against the prosecution. In the<lb/> SCLAC judgment also, the Supreme Court expressly dealt with the<lb/> question of grant of bail to foreigners accused under the Act. In any<lb/> event, in the present case, the undisputed position is that, although the<lb/> applicant himself is a foreign citizen, he is married to a citizen of<lb/> India, and has a child who is also resident in New Delhi. I was<lb/> informed during the course of hearing that his address in Delhi has<lb/> also been verified by the IO. The applicant can, therefore, be seen to<lb/> have roots in the society, despite his citizenship status.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. For the reasons aforesaid, as the applicant has been in custody<lb/> for eight years already, six PWs are yet to be examined, and on the<lb/> consideration of the various factors noted above, including the<lb/> provision of Section 37 of the Act, as interpreted in the above<lb/> judgments of the Supreme Court and this Court, I am of the view that<lb/> the applicant is entitled to be released on bail.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>25. It is, therefore, directed that the applicant herein be admitted to<lb/> bail in relation to Sessions Case No. 9080/2016, registered by the<lb/> NCB under Sections 8(c), 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the Act, subject to the<lb/> following conditions:-<lb/></p>

			<p>A.<lb/> The applicant will furnish a personal bond in the sum of ₹1<lb/> lakh, with two sureties in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the<lb/> Special Court/Duty Magistrate.<lb/></p>

			<p>B.<lb/> The applicant&apos;s passport will be deposited with the Special<lb/> Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>C.<lb/> The applicant will present himself at the office of the NCB<lb/> every Monday at 11:00 am, and will be released within one hour after<lb/> completion of the formalities. Exemption from this requirement may<lb/> be granted by the Special Court in exceptional circumstances.<lb/></p>

			<p>D.<lb/> The Special Court will seek a certificate of assurance from the<lb/> High Commission of Nigeria, New Delhi, that the accused shall not<lb/> leave the country till the trial is concluded, and shall appear before the<lb/> Special Court on each and every date, unless exempted by the Special<lb/> Court in exceptional circumstances. The applicant will not be released<lb/> on bail in the absence of such a certificate of assurance.<lb/></p>

			<p>E.<lb/> The applicant will reside at the address mentioned in the<lb/> chargesheet which has been verified by the IO. In the event of any<lb/> change in his address, the applicant will give prior information of the<lb/> same to the IO and the Special Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>F.<lb/> The applicant will give his mobile number to the IO, and ensure<lb/> that the mobile number is kept in working condition, and is<lb/> operational at all times.<lb/></p>

			<p>G.<lb/> The applicant will drop a pin on Google Maps to ensure that his<lb/> exact location is available with the IO at all times.<lb/></p>

			<p>H.<lb/> The applicant will not tamper with the evidence, directly or<lb/> indirectly, in any manner.<lb/></p>

			<p>I.<lb/> The applicant will not contact any of the prosecution witnesses<lb/> or act in any other manner prejudicial to the trial.<lb/></p>

			<p>J.<lb/> In the event any further offence is registered against the<lb/> applicant during the period he is out on bail, the NCB is at liberty to<lb/> apply to the Special Court for cancellation of the bail granted to the<lb/> applicant.<lb/></p>

			<p>K.<lb/> The Special Court will also be at liberty to cancel the bail of the<lb/> applicant on account of any violation of the conditions laid down in<lb/> this order.<lb/></p>

			<p>26. The Special Court is directed to conclude the trial as<lb/> expeditiously as possible and practicable, and preferably by<lb/> 31.12.2022.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. It is made clear that the observations made hereinabove are only<lb/> for the purposes of disposal of the present bail application, and will<lb/> not prejudice the parties at trial.<lb/></p>

			<p>28. The application stands disposed of with the aforesaid directions.<lb/></p>

			<p>29. A copy of this order be communicated electronically forthwith<lb/> to the concerned Jail Superintendent for information.<lb/></p>

			<p>PRATEEK JALAN, J<lb/></p>
