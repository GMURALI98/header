			<body>they do not possess the qualification has been declined and the writ <lb/>petitions have been dismissed with certain observations. <lb/>2. We had heard the arguments that had been advanced by <lb/>the learned counsel for the parties on 22.11.2019, whereupon we <lb/>had passed the following order: <lb/>&quot;Heard learned counsel for the parties. <lb/>2. We find from the submissions that have been <lb/>advanced that the basic issue involved is with regard to <lb/>the eligibility qualifications being possessed by the <lb/>appellants, who contend that their candidature could <lb/>not have been declared to be not in accordance with <lb/>the qualifications prescribed inasmuch as the <lb/>certificates possessed by them are in conformity with <lb/>law and heavy reliance has been placed on the Division <lb/>Bench judgment dated 20.08.2019 to contend that the <lb/>respondents are bound to apply the ratio of the said <lb/>judgment in the case of the appellants as well. <lb/>3. The question as to whether the appellants are in <lb/>possession of the qualifications or not is being debated <lb/>before us on the ground that the qualifications <lb/>possessed by them should be treated to be equivalent <lb/>___________ <lb/>Page 3 of 15 <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">W.A.No.3812 of 2019 etc. batch <lb/></note>

			<body>as per the norms adopted by the Government itself in <lb/>the past to the qualifications prescribed in the <lb/>Notification dated 26.07.2017. <lb/>4. We, prima facie, find that the Notification dated <lb/>26.07.2017 does not appear to have been challenged <lb/>and the appellants had applied under the same <lb/>Notification supporting their candidature by the <lb/>qualifications that they possessed. The question of <lb/>equivalence therefore has to be gathered either from <lb/>the recitals contained in the Notification or even <lb/>otherwise if the appellants are able to satisfy the Court <lb/>that they are in possession of the equivalent <lb/>qualification. <lb/>5. Learned counsel for the appellants pray that the <lb/>matter may be adjourned for today to enable them to <lb/>prepare a Chart and then proceed with the matter <lb/>keeping in view the nature of queries that had been <lb/>raised by the Bench. <lb/>Put up on 06.12.2019, as prayed for.&quot; <lb/>3. The matter was adjourned on 6.12.2019 by the following <lb/>___________ <lb/>Page 4 of 15 <lb/>http://www.judis.nic.in <lb/></body>

			<body>5. A perusal of the above Government Orders shows that they <lb/>are in compliance of the directions issued by the High Court <lb/>(Madurai Bench), whereafter an Equivalence Committee was <lb/>constituted and the Equivalence Committee vide its meetings, as <lb/>referred in the Government Orders, proceeded to grant equivalence <lb/>in the manner indicated therein.
