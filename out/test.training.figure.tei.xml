            <figDesc>Section 3-Y(1) of the Slum Act provides that the State Government or<lb/> any ofcer generally or specially authorised by it is required to issue a<lb/> photopass to the actual occupier of the dwelling structure in slum<lb/> which is in existence on or prior to 1st January, 1995. Section 3-X(c)<lb/> provides that &quot;Protected occupier&quot; means an occupier of dwelling<lb/> structure who holds a photopass. Sub-section (1) of section 3-Z<lb/> provides that save as provided in sub section (2) of section 3-Z no<lb/> protected occupier shall be evicted from a dwelling structure. Sub-<lb/>section (2) provides that the State Government in larger public interest<lb/> can evict protected occupier from his dwelling structure subject to<lb/> condition of relocating and rehabilitating the protected occupier in<lb/> accordance with the scheme or schemes prepared by the State<lb/> Government in this behalf. Section 3-X(a) defnes a &quot;dwelling<lb/> structure&quot; to mean a structure used as a dwelling or otherwise and<lb/> includes an out-house, shed, hut or other enclosure or structure,<lb/> whether of bricks, masonry, wood, mud, metal or any other material<lb/> whatsoever. Thus, occupants of the structures in slum area become<lb/> protected occupiers provided as on 1st January, 1995 they are in<lb/> occupation of a dwelling structure.</figDesc>
