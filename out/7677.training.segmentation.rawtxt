1. 
This judgment disposes of IA 15352/2019 in CS(Comm) 

611/2019 and IA 2084/2021 in CS(Comm) 69/2021. The captioned 

application has, in each case, been filed by the common plaintiff FMC 

Corporation (who would be referred to, in this judgment, as "the 

plaintiff"), against the defendant Natco Pharma Ltd in CS(Comm) 

611/2019 and against the defendant Best Crop Science LLP in CS 

(Comm)69/2021, under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of 

Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). 

2. 
In each case, the plaintiff asserts its product patent IN 201307 

("IN'307", in short) and its process patent IN 213332 ("IN'332", in 

short), which relate to the product Chlorantraniliprole (also known as 

"CTPR") and the process for the preparation thereof. The plaintiff 

alleges that the defendants are proposing to infringe the suit patents by 

manufacturing and releasing, in the market, their own CTPR products, 

even while the suit patents continue to be alive and without obtaining 

any license from the plaintiff. Injunction, against the defendants from 

doing so has, therefore, been sought in the plaints.

The applications under Order XXXIX of the CPC, which this 

judgment disposes of, seeks interim injunction against the 

infringement of the suit patents by the defendants. 

4. 
For ease of reference, discussion in this judgment, would 

pertain principally to the facts relevant to CS (Comm) 611/2019 and 

IA 15352/2019, preferred therein. As such, the expression 

"defendant" would refer to the defendant in CS (Comm) 611/2019, 

i.e. Natco Pharma Ltd. 

A. 
Re. IN'307 

Facts 

5. 
The plaintiff sets up the following case in the plaint: 

(i) 
The plaintiff applied to the Patent Office in India, on 17 th 

May, 2005, for grant of patent in respect of CTPR, of which the 

plaintiff claimed to be the inventor. The date of publication of 

the application, under Section 11A 1 of the Patents Act, 1970 

1 The relevant sub-sections of Section 11A read thus: 

"11A. 
Publication of applications -
(1) 
Save as otherwise provided, no application for patent shall ordinarily be open to 
the public for such period as may be prescribed. 
(2) 
The applicant may, in the prescribed manner, request the Controller to publish 
his application at any time before the expiry of the period prescribed under sub-section 
(1) and subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), the Controller shall publish such 
application as soon as possible. 
(3) 
Every application for patent shall, on the expiry of the period specified under 
sub-section (1), be published, except in cases where the application -


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 4 of 174 

was declared as 30 th September, 2005, and priority dates 2 

relatable to applications US 60/311, 919; US 60/324, 128; and 

US 60/369, 661, were declared as 13 th August, 2001, 21 st 

September, 2001 and 2 nd April, 2002. The title of the 

application was "Arthropodicial Anthranilamides". 3 

(ii) The application was subsequently allowed, resulting in 

grant, to the plaintiff, of the suit patent IN'307, covering 15 

(a) 
in which secrecy direction is imposed under section 35; or 
(b) 
has been abandoned under sub-section (1) of section 9; or 
(c) 
has been withdrawn three months prior to the period specified under 
sub-section (1)." 

"Prescribed" is defined, under Section 2(u) as, in cases other than those relating to proceedings before the 
High Court or the IPAB, "prescribed by rules made under this Act". 

Rule 24 of the Patents Rules, 2003, stipulates the period, under Section 11A (1) as 18 months from the date 
of filing of the application or the priority date of the application, whichever is earlier. 

Rule 24A requires the applicant to file a request for publication, under Section 11A(2) in Form 9. 

2 Section 7 (1) of the Patents Act requires every application for a patent to be only for one invention. 

Subsections (1A) and (1B) of Section 7 read thus: 
"(1A) 
Every international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty for a 
patent, as may be filed designating India shall be deemed to be an application under this 
Act, if a corresponding application has also been filed before the Controller in India. 
(1B) 
The filing date of an application referred to in sub-section (1A) and its 
complete specification processed by the patent office as designated office or elected 
office shall be the International filing date accorded under the Patent Cooperation 
Treaty." 

"Priority date" is defined, in Section 2(w) as having "the meaning assigned to it by section 11". 

Subsections (1) and (6) (the interceding sub-sections being irrelevant for the purposes of the present case) of 
Section 11 read thus: 
"11. 
Priority dates of claims of a complete specification -
(1) There shall be a priority date for each claim of a complete specification. 
***** 
(6)In any case with sub-sections (2), (3), (3A), (4) and (5) do not apply, the priority date 
of a claim shall, subject to the provisions of section 137, be the date of filing of the 
complete specification." 

"The date of filing of the complete specification" in cases where, for the same invention, international 
applications for grant of patent had earlier been filed by the applicant, or by its predecessor in interest, 
necessarily had to be reckoned in accordance with sub-sections (1A) and (1B) of Section 7. 

3 Section 10(1) of the Patents Act requires every specification to "describe the invention and shall begin with 

a title sufficiently indicating the subject matter to which the invention relates." 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 5 of 174 

claims. 4 Of these, the plaintiff submits that CTPR was covered 

by Claims 1 to 6 and 8 to 10, particularly Claims 1, 8 and 9, and 

was specifically exemplified as the tenth compound in Claim 8. 

Of these, 

a) Claim 1 was a Markush structure 5 , and read thus: 

"A compound selected from Formula 1 or an N-
oxide thereof 

wherein 
R 1 is CH3, F, Cl or Br; 
R 2 is F, Cl, Br, I or CF3; 
R 3 is CF3, Cl, Br or OCH2CF3; 
R 4a is C1-C4 alkyl; 
R 4b is H or CH3; and 
R 5 is Cl or Br; 
or an agriculturally suitable salt thereof." 

b) the tenth compound in Claim 8 was described thus: 

4 Section 10(4) stipulates that "every complete specification shall -

(a) 
fully and particularly described the invention and its operation or use and the method by 
which it is to be performed; 
(b) 
disclose the best method of performing the invention which is known to the applicant and 
for which he is entitled to claim protection; and 
(c) 
end with a claim of claims defining the scope of the invention for which protection is 
claimed; 
(d) 
be accompanied by an abstract to provide technical information on the invention:" 

5 "Markush claims", or claims covering "Markush structures", which are common in patents for chemical 

entities, whether agricultural or pharmaceutical, are molecular structures which "cover a group of 
compounds, which disclose the possibility of individual permutations and combinations that can run into 
several million (if not more) structurally diverse compounds." [as defined in Astrazeneca AB v. Intas 
Pharmaceuticals, 2020 (84) PTC 326 (Del)] 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 6 of 174 

"A compound as claimed in claim 1 that is 
selected from the group: 

***** 
the compound of Formula 1 wherein R 1 is CH3, 
R 2 is Cl, R 3 is Br, R 4a is CH3, R 4b is H and R 5 is 

Cl;", and 

c) Claim 9 read as under: 

"A composition for controlling invertebrate pest 
comprising a biologically effective amount of a 
compound as claimed in claim 1 and at least 
one additional component selected from the 
group consisting of surfactants, solid diluents 
and liquid diluents." 

(iii) CTPR, which bears the chemical structure 

stands specifically exemplified in Example 6 of the Complete 

specifications of the suit patent, as granted, which reads as 

under: 

"EXAMPLE 6 

Preparation of 3 -bromo -N -[4 -chloro -2 -methyl -
6 -[(methylamino) carbonyl] phenyl] -1 -(3 -chloro 
-2-pyridinyl) -1H -pyrazole -5-carboxamide 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 7 of 174 

To a solution of 2 -[3 -bromo -l -(3 -chloro -2 -
pyridinyl) -lH -pyrazol -5 -yl] -6 -chloro -8 -
methyl -4H -3,l -benzoxazin -4 -one (i.e. the 
benzoxazinone product of Example 5, Step E) (0.20 g, 
0.44 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran was added methylamine 
(2.0 M solution in THF, 0.514 mL, 1.02 mmol), and 
the reaction mixture was heated to 60 o C for 90 minutes 
and then cooled to room temperature. 
The 
tetrahydrofuran solvent was evaporated under reduced 
pressure, and the residual solid was triturated with 
ether, filtered, and dried to afford the title compound, a 
compound of the present invention, as a solid (40 mg), 
m.p. 162-164 o C." 

(iv) Thus, the Markush structure, along with the necessary 

radicals to be substituted therein, the method of preparation and 

the actual and precise molecular structure and formula of 

CTPR, stands specifically claimed in the suit patent IN'307. 

CTPR is, additionally, one of 148 compounds specifically 

exemplified in the suit patent. The defendant does not dispute 

this position. The plaintiff claims that the 3-substituted-2-

pyridyl ring, with two substituents on the phenyl ring, results in 

compounds with superior insecticidal activity. This superior 

insecticidal activity is also explained under the head "Biological 

Examples of the Invention", in the suit patent. The plaint 

asserts that the compounds disclosed in the suit patent IN'307 

are first of a kind, novel anthranilic diamide insecticides which 

are ryanodine receptor activators. CTPR, it is asserted, 

activates the ryanodine receptor in the pest by stimulating the 

release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of its 

muscle cells, resulting in impaired regulation, paralysis and 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 8 of 174 

death. The superior and selective action of these insecticides 

against the ryanodine receptor in pests also results in low 

mammalian toxicity. 

(v) IN'307 is a subsisting patent, the life of which would 

expire on 13 th August, 2022 (reckoning 20 years from 13 th 

August, 2002, when the patent was granted). No pre-grant or 

post-grant opposition, to the suit patent, was filed by anyone, 

including the defendant. 
The plaint also asserts that 

counterparts of the suit patent had been granted in more than 40 

countries, in all of which they continue to subsist till date, 

Colombia being the sole jurisdiction where the equivalent of the 

suit patent was invalidated. 

(vi) IN'332, which was the process patent, was filed on 8 th 

January, 2004, published on 15 th December, 2006 and granted 

on 27 th December, 2007. Priority dates were claimed, in respect 

of the claims in IN'332 as 13 th August, 2001, 21 st September, 

2001 and 2 nd April, 2002, on the basis of US 919, US 128 and 

US 661 respectively. The title of the patent was "A process for 

preparing a compound of Formula 1". It is not in dispute that 

the process for making CTPR is covered by IN'332. The 

plaintiff asserts that Claim 1 in IN'332 discloses the process for 

preparation of CTPR, whereas Claims 2 to 22 disclose the 

processual steps for arriving at the reactants used in Claim 1. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 9 of 174 

IN'332 would remain alive till 13 th August, 2022, reckoning 20 

years from 13 th August, 2002. 

(vii) No pre-grant or post-grant opposition was filed in 

relation to IN'332. Moreover, the counterparts of IN'332 had 

been granted patents in over 40 countries, in none of which 

have they been revoked or invalidated. 

(viii) Having thus set out the specifics of the suit patents 

IN'307 and IN'332, the plaint adverts to IN 204978 ("IN'978" 

in short) which, fundamentally, forms the focus of controversy 

in the present case. IN'978 contains a Markush formula, from 

which the compounds in Formula 1 of IN'307 are asserted to be 

a novel and inventive selection. The plaint acknowledges that 

CTPR falls within the scope of the numerous compounds, and 

is in the class of anthranilamides, included in the Markush 

formula, disclosed and claimed in the patent IN'978, but 

asserts, with equal emphasis, that CTPR is not specifically 

disclosed in IN'978 and that no person skilled in the art would 

be able to synthesise CTPR based on the claim and disclosure 

in IN'978. 

(ix) Reliance is placed, in the plaint, on the declaration filed 

with the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO), during 

the prosecution of US'836, the counterpart in the US of IN'307. 

The declaration refers to tests conducted, to compare the 

compounds claimed and disclosed in IN'307, with their closest 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 10 of 174 

counterparts disclosed in IN'978. These tests indicated superior 

insecticidal activity of the compounds disclosed in IN'307 vis-

à-vis their closest counterparts disclosed in IN'978. 

(x) As such, the plaint asserts that a person skilled in the art 

would not arrive at CTPR from Formula 22 in IN'978 without 

human intervention and ingenuity and application of hindsight 

knowledge. 

(xi) IN'307 stands worked in India, as CTPR is duly 

registered with the Central Insecticide Board under Section 9(3) 

of the Insecticides Act, 1968 6 , for (i) "Chlorantraniliprole 

technical for import, (ii) Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % w/w SC for 

indigenous manufacture which is marketed by the plaintiff 

under 
the 
brand 
name 
CORAGEN®, 
and 
(iii) 

Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR for indigenous manufacture which 

is marketed by the plaintiff under the brand name 

6 "9. 
Registration of insecticides: 

***** 
(3) 
On receipt of any such application for the registration of an insecticide, the 
Committee may, after such enquiry as it deems fit and after satisfying itself that the 
insecticide to which the application relates conforms to the claims made by the importer 
or by the manufacturer, as the case may be, as regards the efficacy of the insecticide and 
its safety to human beings and animals, register [on such conditions as may be specified 
by it] and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed, the insecticide, allot a 
registration number thereto and issue a certificate of registration in token thereof within a 
period of twelve months from the date of receipt of the application: 

Provided that the Committee may, if it is unable within the said period to arrive at a 
decision on the basis of the materials placed before it, extend the period by a further 
period not exceeding six months: 

Provided further that if the Committee is of opinion that the precautions claimed by the applicant as 
being sufficient to ensure safety to human beings or animals are not such as can be easily observed 
or that notwithstanding the observance of such precautions the use of the insecticide involves 
serious risk to human beings or animals, it may refuse to register the insecticide." 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 11 of 174 

FERTERRA®." The application of the plaintiff for substituting 

M/s FMC India Pvt. Ltd., the affiliate company of Plaintiff No. 

1 in India, as the current registrant of these insecticides, stands 

approved by the Central Insecticides Board and Registration 

Committee on 4 th October, 2019. 

(xii) As such, the plaintiff claims the exclusive rights to 

manufacture, use, market or sell CTPR in India. No third party 

can manufacture, sell or distribute CTPR in India without a 

valid license from the plaintiff. 

(xiii) In October 2019, the plaintiff claims to have learnt of the 

imminent launch, by the defendant, of a CTPR product, which 

would infringe the suit patents IN'307 and IN'332. An 

application for "improved process for the preparation of 

anthranilimide derivatives" has also been filed by the defendant 

before the Indian Patent Office. This application allegedly 

provides for an improved process for preparation of CTPR. Any 

manufacture of CTPR, by such allegedly novel process would 

result in infringement of IN'307, which, as already noted 

hereinbefore, specifically claims CTPR in Claim 8. 

(xiv) The plaint also adverts to a suit filed by the defendant 

under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, before the 

City Civil Court, Hyderabad, ("the Hyderabad suit" in short). It 

is asserted, in the plaint, that the said suit is an abuse of process 

of law and is jurisdictionally incompetent. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 12 of 174 

6. 
The plaint, thus, seeks a permanent injunction against 

infringement, by the defendant, of the suit patents IN'307 and IN'332. 

The present application seeks interlocutory directions in that regard. 

The prayer clause in the application reads as under: 

"17. In light of the foregoing, it is most humbly prayed that 
the following interim reliefs may be granted by this Hon'ble 
Court 

(i) 
An order of ex parte ad interim injunction 
restraining all the Defendant, its directors, employees, 
officers, servants, agents and all others acting for and 
on their behalf from manufacturing, using, selling, 
distributing, advertising, exporting, offering for sale, 
and in any other manner, directly or indirectly, dealing 
in any product that infringes the claimed subject matter 
of the Plaintiff's Indian Patent No 201307, including 
the product CHLORANTRANILIPROLE; 

(ii) 
An order of ex parte ad interim injunction 
restraining Defendant, its directors, employees, 
officers, servants, agents and all others acting for and 
on their behalf from using, directly or indirectly, any of 
the processes claimed under Indian Patent No. 213332; 
and 

(iii) Any other Order(s) as this Hon'ble Court may 
deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of 
the case." 

Rival Stands 

7. 
A detailed written statement has been filed by the defendant. 

Arguments, in this matter, continued over several days, with the 

plaintiff initially being represented by Mr. Pravin Anand and, later, by 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 13 of 174 

Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel, instructed by Mr. Sanjay 

Kumar. Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned Counsel, addressed arguments on 

behalf of the defendant. 

(i) 
Copious written submissions running into several pages, 

with accompanying charts and other materials have been filed. 

They are so exhaustive, and cover the arguments advanced at 

the Bar by the learned Counsel so comprehensively, that it is 

not necessary to refer to the contents of the written statement or 

replication. 

(ii) Given the nature of the controversy, it would be 

appropriate to set out, seriatim, each of the grounds on which 

the defendant contests the suit and the response of the plaintiff 

thereto, side by side. This is because the entire case of the 

defendant is premised on Section 107(1) of the Patents Act 7 , 

which permits the raising, in defence to an allegation of patent 

infringement, of every ground on the basis of which the 

plaintiff's suit patent may be revoked. As such, the case of the 

defendant is not that it does not propose to launch CTPR 

products in India, as would infringe IN'307 but, rather, that 

IN'307 is itself an invalid patent, and is liable to be revoked. 

(iii) 
Patent rights are, classically, statutory and territorial in 

nature. Unlike trademark rights, which also draw sustenance 

7 "107. Defences, etc., in suit for infringement. -

(1) 
In any suit for infringement of a patent, every ground on which it may be 
revoked under section 64 shall be available as a ground for defence." 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 14 of 174 

from common law, the right to grant of patent, as well as the 

rights to have an infringing patent revoked, must emanate from 

the Patents Act. Section 64 of the Patents Act provides for the 

grounds on which a patent may be revoked. Of the various 

grounds enumerated therein, those which the defendant, in the 

present case, seeks to invoke, may, for ready reference, be 

reproduced as under: 

"64. Revocation of patents -

(1) 
Subject to the provisions contained in 
this Act, a patent, whether granted before or 
after the commencement of this Act, may, be 
revoked on a petition of any person interested or 
of the Central Government by the Appellate 
Board or on a counter-claim in a suit for 
infringement of the patent by the High Court on 
any of the following grounds, that is to say -

(a) 
that the invention, so far as 
claimed in any claim of the complete 
specification, was claimed in a valid 
claim of the earlier priority date 
contained in the complete specification 
of another patent granted in India; 

***** 

(d) 
that the subject of any claim of the 
complete specification is not an 
invention within the meaning of this Act; 

(e) 
that the invention so far as 
claimed in any claim of the complete 
specification is not new, having regard to 
what was publicly known or publicly 
used in India before the priority date of 
the claim or to what was published in 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 15 of 174 

India or elsewhere in any of the 
documents referred to in section 13: 

(f) 
that the invention so far as 
claimed in any claim of the complete 
specification is obvious or does not 
involve any inventive step, having regard 
to what was publicly known or publicly 
used in India or what was published in 
India or elsewhere before the priority 
date of the claim; 

***** 

(k) 
that the subject of any claim of the 
complete specification is not patentable 
under this Act;" 

(iv) In this context, Mr. Sai Deepak has also emphasized the 

position that the defendant, in order to succeed in a defence 

against the challenge of infringement, is only required to put up 

a credible challenge, which would suffice to show that the suit 

patent is vulnerable. The moment a credible challenge, which 

discloses vulnerability of the suit patent to revocation is made 

out by the defendant, Mr. Sai Deepak would contend, the 

plaintiffs' case for an interlocutory injunction has necessarily to 

fail. In this context, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on the judgment of a 

Division Bench of this Court in F. Hoffman-La Roche v. 

Cipla 8 . 

(v) Learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff, fairly, does not 

dispute the position, in law, that if the defendant is able to make 

8 2009 (110) DRJ 452 (DB) 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 16 of 174 

out a credible case of vulnerability of the suit patent to 

revocation, no interlocutory injunction, against infringement 

(or, more properly, exploitation) of the suit patent, can be 

granted. 

(vi) Given the fact that the defendant does not dispute its 

intent to manufacture and market CTPR, and essentially seeks 

to assail the validity of the suit patent IN'307, it would be 

appropriate to examine, seriatim, the contentions of the 

defendant, vis-à-vis the response of the plaintiff thereto. 

8. 
Non-assertion, by the plaintiff, of IN'978: 

8.1 Mr. Sai Deepak has emphasised the fact that the plaintiff has 

not chosen to assert IN'978, or any Claim therein including Claim 22. 

Mr. Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff, on the other hand, 

is categorical that his client is not asserting IN'978 in the present 

proceedings, which are limited to asserting IN'307 and IN'332. 

8.2 To my mind, this is essentially a non-issue. It is for the plaintiff 

to decide what it chooses to assert. The plaintiff has asserted IN'307 

and IN'332, and the task of this Court is to examine the merits of the 

said assertion. That the plaintiff has not chosen to assert, in these 

proceedings, IN'978, quite obviously cannot amount to any kind of an 

acknowledgement, on the plaintiff's part, regarding the vulnerability 

of IN'978 to challenge or revocation -which is why I regard this as a 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 17 of 174 

non-issue in the present proceedings. According to the plaintiff, 

IN'978 neither claims, nor discloses, CTPR and does not, therefore, in 

any manner invalidate IN'307 or any of the claims therein including 

Claim 1. In view of this stand, no occasion, obviously, arose for the 

plaintiff to assert IN'978. 

8.3 Nothing, therefore, turns, in my opinion, on the fact that the 

plaintiff has not asserted IN'978 in the present proceedings. Nor can 

this fact assist the case of the defendant. It would be for the defendant 

to establish, independently, that IN'307 is vulnerable, whether on the 

ground of IN'978 or on any other ground. 

9. 
Presumptive validity of a granted patent -Section 13(4) 

9.1 Mr. Sai Deepak submits, relying on Section 13(4) of the Patents 

Act 9 , that the statutory dispensation as it obtains in this country with 

respect to patents does not envisage any presumptive validity of a 

patent, on it being granted. He relies, for the purpose, on Bishwanath 

Prasad Radhey Shyam v. Hindustan Metal Industries 10 . Mr. Sai 

Deepak, in fact, carries the argument to the point of submitting that 

any decision, of this Court or any other Court, which presumes a 

9 "13. 
Search for anticipation by previous publication and by prior claim -
***** 
(4) 
The examination and investigations required under section 12 and this section 
shall not be deemed in any way to warrant the validity of any patent, and no liability shall 
be incurred by the Central Government or any officer thereof by reason of, or in 
connection with, any such examination or investigation or any report or other proceedings 
consequent thereon." 

10 (1979) 2 SCC 511 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 18 of 174 

patent to be valid because it has been granted, is per incuriam, in view 

of para 32 of Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam 10 . 

9.2 Disregarding of judicial precedents on the ground that they are 

per incuriam is not a decision which is to be lightly taken, as it 

compromises consistency and certainty in the law. Having said that, it 

is equally true that the judgment of a Court, which is contrary to a 

decision by a hierarchically superior Court, is per incuriam, if it 

proceeds in ignorance of the earlier decision or consciously enunciates 

the law contrary thereto without distinguishing the decision. 

9.3 A plain reading of para 32 of Bishwanath Prasad Radhey 

Shyam 10 reveals that Mr. Sai Deepak is not correct in his submission. 

The Supreme Court has not, in the said paragraph, disturbed, in any 

manner, the presumption of validity of a granted patent. It merely 

states that "the grant and sealing of the patent, or the decision 

rendered by the Controller in the case of opposition, does not 

guarantee the validity of the patent, which could be challenged before 

the High Court on various grounds in revocation or infringement 

proceedings". To this proposition, there can obviously be no cavil. 

There is, however, an obvious etymological difference between a 

"guarantee of validity" and a "presumption of validity". Grant of 

patent cannot, obviously, guarantee its validity; else, a granted patent 

would become immune from challenge. It is inconceivable that such a 

contention could even be urged, far less countenanced. Mr. Sethi 

submits that, while grant of a patent does not guarantee its validity, 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 19 of 174 

there is, to an extent that the defendant assailing the patent would 

have to produce cogent material to support the challenge, a 

presumption that, in the absence of a credible challenge, the patent is 

valid. Mr. Sethi has also drawn my attention to judgments which have 

taken the fact that a patent was granted as a point in favour of its 

validity. 

9.4 Section 13(4), too, does not deal with presumption of validity 

of a granted patent. It states that "the examination and investigations 

required under section 12 and this section shall not be deemed in any 

way to warrant the validity of any patent". The expression used here 

is, once again, "warrant" which, etymologically, is akin to the 

expression used by the Supreme Court, i.e. "guarantee". Grant of 

patent, or the extent to which the application for such grant has been 

subjected to examination, investigation or scrutiny prior to the grant, 

cannot and does not either guarantee or warrant its validity. Mr. Sethi 

is, however, correct that, once the patent is granted, the onus to make 

out a credible challenge to its validity would rest squarely on the 

defendant. 

9.5 I do not deem it necessary to devote any further time to this 

aspect, as it is nobody's case that, merely by a patent being granted, 

the Court can avoid examining the merits of the challenge to its 

validity. In any event, as I am proceeding to examine the contentions 

of Mr. Sai Deepak on merits, the issue of presumed validity 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 20 of 174 

consequent on grant of a patent need not burden this judgment any 

further. 

10. Standard of challenge 

10.1 Mr. Sai Deepak contends that, at the interlocutory stage, the 

defendant is not required to prove, to the hilt, the invalidity of the suit 

patent. The defendant is only required to set up a credible challenge 

to the vulnerability of the suit patent. Mr. Sethi, for the plaintiff, does 

not dispute this position. He, however, refers me to the judgment of 

Dr. S. Muralidhar, J. (as he then was), sitting singly, in Strix v. 

Maharaja Appliances 11 , which delineates the "standard of credibility" 

of the challenge which the defendant is required to pose, to the 

validity of the suit patent. 

10.2 The plaintiff in Strix 11 asserted a patent granted in respect of a 

liquid heating vessel with certain special characteristics, and alleged 

infringement of the patent by the defendant. One of the principal 

defences to the challenge, as raised by the defendant, was that the 

plaintiff's patent was earlier taught by a European patent which, 

therefore, constituted prior art and divested the plaintiff's patent of 

novelty. Without entering into the niceties of the challenge, suffice it 

to state that this Court found that the invention patented by the 

European patent was different from the subject matter of the suit 

patent asserted by the plaintiff and that, therefore, the European patent 

11 2009 SCC OnLine Del 2825 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 21 of 174 

could not be regarded as, prima facie, prior art which taught the 

plaintiff's invention. Paras 21 to 23 of the report alone are relevant 

and may, therefore, be reproduced as under: 

"21. The essential difference between the product 
manufactured using the Strix patent and the product made 
using the European Patent is this: the Strix patent product is a 
temperature control device which is linked to the element 
itself and, therefore, when the element reaches a certain 
temperature, the circuit is broken, and the device is switched 
off. This prevents the overheating of the element itself. 
Therefore, even if there is no liquid in the vessel and the 
vessel is switched on, the element will not get damaged on 
account of overheating. As far as the European Patent is 
concerned, its mechanism operates by the temperature control 
device sensing the temperature of the liquid and not of the 
element. If there is no liquid in the vessel, the sensor will not 
get activated and therefore the overheating of the element 
cannot be avoided thus leading to it being damaged. It cannot, 
therefore, prima facie be said that the Strix Patent is not an 
inventive step over the European Patent and, therefore, is not 
patentable as such. Of course, these are only tentative views 
at an interlocutory stage. A final view will be taken by the 
Court, at the end of the trial, upon an independent assessment 
of the evidence, uninfluenced by this order. 

22. 
It was contended by learned counsel for the Defendant 
that at an interlocutory stage, the Defendant should be held to 
have discharged its burden of raising a 'credible challenge' to 
the validity of the Plaintiff's patent by merely pointing out the 
existence of the European Patent. This court is unable to 
agree. In order to raise a credible challenge to the validity of 
a patent, even at an interlocutory stage, the Defendant will 
have to place on record some acceptable scientific material, 
supported or explained by the evidence of an expert, that the 
Plaintiff's patent is prima facie vulnerable to revocation. The 
burden on the Defendant here is greater on account of the 
fact that there was no opposition, pre-grant or post-grant, to 
the Plaintiff's patent. In Beecham Group Ltd v. Bristol 
Laboratories Pty Ltd (1967-68) 118 CLR 618 and Australian 
Broadcasting Corporation v. O'Neill (2006) 229 ALR 457 it 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 22 of 174 

was held that the defendant alleging invalidity bears the onus 
of establishing that there is "a serious question" to be tried. 
In Hexal Australia Pty Ltd. v. Roche Therapeutics Inc. 66 
IPR 325 it was held that where the validity of a patent is 
raised in interlocutory proceedings, "the onus lies on the 
party asserting invalidity to show that want of validity is a 
triable question." 

23. 
In the instant case, the prior art cited by the Defendant, 
i.e. the European Patent, is not even prima facie a prior art 
that teaches the Plaintiff's invention. It works on a very 
different principle. Further, the Defendant has been unable to 
show that the Chinese supplier from whom it is purchasing 
the infringing product, holds a patent for it. It is not even the 
Defendant's case that the said product per se does not infringe 
the Plaintiff's patent. The only defence is that the Plaintiff's 
patent lacks novelty and its validity is vulnerable on the 
ground of obviousness. This, for the reasons already 
discussed, has not even prima facie been established by the 
Defendant. It is not possible to agree with the contention that 
the Plaintiff's patent is a mere trade variant of a known 
product. The Plaintiff has been able to prima facie show that 
it has been validly granted the patent which appears to be an 
inventive step in comparison with the prior art cited by the 
Defendant, viz., the European Patent. There is no merit in the 
contention that in terms of Section 3(f) of the Act, the patent 
ought not to have been granted since the invention is a mere 
re-arrangement of known elements. In the considered view of 
this court, such a contention cannot be accepted on a mere 
averment by the Defendant. The Defendant will have to place 
on record some scientific literature supported by some 
credible expert opinion to show even prima facie that the 
Defendant's product is a mere re-arrangement of already 
known products. This burden has not been discharged by the 
Defendant."

10.3 Strix 11 has been followed, by this Court, in various decisions, 

including Sandeep Jaidka v. Mukesh Mittal 12 , Telefonaktiebolaget 

LM Ericsson v. Intex Technologies 13 , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. 

J.D. Joshi 14 and Telefonktiebolaget LM Ericsson v. Lava 

International Ltd 15 . 

10.4 Thus, the challenge, posed by the defendant to the validity of 

the plaintiff's patent need not be such as to demonstrate, conclusively, 

the invalidity thereof. It is sufficient if the defendant is able to make 

out a case of the suit patent being vulnerable to revocation under the 

Patents Act. This vulnerability has, however, to be demonstrated by 

way of a credible challenge. The onus would be on the defendant, 

therefore, to establish the credibility of the challenge raised by it. The 

challenge cannot be incredible, fanciful, or moonshine. It must not 

strain the sinews of acceptability. There can, however, needless to 

say, be no fixed standard on the basis of which the credibility of the 

challenge can be assessed. It would be for the Court, in each case, 

therefore, to ascertain, for itself, whether the challenge raised by the 

defendant, to the validity of the suit patent, is, or is not, credible. 

10.5 I cannot understand Strix 11 as, however, in every case, requiring 

the defendant to provide expert evidence to support its credible 

challenge. The observation, in the said decision, that the defendant, in 

that case, had not produced any expert evidence to demonstrate the 

12 (2014) 211 DLT 401 
13 2015 (62) PTC 90 (Del) 
14 2015 (64) PTC 135 (Del) 
15 2016 (67) PTC 596 (Del) 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 24 of 174 

similarity between the invention patented by the European patent and 

the invention claimed in the suit patent has, necessarily, to be 

understood in the context of the facts before this Court. As the 

distinction between the subject matter of the European patent and the 

subject matter of the suit patent was found to essentially relate to the 

technical characteristics of the invention, this Court opined that, in the 

absence of any technical expert evidence produced by the defendant, 

it could not be said that the defendant had discharged the onus, cast on 

it, to show that the suit patent was vulnerable to challenge. It would, 

however, be perfectly open to the defendant, in a given case, to make 

out a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit patent on the 

basis of other material, without having to necessarily take recourse to 

expert evidence. While, therefore, being unable to agree with Mr. 

Sethi that, no expert evidence having been produced by the defendant 

in the present case, it could not be said that the defendant had not 

raised a credible challenge, it still remains to be assessed whether, in 

fact, a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit patent IN'307, 

in the present case, has been raised by the defendant, on the grounds 

urged by it. 

11. Disclosure vis-à-vis invalidity on the ground of obviousness 

11.1 Mr. Sai Deepak advances, principally, three contentions to 

support his submission that CTPR was disclosed by the genus patent, 

i.e., Claim 22 in IN'978. These are: 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 25 of 174 

(i) 
that Section 11(2)(b) 16 of the Patents Act creates a 

presumption of the existence of a disclosure in a patent to 

which the priority date has been assigned, 

(ii) that the plaintiff had admitted, in the plaint, "coverage" 

of CTPR by the genus patent, and the Supreme Court, in 

Novartis AG v. U.O.I. 17 , has clearly held that there can be no 

dichotomy, or distinction, between "coverage" and "disclosure" 

in a patent; ergo, acknowledgement of coverage amounts to an 

acknowledgement of disclosure, and 

(iii) that, in fact, the preferred embodiments, forming part of 

the Complete Specification of Claim 22 in IN'978, when 

applied to the Markush structure claimed therein, "led to 

CTPR". 

11.2 Apropos contention (iii), Claim 22 of IN'978 is reproduced as 

under: 

"A compound of Formula 1, its N-oxides and agriculturally 
suitable salts 

16 "11. Priority dates of claims of a complete specification -

(1) 
There shall be a priority date for each claim of the complete specification. 
(2) 
Where a complete specification is filed in pursuance of a single application 
accompanied by -
***** 
(b) 
a specification which is treated by virtue of a direction under sub-
section (3) of section 9 as a provisional specification, and the claim is fairly 
based on the matter disclosed in the specification referred to in clause (a) or 
clause (b), the priority date of that claim shall be the date of the filing of the 
relevant specification."

been emphasized by the defendant to denote the substitutions effected, 

by it, on the Markush moiety of Claim 22, which, according to the 

defendant, would "lead" a person skilled in the art to CTPR.) 

11.3 Para 102 of the written submission seeks to demonstrate how 

CTPR is "included within the scope" of Claim 22 of IN'978, thus: 

"102. It is submitted that the carrying out of the substitutions 
highlighted above show that the compound of Formula I 
includes within its scope Chlorantraniliprole when 

A and B are O 

R 1 is H 

R 2 is H 

R 3 is C1-C6 alkyl (in this case CH3 which is Cl alkyl, 
represented by NH -in Formula I) 

R 4 is independently C1-C6 alkyl (in this case CH3 which is Cl 
alkyl) or halogen (in this case chlorine i.e. Cl), with the 
substitutions being at the 5 and 3 positions respectively 

and n is 1 to 4 (in this case 2 which falls in the range of "1 to 
4") 

and J is independently a 5-or 6-membered heteroaromatic 
ring optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R 7 

where each R 7 is independently halogen (in this case Bromine 
i.e. Br) or each R 7 is independently 6-membered 
heteroaromatic ring, each ring optionally substituted with one

to three substituents independently selected from the group 
consisting halogen (Chlorine in this case). 

leads directly to the structure of Chlorantraniliprole." 

(Italics contained in the written statement of the defendant; 
underscoring supplied) 

11.4 Further, Mr. Sai Deepak has attempted to demonstrate that the 

Markush formula in Claim 22 of IN'978 sufficiently discloses CTPR, 

so as to enable a person skilled in the art to synthesise the latter from 

the former. This has been sought to be explained, in a tabular format, 

in para 103 of the written statement, thus: 

"It is further submitted that apart from a direct anticipation by 

prior claiming of Chlorantraniliprole, the broad Markush 
structure given in IN'307 in Claim 1 is also covered and 
encompassed wholly by the disclosure of Claim 22 of IN'978. 
The two claims are reproduced in the Table below with the 
relevant portions highlighted by the use of underlined and 
bold characters.

11.5 Mr. Sethi submits, per contra, that neither can the Markush 

structure claimed in Claim 1 in IN'307, nor can CTPR itself, be said 

to be disclosed in Claim 22 in IN'978. He submits that a person 

skilled in the art would not be able to arrive at CTPR from the 

embodiments or suggestions provided in Claim 22 in IN'978, without 

cherry picking selective radicals for substitution in the Markush 

moiety disclosed in the said Claim. This, he submits, is precisely 

what the defendant has done, in arriving at CTPR from the disclosure 

in Claim 22 in IN'978. In examining whether the genus patent taught, 

or disclosed the specie patent, Mr. Sethi submits that the approach has 

to be one of a person ordinarily skilled in the art. Such a person was 

required to be non-inventive and incapable of creative inputs. For this 

purpose, Mr. Sethi cites General Tire & Rubber Co. v. Firestone 

Tyre & Rubber Co. 18 , Eli Lilly v. Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals 19 

and Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam 10 . 

11.6 Claim 22 in IN'978, submits Mr. Sethi, is a Markush claim 

covering millions of compounds. Such a Markush claim does not, in 

any manner, disentitle patenting of any select compound, not 

disclosed in the Markush claim, but within the coverage thereof. This, 

he submits, is the entire concept of genus and specie patents, for 

which statutory sanction is also to be found in Section 10(5) of the 

Patents Act 20 , which permits patenting of an inventive concept

covering a group of interlinked inventions. Patents, he submits, may 

legitimately be granted to selection inventions, derived from the vast 

number of compounds covered by the Markush coverage in the genus 

patent. No embodiment in IN'978, Mr. Sethi submits, teaches CTPR, 

and the defendant, too, has not referred to any specific embodiment or 

embodiments in that regard. For this proposition, Mr. Sethi relies on 

the decision of the Chancery Division of the High Court of UK in In 

re. I. G. Farbenindustrie A.G.'s Patents 21 . For the proposition that 

individual specie patents may be granted to compounds which fall 

within the coverage of the genus patent, Mr. Sethi cites the judgment, 

dated 8 th December, 2015 of the Division Bench of this Court in F. 

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd 22 , the judgments of Single 

Benches of this Court in Eisai Co. Ltd v. Satish Reddy 23 and Bristol

11.7 Novartis 17 , submits Mr. Sethi, has no application for a variety 

of reasons. Firstly, Novartis 17 deals with the issue of patentability of 

the invention claimed by Novartis AG, the appellant before the 

Supreme Court, in the light of Section 3(d) 28 of the Patents Act. In a 

case where the Court is approached on the issue of patentability, by 

the applicant-plaintiff whose application for patent has been refused, 

the onus to establish patentability, points out Mr. Sethi, is on the 

aggrieved applicant-plaintiff. 
As against this, in case of an 

infringement challenge, where the defendant pleads vulnerability of 

the granted patent, the onus is on the defendant to show that the patent 

is vulnerable to challenge. Secondly, the Supreme Court proceeded, 

in that case, on its initial finding that the genus patent constituted prior 

art, whereas, in the present case, IN'978 does not, in his submission, 

constitute prior art for Claim 1 in IN'307 or for CTPR. Thirdly, the 

Supreme Court found that there was, in the genus patent, clear 

disclosure of the salt constituting the specie patent, within the claim of 

the genus patent, as the genus patent included "Imatinib and its 

pharmaceutically acceptable salts", and Imatinib Mesylate, the β-

crystalline form of which was the subject matter of dispute, was a 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib. Fourthly, Mr. Sethi 

28 "3. 
What are not inventions -
The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act, -
***** 
(d) 
the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result 
in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery of any 
new property or new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process, 
machine or apparatus unless such known process results in a new product or employs at 
least one new reactant. 
Explanation. -For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, 
metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, 
combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the 
same substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy;" 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 42 of 174 

submits that, while Novartis 17 was a decision essentially predicated on 

Section 3(d), that provision does not come in for consideration at all, 

in the present case, as CTPR, according to the plaintiff, is neither 

claimed nor disclosed in IN'978. Arguendo and without prejudice, 

Mr. Sethi submits that Novartis 17 did not hold, as Mr. Sai Deepak 

would seek to contend, that there was no distinction between coverage 

and disclosure. All it held was that no "wide gap" could be said to 

exist, between these two concepts in Indian patent law. Nor, submits 

Mr. Sethi, has the Supreme Court ultimately held, in Novartis 17 , that 

the specie patent could not be granted. For all these reasons, 

according to Mr. Sethi, the decision in Novartis 17 cannot advance the 

case of the defendant. 

11.8 I proceed, now, to address the three grounds raised by Mr. Sai 

Deepak, on the basis of which it is sought to be contended that CTPR 

was disclosed in Claim 22 in IN'978. While doing so, it has to be 

borne in mind that the plaintiff is not asserting that there is no 

disclosure in Claim 22 of IN'978. The contention of the plaintiff is 

that what is disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN'978, is the Markush structure 

visualised therein, and not CTPR or any moiety on which, by effecting 

substitutions in keeping with the embodiments provided in the said 

Claim, a person skilled in the art would be taught how to arrive at 

CTPR. 

11.9 Viewed thus, Section 11(2)(b) cannot support the conclusion 

that Mr. Sai Deepak would seek to draw from it. The defendant has, 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 43 of 174 

in its written submissions, specifically pointed out that it is not 

contesting the patentability of a Markush structure or Markush 

formula, as the Indian Patent Office accepts such applications. The 

specific submission, in this regard, as it figures in para-28 of the 

written submissions dated 29 th November, 2020, filed by the 

defendant, reads thus: 

"As regards Markush claims, it is clarified that the Defendant 
herein has no objection per se Markush type claims since they 
are accepted by the Indian Patent Office. The Defendant's 
limited argument is that if a Markush claim in an Indian 
patent or Patent Application with an earlier priority date 
subsumes within its ambit the specific claim or even a 
Markush claim of a subsequently filed patent application, then 
the former anticipates the latter within the meaning of Section 
13(1)(b)." 

In advancing such an argument, the defendant is, in my view, 

attempting to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. Once the 

defendant accepts that Markush claims are patentable, it no longer 

remains open to the defendant to rely on Section 11(2)(b) to advance 

an argument that, as Claim 22 in IN'978 was patented, there must be a 

presumption of disclosure of CTPR therein. The plaintiff's assertion, 

per contra, is that Claim 22 in IN'978 claimed a Markush structure, 

which does not claim, teach or disclose CTPR, or the Markush 

structure claimed in Claim 1 of IN'307, even if CTPR may come 

within the coverage of Claim 22 in IN'978. Section 11(2)(b) cannot, 

therefore, advance the case of the defendant. 

11.10 Mr. Sai Deepak's second contention, on facts, is that CTPR 

stands taught by the Markush structure in Claim 22 of IN'978, as, 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 44 of 174 

effecting substitutions in accordance with the embodiments provided 

in the said Claim itself, it is possible for a person skilled in the art to 

synthesise CTPR, as well as the Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 

of IN'307. A bare reading of para 102 of the written statement filed 

by the defendant, juxtaposed with para 101 thereof, clearly reveals the 

fallacy of this argument. The defendant has, in arriving at CTPR from 

the Markush structure claimed in Claim 22 of IN'978, clearly cherry 

picked, in para 102, specific substitutions out of the multifarious 

options provided in Claim 22 of IN'978, for each variable radical. 

The various substitutions effected on the Markush structure claimed in 

Claim 22 of IN'978 by the defendant, in order to arrive at CTPR, may 

be depicted thus: 

The above structure, when seen in juxtaposition with the explanation 

provided by the defendant in paras 101 and 102 of the written 

statement, reveals that, on the Markush structure provided in Claim 22 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019

ring with two substitutions at places 2 and 4, one being a 

halogen (Br) and the second a 6-membered aromatic ring with 

one halogen substitution (Cl). 

11.11 At a bare glance, it is apparent that the defendant has cherry 

picked the substitutions at 'A', 'B', 'R 1 ', 'R 2 ', 'R 3 ', 'J' and 'R 7 ', as 

well as the radicals for substitutions at the various places on the 5-


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 55 of 174 

membered or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings, out of the 

multifarious choices provided in Claim 22 in IN'978, so as to arrive at 

CTPR, or the Markush structure in Claim 1 in IN'307. No 

explanation for selecting these particular substitutions, out of the 

several substitutions provided in the Markush claim in IN'978, is 

forthcoming in the pleadings. It is apparent that these substitutions 

have been carefully selected so as to arrive at the Markush structure 

claimed in Claim 1 in IN'307, or at CTPR. Perhaps unwittingly, the 

pleadings and the written statement as much as acknowledge this fact, 

by the repeated use of the words "in this case" while referring to the 

selected substitutions in para 102 (as underscored in para 102 of the 

written statement as extracted in para 11.3 supra). The use of the 

words "in this case" amount to a tacit acknowledgement of the fact 

that the substitutions were selected so as to suit "this case", i.e. so as 

to arrive at CTPR. Prima facie, a person skilled in the art would not 

selectively choose the substitutions unless she, or he, is aware of the 

fact that, ultimately, CTPR is to be produced. No such effort having 

been made for all the years during which IN'978 remained valid, and 

the plaintiff being the first to synthesise CTPR from the Markush 

moiety claim then disclosed in Claim 22 in IN'978, it is not possible 

to accept the contention of the defendant that the embodiments 

provided in Claim 22 in IN'978 would "lead" a person skilled in the 

art to CTPR. No teaching, so as to enable such a person to synthesise 

CTPR can, therefore, be said, prima facie, to exist in the disclosure 

provided in Claim 22 in IN'978. It cannot, therefore, be said that 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 56 of 174 

Claim 22 in IN'978 teaches either the Markush structure in Claim 1 in 

IN'307 or, more particularly, CTPR. 

11.12 In Herbert Markman v. Westview 29 (which was followed, by 

the Division Bench of this Court in F. Hoffman La Roche 8 ), it has 

been held that any analysis of patent infringement entails two steps, 

the first being determination of the meaning and scope of the 

allegedly infringed patent claims and the second, comparison of the 

properly construed claim with the allegedly infringing device. In the 

present case, Mr. Sai Deepak would contend that Claim 1 of IN'307 

infringes Claim 22 of IN'978. There is no gainsaying that both are, in 

essence, Markush claims. CTPR is specifically exemplified in the 

specifications accompanying IN'307. There is, equally, no gainsaying 

that, by effecting substitutions on the Markush moiety as suggested in 

para 102 of the written statement filed by the defendant, it might be 

possible to arrive at the Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 of IN'307 

or even at CTPR. That, however, does not end the search. The 

question to be asked is -why would a person skilled in the art make 

the substitutions on the Markush moiety disclosed in Claim 22 of 

IN'978, out of the several substitutions envisaged in the said claim? 

Does IN'978 teach, or instruct, a person skilled in the art to effect 

these particular substitutions in order to achieve the results, or 

advantages, which CTPR provides? If the answer to this question is 

in the affirmative then, possibly, a case of infringement may exist, and 

Claim 1 in IN'307 might become vulnerable. If, however, the answer 

29 52 F. 3d. 967 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 57 of 174 

to this question is in the negative, then, the fact that, by effecting 

selected substitutions on the Markush moiety disclosed in Claim 22 of 

IN'978, the defendant has been able to arrive at the Markush moiety 

claimed in Claim 1 of IN'307, or even at CTPR, would not lead to an 

inference of infringement or even make out a case of vulnerability, of 

Claim 1 of IN'307, to revocation. 

11.13 No answer to this "why" poser is provided in the written 

statement filed by the defendant, or in the oral or written submissions 

of the defendant. I have, therefore, perused, with care, the complete 

specifications relating to IN'978 and, specifically, Claim 22 therein. I 

am unable to find, in the complete specifications, any "teaching" 

which would "lead" (to use the expression employed by the defendant 

in its written statement) a person skilled in the art to Claim 1 of 

IN'307 or, further, to CTPR. 

11.14 Reference to the principles enunciated in some judicial 

authorities is, in this context, apposite: 

11.14.1 
In para 50 of the report in Bishwanath Prasad Radhey 

Shyam 10 , the Supreme Court, while holding that the allegedly 

infringed invention was not novel, but was obvious even from the 

allegedly infringing invention, opined thus: 

"The patented machine is merely an application of an old 
invention, known for decades before 1951, for the traditional 
purpose of scraping and turning utensils, with a slight change 
in the mode of application, which is no more than a 
"workshop improvement", a normal development of an 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 58 of 174 

existing manner of manufacture not involving something 
novel which would be outside the probable capacity of a 
craftsman. The alleged discovery does not lie outside the 
track of what was known before. It would have been obvious 
to any skilled worker in the field, in the state of knowledge 
existing at the date of patent, of what was publicly known or 
practiced before about this process, that the claim in question 
viz., mere addition of a lever and bracket did not make the 
invention the subject of the claim concerned. There has been 
no substantial exercise of the inventive power or innovative 
faculty. There is no evidence that the patented machine is the 
result of any research, independent thought, ingenuity and 
skill." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

11.14.2 
In Eli Lilly 19 , the Court of Appeal was concerned with an 

allegation, levelled by Eli Lilly, of infringement, by the defendants 

before it (collectively referred to, hereinafter, as "Zenith") of its US 

Patent No 5229 382 (US 382). Zenith alleged US 382 to be invalid, as 

it was anticipated by an article entitled "4-Piperazinyl-10H-

thieno[2,3-b][1,5] benzodiazepines as Potential Neuroleptics", from 

the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry authored by Jiban K. Chakrabarti 

et al (cited, in the judgement of the Court of Appeals, as "Chakrabarti 

1980a"). The following passages, from the decision of the Court of 

Appeals, are instructive: 

"Anticipation is a question of fact, including whether 
or not an element is inherent in the prior art. See In re 
Schreiber, 128 F.3d 1473,1477 (Fed.Cir.1997). Therefore, 
this Court reviews a finding of anticipation under the clearly 
erroneous standard. Atlas Powder Co. v. Ireco, Inc., 190 F.3d 
1342,1346 (Fed.Cir.1999). To anticipate, of prior art 
reference must place the inventive compound or composition 
in the possession of the public. In re Brown, 51 C.C.P.A. 
1254, 329 F.2d 1006,1011 (1964). Thus, the prior art 
reference must disclose each and every feature of the claimed 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 59 of 174 

invention, either explicitly or inherently. Glaxo Inc. v. No-
vopharm Ltd., 52 F.3d 1043,1047 (Fed. Cir. 1995). 

Pointing to In re Petering 49 C.C..P.A. 993,301 F.2d 
676 (1962) and In re Schaumann, 572 F.2d 312 
(C.C.P.A.1987), IVAX asserts that Chakrabarti 1980a 
anticipated claim 1 of the '382 patent because it identified 
compounds from the same family of compounds 
(thienobenzodiazepines). Indeed, in Petering, the Board of 
Patent Appeals affirmed the examiner's rejection of claims 1, 
2, 4, 5, 7, and 10-12 of the patent applicant's application on 
"isoalloxazines." 301 F. 2d at 677. However, in contrast to 
this case, the prior art in Petering did more than make a 
broad generic disclosure. In Petering, the prior art disclosed 
a limited number of specific preferences from a specifically 
defined group of isoalloxazines. Id. As a result, Petering 
actually disclosed to one skilled in the art a limited class of 
only "some 20 compounds", including "6,7-dimethyl-9-
(Bmonohydroxyethyl)-isoalloxazine". Schaumann, 572 F.2d 
at 315 (citing Petering, 301 F.2d at 682). 

Similarly, the prior art in Schaumann disclosed 14 
compounds, later further narrowed to 7, considering express 
preferences. Additionally, the structural formula of this prior 
art contained but a single variable. 572 F. 2d at 314. Thus, 
in Schaumann, the prior art patent embraced a very limited 
number of closely related compounds and specifically 
described the claimed compound. 572 F. 2d at 316. Thus, 
unlike this case, the prior art in both Petering and 
Schaumann expressly spelled out a definite and limited class 
of compounds that enabled a person of ordinary skill in the 
art to act once envisage each member of this limited class. 
Schaumann, 572 F.2d at 315; Petering 301 F.2d at 681-82. 

By contrast, the number of compounds actually 
disclosed by Chakrabarti 1980a numbers in the millions 
(including 
all 
proposed 
alternative 
substituents). 
Chakrabarti 1980a examine forty five specific compounds 
(as opposed to a genus of compounds) in the 4-Piperazinyl-
10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepines family and fourteen 
analogous 
5-piperazinyl-substituted 
4H-thieno[2,3-
b][1,4]benzodiazepines, which were created to compare 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 60 of 174 

activity. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 364 F. 
Supp. 2d at 848. Indeed, Chakrabarti 1980a listed several 
preferred compounds and substituents, none of which 
resemble olanzapine: 

for 
R-a 
methyl, 
hydroxyethyl, 
or 
hydroxypropyl; 

for R1-a fluorine, chlorine, or 7, 8, difluoro [no 
hydrogen]: and 

for R2 -a methyl, 2-ethyl, or 2-isopropyl group. 

Id at 848. Five of the preferred individual compounds (9, 12, 
17, 29, and 34) are more potent than clozapine (scoring a 3 
CAR or higher) and having clozapine-like effect. For those 
five preferred compounds, the Chakrabarti 1980a authors 
expressed a preference for specific, complete compounds 
without any variation of the individual substituents on those 
molecules. Chakrabarti 1980a also always expressed a 
preference for halogen-containing compounds (fluorine or 
chlorine), not hydrogen. Id. At 832-33. Furthermore, 
compounds 9, 12, 17 and 29 all have fluorine at the 7-position 
of the benzene ring. And though Compound 34 does have 
hydrogen the 7-position of the benzene ring, it has a 
hydroxyethyl on its piperazine ring, unlike olanzapine. Id. In 
sum, Chakrabarti 1980a discloses nothing close to the 
claimed invention. 

Chakrabarti 1980a does provide a general structural formula 
with possible substituents of "R", "R1" and "R2", but it does 
not define at all. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 
364 F.Supp.2d at 900. No possible combination of those 
preferred substituents would lead to the components that 
make up olanzapine, because each would contain a fluorine or 
a chlorine. To make olanzapine from Chakrabarti 1980a, one 
would have to depart from the teaching of the article and 
recombine the components of the specific illustrative 
compounds with hindsight. Thus, Chakrabarti 1980a does not 
anticipate because: (1) the article prefers complete 
compounds, not individual substituents, (2) the article 
discloses no generic disclosure encompassing olanzapine or 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 61 of 174 

even stating that substituents on different compounds were 
interchangeable, and (3) the article does not suggest 
transforming unpreferred compounds 7 into a preferred 
compound. 
Thus, Chakrabarti 1980a did not place 
olanzapine in the possession of the public."

11.14.3 
Apotex 27 was a judgement of the Supreme Court of 

Canada, particularly dealing with the validity of selection patents. 

The respondent in that case ("Sanofi", in short) was the holder of a 

Canadian patent '875, which disclosed a genus or class of compounds 

useful in inhibiting platelet aggregation activity in the blood. Over 

250,000 possible different compounds, useful for this purpose, were 

disclosed by the '875 patent. One such compound was a racemate, 

which is a substance containing equal amounts of two structurally 

different compounds, called enantiomers or optical isomers, namely 

the dextro-rotatory and the levo-rotatory isomer. Sanofi's subsequent 

patent ("the 777 patent") disclosed and claimed clopidogrel 

bisulphate, an anti-coagulant which inhibited platelet aggregation 

activity in the blood. It was an admitted position that clopidogrel 

bisulphate was encompassed within the scope of the claims in the 

'875 patent and that clopidogrel was the dextro-rotatory isomer of the 

racemate, which added beneficial properties over both the racemate 

and its levorotatory isomer. Clopidogrel bisulphate was a salt of 

clopidogrel, which had a better therapeutic index than the salts of the 

racemic mixture. The advantage of clopidogrel bisulphate or, for that 

matter, even clopidogrel, over the racemate and the levorotatory 

isomer was, therefore, admitted. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 62 of 174 

11.14.3.1 Apotex served a notice on Sanofi, alleging that the 777 

patent was invalid on the ground of anticipation, obviousness and 

double patenting. Sanofi contended, per contra, that clopidogrel 

bisulphate was a selection patent, out of the moieties disclosed in the 

'875 patent. 

11.14.3.2 The Court first referred to the decision in 

Farbenindustrie 21 , terming it the locus classicus describing selection 

patents. On this, paras 9 and 10 of the judgment read thus: 

"9. 
The locus classicus describing selection patents is the 
decision of Maugham J. in In re. I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.'s 
Patents (1930), 47 R.P.C 289 (Ch. D.). At p. 321, he 
explained that in the field of chemical patents (which would 
of course include pharmaceutical compounds), there are often 
two "sharply divided classes". The first class of patents, 
which he called originating patents, are based on an 
originating invention, namely, the discovery of a new reaction 
or a new compound. The second class comprises patents 
based on a selection of compounds from those described in 
general terms and claimed in the originating patent. 
Maugham J. cautioned that the selected compounds cannot 
have been made before, or the selection patent "would fail for 
want of novelty". But if the selected compounds is "novel" 
and "possess[es] a special property of an unexpected 
character", the required "inventive" step would be satisfied 
(p. 321). At p. 322, Maugham J. stated that a selection patent 
"does not in its nature differ from any other patent". 

10. 
While not exhaustively defining a selection patent, he 
set out (at pp. 322-23) three conditions that must be satisfied 
for a selection patent to be valid. 

1. 
There must be a substantial advantage to be 
secured or disadvantage to be avoided by the use of the 
selected members. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 63 of 174 

2. 
The whole of the selected members (subject to 
"a few exceptions here and there") possess the 
advantage in question. 

3. 
The selection must be in respect of a quality of 
a special character peculiar to the selected group. If 
further research revealed a small number of unselected 
compounds possessing the same advantage, that would 
not invalidate the selection patent. However, if 
research showed that a large number of unselected 
compounds possess the same advantage, the quality of 
the compound claimed in the selection patent would 
not be of a special character." 

[Though the Patents Act does not specifically refer to "selection 

patents", so long as (a) the invention, as selected from the Markush 

moiety in the genus patent, fulfils the description of "invention", (b) 

involves, in its fabrication of creation, an "inventive step", within the 

meaning of clauses (i) and (ja) of Section 2, and (c) does not suffer 

from any of the disabilities envisaged by Section 64 of the Patents 

Act, it is, ex facie, patentable. There is no reason, therefore, why the 

criteria of the patentability, qua selection patents, enumerated in 

Farbenindustrie 21 , should not apply in this country as well.] The 

Court, thereafter, went on to quote the following test, for obviousness 

in a patent, from Beloit Canada Ltd v. Valmet Oy 30 : 

"The test for obviousness is not to ask what competent 
inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. 
Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone 
for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having 
no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of 
deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph 
of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be 

30 (1986) 8 CPR (3d) 289 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 64 of 174 

asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the 
Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the 
state of the art and common general knowledge as at the 
claimed date of invention, have come directly and without 
difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very 
difficult test to satisfy." 

In principle, I am inclined to agree with this test, to determine whether 

a patent discloses a particular invention or moiety which becomes, 

therefore, obvious from the patent. From the teachings in the genus 

patent, the person skilled in the art must be in a position to arrive, 

without unduly straining his imaginative and creative faculties, at the 

specie patent, in order for the specie patent to be invalidated on the 

ground of obviousness. The element of "directness" must be there. 

The choice which the person skilled in the art would make, by way of 

substitutions on the Markush moiety or otherwise, must be apparent 

from the teachings in the genus patent, in order for the specie patent to 

be treated as "obvious". A "trial and error" approach would be 

antithetical to any suggestion of "obviousness". 

11.14.3.3 Apotex 27 went on to discuss, in detail, the legal situation 

as it prevailed in Canada. It is not necessary to embark on that 

discussion here; however, the following discussion on the facts of that 

case, in paras 70, 72 and 73 of the opinion of the Court, apply, mutatis 

mutandis, to the case on hand: 

"[70] It is well known that the pharmaceutical industry is 
intensely competitive. Market participants are continuously in 
search of new and improved medications and want to reach 
the market with them as soon as possible. So demand for an 
effective and non-toxic product to inhibit platelet aggregation 
might be assumed to exist. However, nothing in the '875 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 65 of 174 

patent or common general knowledge provided a specific 
motivation for the skilled person to pursue the '777 invention. 
The prior patent was a genus patent, and selection might be 
expected. However, the prior patent did not differentiate 
between the efficacy and the toxicity of any of the compounds 
it covered. This suggests that what to select or omit was not 
then self-evident to the person skilled in the art. 

[72] The methods to obtain the invention of the '777 patent 
were common general knowledge. It can be assumed that 
there was a motive to find a non-toxic efficacious product to 
inhibit platelet aggregation in the blood. However, it was not 
self-evident from the '875 patent or common general 
knowledge what the properties of the dextro-rotatory isomer 
of this racemate would be or what the bisulfate salt's 
beneficial properties would be and therefore that what was 
being tried ought to work. The course of conduct and the time 
involved throughout demonstrate that the advantage of the 
dextro-rotatory isomer was not quickly or easily predictable. 
Had the dextro-rotatory isomer been "obvious to try", it is 
difficult to believe that Sanofi would not have opted for it 
before unnecessary time and investment were spent on the 
racemate. I conclude that the prior art and common general 
knowledge of persons skilled in the art at the relevant time 
were not sufficient for it to be more or less self-evident to try 
to find the dextro-rotatory isomer. 

[73] As I have earlier explained, there was a significant 
difference between the '875 genus patent and the '777 
selection patent. The difference was not obvious. Having 
regard to the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the allegation 
of obviousness is not justified." 

11.14.4 
Yet another decision, from overseas, which is instructive, 

is the judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in Dr Reddy's 

Laboratories 26 which again dealt with olanzapine. The classical 

explanation for why omnibus Markush claims could not be treated as 

obvious of individual moieties which might otherwise fall within the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 66 of 174 

generalised coverage of such claims was expressed, in the said 

decision, thus: 

"An old question and answer runs as a follows: "Where does 
a wise man hide a leaf? In a forest." It is, at least faintly, 
ridiculous to say that a particular leaf has been made available 
to you by telling you that it is in Sherwood Forest. Once 
identified, you can of course see it. But if not identified you 
know only the generality: that Sherwood Forest has millions 
of leaves. 

The contention has no logical stopping place. If there is 
disclosure of olanzapine here, why would one not regard an 
even more general disclosure as a disclosure of it. Suppose 
the prior art had merely been of "3-ringed organic 
compounds?" Such a description would encompass much 
much bigger numbers than the 1019 of formula I. Yet the 
logic of the argument would be the same -that there is a 
disclosure of each and every member of the class. 

I would add that I would regard the listing out of a great 
number of compounds as opposed to the use of a Markush 
formula in the same way. To say a particular book is 
identified by saying "the books in the Bodleian" is no 
different from saying it is identified by providing access to 
the catalogue of the Bodleian. 

Similarly it makes no sense to say that a generalised prior 
description discloses a specific matter falling within in (sic). 
The judge's example illustrates the point. A prior disclosure 
of "fixing means" is not a disclosure of a particular fixing 
means e.g. welding or riveting even though you could list out 
a whole number of ways of fixing things together which 
would include these means. 

Thus logic dictates rejection of the argument that a disclosure 
of a large class is a disclosure of each and every member of 
it." 

These paragraphs, in the opinion of this Court, condense, in 

themselves, the very essence of the concepts of disclosure and 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 67 of 174 

obviousness, even within the parameters of the Patents Act in this 

country. 

11.15 Novartis 17 , deconstructed: 

11.15.1 
Intrinsically interlinked with the principle of disclosure is 

the judgement of the Supreme Court in Novartis 17 . As this judgement 

constitutes the only authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme 

Court on pharmaceutical patents, it deserves to be examined in detail. 

11.15.2 
Jurg Zimmerman invented several derivatives of N-

phenyl-2-pyrimidine-amine, which could inhibit certain protein 

kinases and could, therefore, be used to treat tumours. Zimmerman 

applied to the US patent office, for patenting of these derivatives one 

of which was Imatinib) on 28 th April, 1994. The derivatives were 

granted US Patent No. 5521184 ("US 184", in short) on 28 th May, 

1996. US 184 has, in the judgement, been referred to as the 

"Zimmerman patent". 

11.15.3 
Novartis AG ("Novartis" hereinafter) applied, to the 

Chennai Patent Office, on 17 th July, 1998, for grant of patent for the β-

crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, which was a salt of Imatinib, 

claimed to have been invented by Novartis. Novartis claimed to have 

synthesized the β-crystalline form from the free base Imatinib in two 

steps; by first producing the methanesulphonic acid salt of Imatinib 

and, thereafter, proceeding to develop the β-crystalline form thereof. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 68 of 174 

11.15.4 
In the application, Novartis claimed that the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate was superior to the α-crystalline form of 

Imatinib Mesylate as it had more beneficial flow properties, better 

thermodynamic stability and lower hygroscopicity. The patent 

application of Novartis did not, however, claim any superiority, of the 

β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, over the Imatinib freebase. 

Rather, it was admitted, in the patent application, that "all indicated 

inhibitory and pharmacological effects" of the β-crystalline form of 

Imatinib Mesylate were "also found with the freebase". Subsequent 

to amendment of the Patents Act, however, Novartis filed four 

affidavits of experts, in which it was claimed that the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate had "much higher bioavailability", as 

compared to the freebase Imatinib. 

11.15.5 
In its patent application, Novartis cited 18 th July, 1997 as 

the "priority date" 31 of the patent, being the date on which Novartis 

31 "Priority date" is defined, in Section 2(w), as having "the meaning assigned to it by Section 11. Section 11 

reads thus: 
"11. 
Priority date of claims of a complete specification -
(1) 
There shall be a priority date for each claim of a complete specification. 
(2) 
Where the complete specifications filed in pursuance of a single application 
accompanied by -
(a) 
a provisional specification; or 
(b) 
a specification which is treated by virtue of a direction under sub-
section (3) of section 9 has a provisional specification, and the claim is fairly 
based on the matter disclosed in the specification referred to in clause (a) or 
clause (b), the priority date of that claim shall be the date of the filing of the 
relevant specification. 
(3) 
Where the complete specifications filed or proceeded with in pursuance of two 
or more applications accompanied by such specifications as mentioned in sub-section (2) 
and the claim is fairly based on the matter disclosed -
(a) 
in any of those specifications, the priority date of that claim shall be 
the date of filing of the application accompanied by that specification; 
(b) 
partly in one and partly in another, the priority date of that claim shall 
be the date of the filing of the application accompanied by the specification of 
the later date.

had applied for grant of patent of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate in Switzerland. 

11.15.6 
The Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs, vide file 

order dated 25 th January, 2006, rejected the application, of Novartis, 

for grant of patent for the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. 

The reasons cited for rejecting the application were that (i) the 

Zimmerman Patent anticipated the invention claimed by Novartis, i.e. 

the β-crystalline form of imatinib Mesylate, by prior publication, (ii) 

the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was obvious to a person 

skilled in the art, in view of the disclosure contained in the complete 

specifications of the Zimmerman Patent, (iii) the β-crystalline form of 

Imatinib Mesylate could not be patented in view of Section 3(d) of the 

Patents Act and (iv) Novartis had wrongly claimed the Swiss priority 

(3A)* 
Where the complete specification based on a previously filed application in 
India has been filed within twelve months of the date of the application and the claim is 
fairly based on the matter disclosed in the previously filed application, the priority date of 
that claim shall be the date of the previously filed application in which the matter was 
first disclosed. 
(4) 
Where the complete specification has been filed in pursuance of a further 
application made by virtue of sub-section (1) of section 16 and the claim is fairly based 
on the matter disclosed in any of the earlier specifications, provisional or complete, as the 
case may be, the priority date of that claim shall be the date of the filing of that 
specification in which the matter was first disclosed. 
(5) 
Where, under the foregoing provisions of this section, any claim of a complete 
specification would, but for the provisions of that sub-section, have two or more priority 
dates, the priority date of that claim shall be the earlier or earliest of those dates. 
(6) 
In any case to which sub-sections (2), (3), (3A)*, (4) and (5) do not apply, the 
priority date of a claim shall, subject to the provisions of section 137, be the date of filing 
of the complete specification. 
(7) 
The reference to the date of the filing of the application or of the complete 
specification in this section shall, in cases where there has been a post-dating under 
section 9 of section 17 or, as the case may be, an ante-dating under section 16, be a 
reference to the date as so post-dated or ante-dated. 
(8) 
A claim in a complete specification of a patent shall not be invalid by reason 
only of -
(a) 
the publication or use of the invention so far as claimed in that claim 
on or after the priority date of that claim; or 
(b) 
the grant of another patient which claims the invention so far as 
claimed in the first mentioned claim, in a claim of the same or a later priority 
date." 
*Sub-section (3A) was inserted by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, w.e.f. 1st January, 2005. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 70 of 174 

date as the priority date for filing of its patent application. Novartis 

challenged the order of the Assistant Controller by way of writ 

petitions filed before the High Court of Madras, which were 

transferred to the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) and 

registered as appeals. 

11.15.7 
The IPAB dismissed the appeals vide judgement dated 

26 th June, 2009. Even while holding that (i) the product sought to be 

patented by Novartis, i.e. the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, 

satisfied the tests of novelty and non-obviousness and (ii) Novartis 

was entitled to claim 18 th July, 1997 as the priority date (for which 

purpose the IPAB relied on Section 133), the IPAB held that the 

product was, nonetheless, not patentable in view of Section 3(d) of the 

Patents Act which, according to the IPAB, set a "requirement of 

higher standard of inventive step in the law particularly for 

drug/pharmaceutical substances". The IPAB held, however, that 

Novartis was entitled to patent in respect of the process for 

manufacture of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. 

11.15.8 
Novartis directly approached the Supreme Court, 

challenging the aforesaid order of the IPAB. While criticising 

Novartis for having bypassed the available remedy before the High 

Court, the Supreme Court, in view of the importance and intricacy of 

the issue involved, agreed, by consent, to decide the appeal on merits. 

Thus came to be passed the judgement under discussion. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 71 of 174 

11.15.9 
The Supreme Court observed, initially, that Section 5, 

which permitted patenting only of inventions for methods or process 

of manufacture and, therefore, prohibited grant of patent to substances 

intended for use, or capable of being used, as food or medicine or 

drug or prepared or produced by chemical processes, was deleted, 

w.e.f. 1 st January, 2005, by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 ("the 

2005 Amendment Act", hereinafter). The Supreme Court proceeded, 

thereafter, from paras 29 to 72 of the report, to trace the entire history 

of the Patents Act, as well as the various amendments thereto, from 

time to time. Thereafter, the Supreme Court proceeded to extract 

clauses (ac), (j) and (ja) of Section 2 32 and delineate, in para 74, the 

three conditions, cumulatively required to be satisfied in order for a 

product to qualify as an "invention", thus: 

"Section 2(1)(j) requires a product to satisfy three conditions 
to qualify as an invention: 
(i) 
It must be "new", that is to say it must not have 
been anticipated; 
(ii) 
Its coming into being must involve an 
"inventive step"; and 
(iii) It must be "capable of industrial application", 
that is to say it must be capable of being made or used 
in an industry [Section 2(1)(ac)]." 
(Emphasis in original) 

32 "2. 
Definitions and interpretation -
(1) 
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, -
***** 
(ac) 
"capable of industrial application", in relation to any invention, means that the 
invention is capable of being made or used in an industry; 
***** 
(j) 
"invention" means a new product or process involving an inventive step and 
capable of industrial application; 
(ja) 
"inventive step" means a feature of an invention that involves technical advance 
as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance of both and that 
makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art;" 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 72 of 174 

Thus was introduced, into the concept of "invention", as defined in 

the Patents Act, the principle of "anticipation", as antithetical to 

"newness" -or, more properly, "novelty". Clearly, the Supreme 

Court holds that an invention which was "anticipated" cannot be 

regarded as "novel". Para 75 went on to paraphrase clause (ja) by 

holding that "the invention that creates the product must have a 

feature that involves technical advance as compared to the existing 

knowledge or having economic significance or both and this feature 

should be such as to make the invention not obvious to a person 

skilled in the art". Para 76 went on to crystallise these observations 

by delineating the characteristics of an "invention", for the purposes 

of the Patents Act, thus: 

"On a combined reading of clauses (j), (ac) and (ja) of 
Section 2(1), in order to qualify as "invention", a product 
must, therefore, satisfy the following tests: 

(i) 
It must be "new"; 

(ii) 
It must be "capable of being made or used in an 
industry"; 

(iii) It must come into being as a result of an 
invention which has a feature that: 

(a) entails technical advance over existing 
knowledge; 
or 

(b) 
has an economic significance; 

and 

(c) 
makes the invention not obvious to a 
person skilled in the art." 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 73 of 174 

11.15.10 
For being entitled to grant of a patent, however, the 

Supreme Court held that the product was required not only to satisfy 

the tests entitling it to be regarded as an "invention", but was also 

required to be "patentable". Section 3 of the Patents Act, it was 

observed, demarcated two situations in which the right to patent could 

be lawfully denied; firstly, where the product was not an "invention", 

such as in the case of clauses (b) and (e) 33 , and, secondly, where, 

though the product was an "invention", other considerations 

prohibited grant of patent, such as in the case of clause (d) 28 . The 

Supreme Court held, however, that it was concerned only with clause 

(d). 

11.15.11 
Apropos Section 3(d), the Supreme Court rejected the 

contention, advanced before it, that the provision had been introduced 

ex majore cautela. Section 3(d), it was held, underscored the 

distinction between the concepts of invention and patentability, and 

was amended, by the 2005 Amendment Act, especially to deal with 

chemical substances, and more particularly with pharmaceutical 

products. As amended, it was observed that Section 3(d) set up a 

second 
tier 
of 
qualifying 
standards 
for 
chemical 

33 "3. 
What are not inventions -
The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act, -
***** 
(b) 
an invention the primary or intended use or commercial exploitation of which could be 
contrary to public order or morality, or which causes serious prejudice to human, animal or plant 
life or health or the environment; 
***** 
(e) 
a substance obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the application of the 
properties of the components thereof or a process for producing such substance;" 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 74 of 174 

substances/pharmaceutical products, which would, while enabling 

patenting of true and genuine inventions, "check any attempt at 

repetitive patenting or extension of the patent term on spurious 

grounds" (in para 87 of the report). The importance of section 3(d), in 

a case where a plea of repetitive patenting, or extension of a patent 

beyond its expiry, was set up by the defendant cannot, therefore, be 

gainsaid. Para 88 of the report went on to observe that, read in 

conjunction, clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1), and Section 3(d), "set 

different standards for qualifying as "invention" things belonging to 

different classes, and for medicinal and other chemical substances, the 

Act sets the invention threshold further higher, by virtue of the 

amendments made in Section 3(d) in the year 2005". 

11.15.12 
Plainly, the sequitur of this observation would be that, in 

the case of pharmaceutical substances, the product, in order to be 

"patentable", would not only have to qualify as an "invention", and as 

the result of an "inventive step", but would also have to satisfy the 

rigour of Section 3(d). Of course, this would be relevant only where, 

on facts, Section 3(d) would apply, i.e. where there was an earlier 

"known substance", and the product/process being sought to be 

patented was either 

(i) 
a new form of the known substance, in which case the 

product was required to possess "enhanced efficacy", as 

compared to the "known efficacy" of the "known substance", 

or 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 75 of 174 

(ii) a "mere discovery of any new property or a new use" for 

the known substance, or "the mere use of a known process, 

machine or apparatus", in which case the known process had to 

either 

(a) result in a new product or 

(b) employ at least one new reactant, or 

(iii) a salt, ester, ether, polymorph, metabolite, pure form, 

particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complex, 

combination or other derivative of the known substance, which, 

then, would be considered to be the same substance, and in 

which case the product would have to differ, significantly, in 

efficacy. 

11.15.13 
The precise claim of Novartis was, thereafter, thus set out 

by the Supreme Court in its judgement: 

(i) 
Example 21 of the Zimmerman Patent specifically 

claimed Imatinib. 

(ii) Novartis contended that formulation of the following two 

inventions were involved in the production of the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate, from the freebase Imatinib: 

(a) The first invention, in the process of conversion of 

Imatinib to the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, 

was Imatinib Mesylate itself. For this, Example 21 had 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 76 of 174 

to be selected out of the 37 examples specified in the 

Zimmerman Patent and methanesulphonic acid had to be 

chosen, to produce Imatinib Mesylate. It was contended, 

by Novartis, that neither of these steps was either 

"taught" or suggested, by Example 21 of the Zimmerman 

Patent, to a person skilled in the art. In producing 

Imatinib Mesylate from Imatinib, therefore, it was 

contended that technical advance was involved, as 

compared to the existing knowledge, and the new 

substance had come into being. 

(b) The second invention was the invention which 

Novartis desired to patent, namely the β-crystalline form 

of Imatinib Mesylate. The necessity of this invention, 

contended Novartis, was to ensure that Imatinib Mesylate 

was suitable for administration in solid oral dosage form. 

The process parameters, resulting in the creation of the β-

crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, were also required 

to be defined. Novartis pointed out that the Zimmerman 

Patent made no reference to polymorphism or to any 

crystalline structure. The crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate was, therefore, it was contended, a distinct, and 

further, invention, beyond Imatinib Mesylate itself. 

While thus synthesising the β-crystalline form of 

Imatinib Mesylate, suitability of administration to human 

beings was also required to be ensured. Comparing the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 77 of 174 

characteristics of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate with the freebase Imatinib, Novartis submitted 

that the Zimmerman Patent described, at best, (i) how to 

prepare the freebase Imatinib and (ii) the anti-tumour 

properties of the freebase Imatinib. Both the steps 

involved in proceeding from the freebase Imatinib to the 

β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, therefore, it was 

submitted, resulted in distinct inventions. 

11.15.14 
Examination of the correctness of these contentions, 

noted the Supreme Court, would involve detailed analysis of the 

Zimmerman Patent and the developments that took place thereafter, 

especially with respect to Novartis. These developments were set out 

thus (in paras 93 to 93.11 of the report): 

(i) 
The application for grant of the Zimmerman Patent was 

filed, by M/s Ciba Geigy, in the US, on 28 th April, 1994. (An 

earlier application filed on 2 nd April, 1993 was abandoned.) 

The invention declared by the application related to N-phenyl-

2-pyrimidine-amine derivatives which, in the application, were 

parenthesized as "Formula I", as well as their compounds, their 

process of preparation and therapeutic uses. The application 

specifically stated that the compounds in Formula I included 

their respective salts, by expressly stipulating that "any 

reference to the free compounds should be understood as 

including the corresponding salts, where appropriate and 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 78 of 174 

expedient". It was further declared that the compounds of 

Formula I had valuable pharmacological properties and could 

be used as, inter alia, anti-tumour drugs, by "(inhibiting) the 

tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor for the epidermal growth 

factor". By this mechanism, the application declared that the 

compounds of Formula I were able to prevent metastizing of 

tumours, and to achieve regression thereof. Example 21 in the 

application admittedly related to Imatinib, with the chemical 

formula N -{5 -[4 -[(4 -methyl -piperazinomethyl) -

benzoylamido] -2 -methylphenyl} -4 -(3 -pyridyl) -2 -

pyrimidine amine. It was further provided, under S. No. 23 

towards the end of the application, thus: 

"The compounds according to claim 1 of the formula I, 
said 
compound 
being 
N-{5-[4-[(4-methyl-
piperazinomethyl)-benzoylamido]-2-methylphenyl}-4 
(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof." 
(Emphasis provided in the judgement) 

(ii) The Zimmerman Patent (US 184) was granted on 28 th 

May, 1996. 

(iii) Prior to launching of a new drug, laws in the US require 

the intending manufacturer to file a New Drug Application 

(NDA), initially at an investigative stage. On 9 th April, 1998, 

Novartis filed the investigational NDA for Gleevec, the name 

under which it was proposing to manufacture and market 

Imatinib Mesylate, with the Food and Drug Administration 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 79 of 174 

(FDA), US. The original NDA, for Imatinib Mesylate, for 

treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, was filed 

by Novartis with the FDA, on 27 th February, 2001. US laws 

also required declaration of the patent information, relating to 

the new drug, while filing the NDA. Novartis, in the patent 

information furnished in connection with the NDA for Imatinib 

Mesylate, declared Imatinib Mesylate as the active ingredient 

and, further, declared that the active ingredient, the drug 

product (composition/formulation) and method of use were 

covered by the Zimmerman Patent (US 184). 

(iv) Approval for Gleevec (Imatinib Mesylate), in the form of 

50 mg and 100 mg capsules, was granted, by the FDA, vide 

letter dated 10 th May, 2001. Following this, Novartis launched 

Gleevec, commercially, in the market. This was much before 

any application was filed, by it, for patenting the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate. The description of the drug, on the 

package insert of Gleevec capsules, as marketed by Novartis, 

declared as under: 

"GLEEVEC TM capsules contain Imatinib Mesylate 
equivalent to 100 mg of Imatinib freebase. Imatinib 
Mesylate is designed chemically as 4 -[(4 -Methyl -1 
-piperazinyl) methyl] -N -[4 -methyl -3 -[[4 -(3 -
pyridinyl) -2 -pyrimidinyl] amino] -phenyl] 
benzamide methanesulfonate …" 

(v) On 3 rd July, 2001, Novartis applied for a patent term 

extension for the Zimmerman Patent (US 184), for extending 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 80 of 174 

the term of the Zimmerman Patent for the time taken in the 

regulatory review for Gleevec. This, observes the Supreme 

Court (in para 101 of the report), "leaves no room for doubt that 

Imatinib Mesylate, marketed under the name Gleevec, was 

submitted for grant approval as covered by the Zimmerman 

Patent". This was underscored by the fact that, even in the 

patent application, Novartis declared that the sole active 

ingredient in Gleevec was Imatinib Mesylate. In so far as the 

manner in which Imatinib Mesylate was claimed in the 

Zimmerman Patent, the patent term extension application 

declared thus: 

"Statement showing how the claims of the patent for 
which extension is sought cover the approved product: 

The operative claims in question are Claims 1-5, 10-13 
and 21-23. Each of Claims 1-5, 10-13 and 23 claim a 
compound or compounds which include the approved 
product, Imatinib Mesylate. Claim 21 claims of 
composition containing a compound or compounds 
which include the approved product, Imatinib 
Mesylate. Claim 22 claims a method for treating 
tumours in warm-blooded animals with a compound or 
compounds which include the approved product, 
Imatinib Mesylate." 

The application was accepted and the term of the Zimmerman 

Patent (US 184), otherwise due to expire on 28 th May, 2013, 

was extended for 586 days. 

(vi) Novartis had applied, in the US, for grant of patent for 

the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. The examiner 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 81 of 174 

rejected the application, against which Novartis appealed to the 

Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ("the Board of 

Patent Appeals", in short). The Board of Patent Appeals 

reversed the decision of the examiner. It was held, by the 

Board of Patent Appeals, that, though the Zimmerman Patent 

did teach any person skilled in the art how to use Imatinib, a 

compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt 

thereof, in a pharmaceutical composition for treating tumours, 

the teaching in the Zimmerman Patent did not go further, and 

did not extend to the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, 

which represented a "manipulative step" in the method of 

treating tumours in patients. 

11.15.15 
In view of the above, the Supreme Court held (in para 

105 of the report) that the Zimmerman Patent did teach how to make 

Imatinib Mesylate from Imatinib, and the use of Imatinib Mesylate in 

pharmacological compositions for treating tumours, though the Board 

of Patent Appeals opined that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate might not have been covered by the Zimmerman Patent. 

These findings, held the Supreme Court, were binding on Novartis, 

and could not be revisited. After referring to certain publications on 

the issue, the submission, of Novartis, that Imatinib Mesylate was a 

new invention, vis-à-vis Imatinib, involving technical advance over 

existing knowledge was, unequivocally rejected by the Supreme 

Court, in paras 111 and 113 of the report. Paras 105, 111 and 113 of 

the report in Novartis 17 read thus: 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 82 of 174 

"105. From the above discussion it would be clear that the 
drug Gleevec directly emanates from the Zimmermann Patent 
and comes to the market for commercial sale. Since the grant 
of the Zimmermann Patent, the appellant has maintained that 
Gleevec (that is, Imatinib Mesylate) is part of the 
Zimmermann Patent. It obtained drug approval for Gleevec 
on that basis. It claimed extension of the term of the 
Zimmermann Patent for the period of regulatory review for 
Gleevec, and it successfully stopped NATCO Pharma Ltd. 
from marketing its drug in UK on the basis of the 
Zimmermann Patent. Not only the appellant but the US Board 
of Patent Appeals, in its judgment granting patent for β-
crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, proceeded on the basis 
that though the beta-crystalline form might not have been 
covered by the Zimmermann Patent, the Zimmermann Patent 
had the teaching for the making of Imatinib Mesylate from 
Imatinib, and for its use in a pharmacological composition for 
treating tumours or in a method of treating warm-blooded 
animals suffering from a tumoral disease. This finding was 
recorded by the US Board of Patent Appeals, in the case of 
the appellant itself, on the very same issue that is now under 
consideration. The appellant is, therefore, fully bound by the 
finding and cannot be heard to take any contrary plea. 

***** 

111. In the face of the materials referred to above, we are 
completely unable to see how Imatinib Mesylate can be said 
to be a new product, having come into being through an 
"invention" that has a feature that involves technical advance 
over the existing knowledge and that would make the 
invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art. Imatinib 
Mesylate is all there in the Zimmermann Patent. It is a known 
substance from the Zimmermann Patent. 

***** 

113. We thus find no force in the submission that the 
development of Imatinib Mesylate from Imatinib is outside 
the Zimmermann Patent and constitutes an invention as 
understood in the law of patent in India." 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 83 of 174 

11.15.16 
Paras 114 and 116 of the report went on to record certain 

submissions, advanced by learned Senior Counsel for Novartis, which 

are of considerable significance insofar as the controversy in issue 

before me is concerned and which, in fact, constitutes the fulcrum of 

the debate which the decision in Novartis attracts, in case after case. 

To the extent relevant, paras 114 and 116 of the report may, therefore, 

be reproduced as under: 

"114. Mr Andhyarujina and Mr Gopal Subramanium, learned 
Senior Advocates appearing for the appellant, strenuously 
argued that the patent information furnished by the appellant 
before the US FDA, or its patent term extension application, 
or the legal notice given at its behest to NATCO Pharma Ltd. 
should not be construed to mean that Imatinib Mesylate was 
anticipated in the Zimmermann Patent. Mr Andhyarujina 
submitted that the Zimmermann Patent did not disclose 
Imatinib Mesylate. That the Zimmermann Patent did not 
describe any working method for converting Imatinib to 
Imatinib Mesylate. It only stated that a salt may be formed by 
acid without disclosing any method, but simply calling the 
method to be "per se". The Zimmermann Patent mentioned 
multiple choices of compounds including Imatinib free base 
but not any salt of any compound, much less Imatinib 
Mesylate. Mr Andhyarujina further submitted that it is well 
settled that the disclosure of an invention must be in a manner 
clear enough and complete enough for the invention to be 
performed by a person skilled in the art (Terrell on Law of 
Patents, 16th Edn., p. 51, Para 3.2/7). The learned counsel 
further submitted that there was a difference between that 
which is covered and that which is disclosed. Imatinib 
Mesylate is covered by the Zimmermann Patent but 
not disclosed therein. 
***** 
116. Mr Subramanium further submitted that the scope 
of coverage is distinct from the scope of disclosure in a 
patent. Imatinib Mesylate could be said to be not new and 
known from the Zimmermann Patent only in case there was a 
complete disclosure of the method of its preparation in the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 84 of 174 

Zimmermann Patent. The learned counsel strongly contended 
that coverage under a patent of the Markush kind cannot lead 
to any presumption of disclosure, much less any enabling 
disclosure of all the compounds within the genus. The learned 
counsel further contended that coverage that is granted in 
respect of a patent is not always coextensive with what 
is disclosed in that patent. In certain circumstances, where it 
is a pioneering invention (as in the case of the Zimmermann 
invention), the patent may be entitled to larger coverage than 
what is specifically disclosed in it. The learned counsel 
argued that coverage cannot be used to presume an enabling 
disclosure of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate in 
the Zimmermann Patent. Disclosure in a specification can 
never be presumed, and that is a question of the clear teaching 
contained in the specification. The teaching of a patent lies in 
the disclosure/specification that 
supports 
the 
claim. 
The disclosure describes the invention. The claim defines 
through language the various ways the invention could be 
used i.e. possible but not actualised products. This is the 
scope of protection granted under the patent. For the purpose 
of prior art, it is the disclosure in the specification supporting 
the claim and not the written description or the claims 
themselves, that must be assessed. The claim can never be the 
teaching. He further contended that it would be wrong to say 
that the appellant's claims for β-crystalline form of Imatinib 
Mesylate is a case of double or repeat patenting, that is, the 
same invention is being sought to be patented twice. The 
claim for patent for β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate 
relates to a second and different invention. Though the 
invention in the first part (Imatinib) may be necessary to 
arrive at the invention in the second part, the final product 
does not come into existence without inventions. The 
principle is that if a product is covered, it means that it 
infringes a patent. Whether the patent infringed disclosed 
every aspect of the product in its specification is a separate 
inquiry." 
(Italics in original, underscoring supplied) 

This submission is noted, yet again -thereby emphasizing its 

importance to the entire dispute -in para 125, in which the Supreme 

Court again records the submission, of Mr Andhyarujina and Mr 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 85 of 174 

Subramanium, on behalf of Novartis, "that the coverage or the claim 

and the disclosure or the teaching, had different parameters in a 

patent, and that the former may have extended boundary within which 

disclosure or teaching may be confined to a narrow extent" (with the 

italics provided by the Supreme Court itself, in the judgement). 

11.15.17 
Novartis, therefore, sought to distinguish, in its 

submissions before the Supreme Court, between "coverage" and 

"disclosure", in a patent specification. Even while admitting, in so 

many words, that Imatinib Mesylate was covered by the Zimmerman 

Patent, Novartis nevertheless asserted that Imatinib Mesylate was not 

disclosed by the Zimmerman Patent. Disclosure, it was sought to be 

submitted, was required to be "in a manner clear enough and complete 

enough for the invention to be performed by a person skilled in the 

art". Complete disclosure would also require disclosure of the method 

of preparation of the compound, i.e. the disclosure had to be 

"enabling" in character. It was contended that the Zimmerman Patent, 

while mentioning multiple choices of compounds, including the 

Imatinib free base (and, therefore, being in the nature of a "Markush" 

patent), did not refer to any salt of any compound, much less Imatinib 

Mesylate. Nor was the method for arriving at the salt, from the 

Markush moiety, disclosed. 
Though, therefore, Imatinib was 

necessary to arrive at Imatinib Mesylate, the process was "inventive" 

in nature. The idea was sought to be expressed, otherwise, by 

distinguishing between the "boundary" of the Zimmerman Patent and 

the "enablement" or "disclosure" therein. Though the boundary of the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 86 of 174 

Zimmerman Patent extended up to Imatinib Mesylate, Novartis 

contended that the Zimmerman Patent did not, nevertheless, disclose 

Imatinib Mesylate, in an enabling fashion. 

11.15.18 
Dealing with the submissions, the Supreme Court held, in 

para 118 and 119 of its decision, thus: 

"118. The submissions of Mr Andhyarujina and Mr 
Subramanium are based on making a distinction between 
the coverage or claim in a patent and the disclosure made 
therein. The submissions on behalf of the appellant can be 
summed up by saying that the boundary laid out by the claim 
for coverage is permissible to be much wider than 
the disclosure/enablement/teaching in a patent. 

119. The dichotomy that is sought to be drawn 
between coverage or 
claim 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on the 
other hand, seems to strike at the very root of the rationale of 
the law of patent. Under the scheme of patent, a monopoly is 
granted to a private individual in exchange of the invention 
being made public so that, at the end of the patent term, the 
invention may belong to the people at large who may be 
benefited by it. To say that the coverage in a patent might go 
much beyond the disclosure thus seem to negate the 
fundamental rule underlying the grant of patents." 
(Italics in original; underscoring supplied) 

11.15.19 
Considerable reliance was placed, by learned Senior 

Counsel for Novartis in the Supreme Court, on the decision of the 

United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in In re. Hogan 34 , 

to support the contention "that the Zimmerman Patent is a patent 

covering a genus with certain known species, and many other species 

34 559 F 2d 595 (CCPA 1977) 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 87 of 174 

that were unknown at that time, but which are equally covered by the 

patent, even though there is no enabling disclosure in the patent in 

respect thereof". It is not necessary to refer to Hogan 34 in any great 

detail, as (in para 133 of the report), the Supreme Court held the said 

decision not to be applicable to the facts of the case before it. Having 

noted the above reliance, by learned Senior Counsel for Novartis on 

Hogan 34 , the Supreme Court reiterated its finding that "Imatinib 

Mesylate is a known substance from the Zimmerman Patent". As 

such, the Supreme Court found Hogan 34 , which dealt with the issue of 

whether species which were unknown at the time of the original 

patent, could be covered thereby, in the absence of an enabling 

disclosure, not to be relevant to the facts before it. Having so noted, 

the Supreme Court went on to hold, in para-134 of the report, thus: 

"However, before leaving Hogan and proceeding further, we 
would like to say that in this country the law of patent, after 
the introduction of product patent for all kinds of substances 
in the patent regime, is in its infancy. We certainly do not 
wish the law of patent in this country to develop on lines 
where there may be a vast gap between the coverage and 
the disclosure under the patent; where the scope of the patent 
is determined not on the intrinsic worth of the invention but 
by the artful drafting of its claims by skilful lawyers, and 
where patents are traded as a commodity not for production 
and marketing of the patented products but to search for 
someone who may be sued for infringement of the patent." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

11.15.20 
The Supreme Court, therefore (in para-135 of the report) 

held, in terms, that Imatinib Mesylate did not qualify the test of 

"invention", as contained in clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1) of the 

Patents Act. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 88 of 174 

11.15.21 
Having so held, the Supreme Court went on to examine 

whether the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was patentable, as 

contended by Novartis. This issue, the Supreme Court observed, 

directly brought into play Section 3(d) of the Patents Act. Novartis, 

through learned Senior Counsel, advanced, at this stage, yet another 

ground to contest the applicability of Section 3(d). It was submitted 

that Section 3(d) applied only to new forms of a known substance 

having a known efficacy. Stress was laid on the expression "known", 

to submit that it could not be equated with "conceivable". "Known", 

it was submitted, indicated that the substance, as well as its efficacy, 

had to be proven and well-established, empirically and beyond doubt. 

Novartis submitted that neither Imatinib nor Imatinib Mesylate had 

any known efficacy, so that the requirement of establishing that the β-

crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate had enhanced efficacy over 

Imatinib or Imatinib Mesylate, could not arise at all. The Supreme 

Court rejected (in para 137 of the report) the interpretation suggested, 

by Novartis, of the expression "known", as contained in Section 3(d), 

vis-à-vis the concept of "efficacy". Citing, for the purpose, the 

precedent in Monsanto Co. v. Coromandal Indag Products (P) Ltd 35 

(which interpreted the expression "publicly known", as employed in 

Section 64(1)(e) and (f) of the Patents Act), the Supreme Court 

observed that, apart from the finding, already returned by it, that 

Imatinib Mesylate was a known substance from the Zimmerman 

patent, the NDA submitted by Novartis to the US FDA clearly stated 

35 (1986) 1 SCC 642 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 89 of 174 

that Imatinib Mesylate had undergone extensive preclinical, technical 

and clinical research, along with the details thereof. The efficacy of 

Imatinib, therefore, it was held, was equally known and evident from 

the Zimmerman Patent. Per sequitur, it was held that the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate was, clearly, a new form of a known 

substance, i.e. Imatinib Mesylate, with known efficacy. 

11.15.22 
The fallout, observed the Supreme Court, was that, in 

order for it to be patentable, the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate had necessarily to satisfy the tests contained in the 

substantive Section 3(d) as well as the Explanation thereto. 

11.15.23 
The Supreme Court advanced the following reasons, for 

rejecting the plea of Novartis that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate had enhanced efficacy, vis-à-vis Imatinib, or even vis-à-vis 

Imatinib Mesylate per se: 

(i) 
The patent application filed by Novartis specifically 

acknowledged that "all the indicated inhibitory and 

pharmacological effects" of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate "are also found with the free base … or other cells 

thereof". There could, therefore, be no question of the β-

crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate having any enhanced 

efficacy over the known substance (Imatinib/Imatinib 

Mesylate), of which it was a new form. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 90 of 174 

(ii) Though there was some degree of ambivalence on this 

aspect, the application for grant of patent, filed by Novartis, 

conveyed the impression that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate was derived directly from the Imatinib free base. 

Apropos the claimed "enhanced efficacy" of the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate, vis-à-vis the free base Imatinib, two 

affidavits, by Paul William Manley and Giorgio Pietro 

Massimini, were filed by Novartis. Relevant passages, from the 

said affidavits, were reproduced by the Supreme Court in paras 

147 and 148 of the report, which read thus: 

"147. Manley, in Para 8 of his affidavit, stated: 

"The physical properties of the free base and 
Imatinib Mesylate differ in that the free base is 
only very slightly soluble in water (0.001 g/100 
ml) while Imatinib Mesylate is very soluble in 
water (β-crystalline form: 130 g/100 ml). Other 
physical characteristics of the subject 
compound are described at pp. 2-3 of the 
specification. The attendant advantages because 
of these properties are also simultaneously 
described therein. These characteristics and 
hence the attendant properties/advantages are 
not shared by the free base. Furthermore, the β 
form significantly differs from the alpha form: 

Physical attributes: 

(a) 
The beta crystal form has substantially 
more beneficial flow properties and thus results 
in better processability than the alpha crystal 
form. 

(b) 
The beta crystal form of the 
methanesulfonic acid addition salt is the 
thermodynamically more stable form at room 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 91 of 174 

temperature. Greater stability is thus to be 
expected. 

(c) 
The beta crystal form is less hygroscopic 
than the alpha crystal form of the 
methanesulfonic acid addition salt of a 
compound of Formula I. 

(d) 
The lower hygroscopicity is a further 
advantage for processing and storing the acid 
addition salt in the beta crystal form." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

148. Massimini, in Para 9 of his affidavit stated: 

"A study conducted on rats provided statistical 
evidence for a difference in the relative 
bioavailability of the free base and Imatinib 
Mesylate in the beta crystalline form. In such 
study, a mean AUC (0-48h) value of 264.000 
h*ng/mL was found for the free base compared 
with a mean AUC (0-48h) value of 344000 
h*ng/mL for Imatinib Mesylate having the β-
crystal form. In other words, an about 30% 
improvement in bioavailability was observed 
for the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate 
compared to the free base. The test results are 
attached herewith as Annexure 'A'." 

(iii) These affidavits compared the β-crystalline form of 

Imatinib Mesylate with the free base Imatinib. That, however, 

was insufficient, as the declaration, in the application for grant 

of patent filed by Novartis, as well as in the affidavits, that the 

β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was derived from 

Imatinib in free base form, was based on the premise that the 

Zimmerman Patent extended only to free base Imatinib and did 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 92 of 174 

not cover Imatinib Mesylate. This had already been found to be 

incorrect, in the judgement. That apart, before the Supreme 

Court, Novartis contended that two stages were involved in 

processing from the free base Imatinib to the β-crystalline form 

of Imatinib Mesylate, in which the substance immediately 

preceding the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was the 

non-crystalline Imatinib Mesylate. Novartis had, therefore, 

necessarily to establish enhanced efficacy of the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate over the non-crystalline Imatinib 

Mesylate. No material, whatsoever had, however, been filed by 

Novartis on this aspect. 

(iv) Insofar as the higher solubility, attributed to the β-

crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate in the affidavits filed by 

Novartis, was concerned, that might, quite possibly, had been a 

property of Imatinib Mesylate itself, as it was a well-known fact 

that salts were more soluble than compounds in free base form. 

If solubility were to be excluded, the "additional" properties 

possessed by the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, were 

(i) more beneficial flow properties, (ii) better thermodynamic 

stability and (iii) lower hygroscopicity. 

(v) These additional properties, however, did not amount to 

enhanced efficacy of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate, even vis-à-vis the free base Imatinib. Noting the fact 

that Novartis has already acknowledged the possession, by the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 93 of 174 

free base Imatinib, of all the pharmacological effects of the β-

crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, the Supreme Court went 

on to deal with an additional submission, advanced by Novartis, 

to the effect that the free base Imatinib had little or no 

solubility. This, contended Novartis, rendered the free base 

Imatinib incapable of administration as a drug to human beings, 

as it would "sit in the stomach like a brick and would pass out 

with no therapeutic effect". The methanesulfonic acid addition 

salt of Imatinib made the therapeutic ingredient of the 

compound, which was Imatinib, much more highly soluble and, 

consequently, suitable for administration as a drug to human 

beings. These properties, contended Novartis, were enhanced 

in the β-crystalline form which, therefore, was even more 

suitable for administration as a drug than Imatinib Mesylate. 

Novartis contended that this amounted to "enhanced efficacy". 

(vi) Dealing with this contention, the Supreme Court, in paras 

157 and 158 of the report, explained, in detail, what "efficacy", 

in the context of Section 3(d) of the Patents Act, meant. These 

paras read as under: 

"157. What is "efficacy"? "Efficacy" means "the 
ability to produce a desired or intended result" [The 
New Oxford Dictionary of English, Edn. 1998.]. 
Hence, the test of efficacy in the context of Section 
3(d) would be different, depending upon the result the 
product under consideration is desired or intended to 
produce. In other words, the test of efficacy would 
depend upon the function, utility or the purpose of the 
product under consideration. Therefore, in the case of 
a medicine that claims to cure a disease, the test of 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 94 of 174 

efficacy can only be "therapeutic efficacy". The 
question then arises, what would be the parameter of 
therapeutic efficacy and what are the advantages and 
benefits that may be taken into account for 
determining the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy? 
With regard to the genesis of Section 3(d), and more 
particularly the circumstances in which Section 3(d) 
was amended to make it even more constrictive than 
before, we have no doubt that the "therapeutic 
efficacy" of a medicine must be judged strictly and 
narrowly. Our inference that the test of enhanced 
efficacy in case of chemical substances, especially 
medicine, should receive a narrow and strict 
interpretation is based not only on external factors but 
there is sufficient internal evidence that leads to the 
same view. It may be noted that the text added to 
Section 3(d) by the 2005 Amendment lays down the 
condition of "enhancement of the known efficacy". 
Further, the Explanation requires the derivative to 
"differ significantly in properties with regard to 
efficacy". What is evident, therefore, is that not all 
advantageous or beneficial properties are relevant, but 
only such properties that directly relate to efficacy, 
which in case of medicine, as seen above, is its 
therapeutic efficacy. 

158. While dealing with the Explanation it must also 
be kept in mind that each of the different forms 
mentioned in the Explanation have some properties 
inherent to that form e.g. solubility to a salt and 
hygroscopicity to a polymorph. These forms, unless 
they differ significantly in property with regard to 
efficacy, are expressly excluded from the definition of 
"invention". Hence, the mere change of form with 
properties inherent to that form would not qualify as 
"enhancement of efficacy" of a known substance. In 
other words, the Explanation is meant to indicate what 
is not to be considered as therapeutic efficacy." 
(Italics in original; underscoring supplied) 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 95 of 174 

"Efficacy", when applied to a pharmaceutical product in the 

context of Section 3(d) of the Patents Act has, therefore, 

necessarily to be "therapeutic efficacy". The product must, 

therefore, demonstrate "enhanced therapeutic efficacy", if it is 

one to which Section 3(d) is otherwise attracted. "Therapeutic 

efficacy" cannot, additionally, relates to properties already 

possessed by the "known substance", as was made apparent by 

the Explanation to Section 3(d). 

(vii) Viewed thus, more beneficial flow properties, better 

thermodynamic stability and lower hygroscopicity could not be 

regarded as enhancing the "therapeutic efficacy" of the β-

crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, over the free base 

Imatinib or over the non-crystalline Imatinib Mesylate. 

(viii) Novartis, however, also pleaded that the β-crystalline 

form of Imatinib Mesylate possessed "30% increased 

bioavailability", as compared to the free base Imatinib. In this 

context, the Supreme Court relied on an article titled 

"Appropriateness of Bioavailability and Bioequivalency as Pre-

Market Clearance Considerations" by Jane Moffitt 36 , which 

opined that "a determination that the drug product is 

bioavailable is not in itself a determination of effectiveness". 

Even otherwise, the Supreme Court observed that mere 

increased bioavailability would not necessarily lead to 

36 34 Food Drug Cosm LJ 640 (1979) 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 96 of 174 

enhancement of therapeutic efficacy and that if, in a particular 

case, it did, that was required to be claimed and established, by 

the patent applicant, by research data. No material, to that 

effect, it was noted, was forthcoming before the Supreme Court 

"to indicate that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate 

will produce an enhanced or superior efficacy (therapeutic) on 

molecular basis than what could be achieved with Imatinib free 

base in vivo animal model". 

Thus, held the Supreme Court, the β-crystalline form of Imatinib 

Mesylate had failed the Section 3(d) test. 

11.15.24 
Even while so holding, the Supreme Court went on to 

clarify, ex abundanti cautela, in paras 168 and 169 of the report, that 

Section 3(d), and the requirement of establishing enhanced therapeutic 

efficacy, applied only where the product, for which patent protection 

was sought, was a new form of a known substance with known 

efficacy. In all other cases, what applied was Section 2(1)(j) (which 

defined "invention") which, in the case of chemicals and 

pharmaceuticals, did not necessarily require the product of the 

applicant to be something altogether new, unfamiliar, strange or not 

existing before. It could also "mean something "different from a 

recent previous" or "one regarded as better than what went before" or 

"in addition to another or others of the same kind" " 37 . 

37 Taken from The New Oxford Dictionary of English, Edn. 1998 in para 169 of the report 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 97 of 174 

11.15.25 
As a concluding observation, the Supreme Court took 

note of the fact that Imatinib Mesylate, in its non-crystalline form, had 

been marketed since 2001 as Gleevec and that, consequent to grant of 

exclusive marketing rights on 10 th November, 2003, Novartis was 

marketing Gleevec in India as well. The package, wherein Gleevec 

was sold, described the drug as "Imatinib Mesylate Tablets 100 mg", 

and further declared that "each film-coated tablet contains 100 mg 

Imatinib (as Mesylate)". There was no reference, on the package, to 

the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. What was being sold by 

Novartis, therefore, it was observed, was not the β-crystalline form of 

Imatinib Mesylate, but Imatinib Mesylate per se. This additional fact 

portrayed the case of Novartis, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, 

"in rather poor light", and revealed that the patent claim of Novartis, 

for the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, was only an attempt 

to obtain a patent for Imatinib Mesylate which, otherwise, was not 

permissible in India. 

11.16 
Before proceeding to assess the effect, if any, on the 

present dispute, of Novartis 17 , it is necessary to deal with the 

contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that, in paras 23 to 27 of the plaint and 

in paras 14 to 15 of the replication, the plaintiff has admitted coverage 

of CTPR by Claim 22 in IN'978. Paras 23 to 27 of the plaint and 

Paras 14 and 15 of the replication read as under: 

Paras 23 to 27 of the plaint 

"23. In the interest of full disclosure, the Plaintiffs wish to 
state that apart from the suit patents, the Plaintiffs are also the 
proprietors of a number of other patents, including product, 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 98 of 174 

process and composition patents, protecting insecticidal 
anthranilamides including CTPR. An exemplary list of such 
patents granted in India include: IN 204978, IN213177, 
IN205622, IN215218, IN298645, IN261551, IN284017, 
IN252356 and IN261276. 

24. 
It would be pertinent to mention that the Plaintiffs' 
patent IN 204978 (IN '978) mentioned in paragraph 23 is a 
granted and subsisting genus patent covering a vast number of 
compounds of a class of anthranilamides. The compounds of 
Formula 1 of the suit patent are a novel and inventive 
selection 
from 
the 
disclosure 
of 
IN 
'978. 
CHLORANTRANILIPROLE (CTPR) is not specifically 
disclosed in the genus patent IN '978, although it is within the 
scope of the numerous compounds included in the Markush 
Formula disclosed and claimed in the patent. A person skilled 
in the art would not have recognized CTPR from the genus 
patent. 

25. 
In fact during the prosecution of the application 
corresponding to the suit, patent IN 201307 in the US, a 
Declaration was filed at the United States Patent and 
Trademarks Office (USPTO) comparing compounds 
disclosed in the suit patent with the closest, specifically 
disclosed compounds in IN '978. A copy of the said 
declaration is annexed with the list of documents filed with 
the present plaint. 

26. 
The said Declaration mentions tests conducted with the 
compounds of the selection invention (i.e. suit patent IN '307) 
and a comparison with the closest compounds disclosed in IN 
'978. In the tests, all the new compounds of the suit patent (IN 
'307) showed unexpected and unpredictable superior 
insecticidal activity compared with the closest compounds 
disclosed in IN '978. CTPR is not specifically disclosed in IN 
'978. A person skilled in the art would not arrive at CTPR 
from Formula 1 of IN '978 without human intervention and 
ingenuity on account of extensive, thorough and undue 
experimentation or hindsight knowledge. Nonetheless, CTPR 
is in the class of anthranilamides within the scope of the 
numerous compounds included in the Markush Formula 
disclosed and claimed in the IN '978 patent. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 99 of 174 

27. 
The Plaintiff reserves its right under Order II Rule 2, 
CPC to include any additional patents (as mentioned above) 
as part of the present suit subject to discovery of the complete 
activities of the Defendant herein." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Paras 14 and 15 of replication 

"14. The suit patent specifically discloses and claims CTPR 
by way of a chemical structure and/or specific chemical 
name. One of the main defenses taken by the Defendant 
herein is that CTPR is disclosed and claimed by a previous 
India patent IN '978 and that therefore IN '307 is an invalidly 
granted patent. This contention of the Defendant is false and 
misleading since to qualify as a disclosure in a prior 
publication, the invention, i.e. the compound CTPR in this 
case, has to be specifically and particularly disclosed in the 
prior art either by way of a chemical structure, or a specific 
Chemical/IUPAC name. 

15. 
The Plaintiffs also submit the following: 

i. 
The compounds of formula I of IN'307 are a 
novel and inventive selection from the disclosure of 
IN'978. All of the compounds of the suit patent 
(IN'307) contain a 3-substituted-2-pyridyl ring and 
two substituents (R1 and R2) on the phenyl ring. After 
tedious and painstaking research, it was found that this 
combination of groups leads to compounds with 
unexpected superior insecticidal activity compared to 
other insecticidal anthranilamides disclosed in IN'978. 

ii. 
In fact during the prosecution of the patent 
application corresponding to the suit patent IN 201307 
in the US, a Declaration was filed at the United States 
Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) comparing 
compounds disclosed in the said patent application 
with the closest, specifically disclosed compounds in 
the US equivalent of IN'978. The said Declaration 
mentions tests conducted with the compounds of the 
selection invention (i.e. the patent application 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 100 of 174 

corresponding to suit patent IN'307) and a comparison 
with the closest compounds disclosed in the US 
equivalent of IN'978. In the tests, all the new 
compounds of the suit patent (IN'307) showed 
unexpected and unpredictable superior insecticidal 
activity compared with the closest compounds 
disclosed in IN'978. 

iii. 
Further, the Indian Patents Office has granted 
the suit patent after a thorough examination and after 
being duly satisfied regarding the novelty and 
inventiveness and patentability of the invention 
disclosed in IN'307 over IN'978. Moreover, there had 
been no pre-grant opposition or post grant opposition 
or a revocation proceeding filed against the suit patent 
till the filing of the present suit." 

11.17 Paras 23 to 27 of the plaint and paras 14 and 15 of the 

replication, as extracted hereinabove, do not reveal any admission, on 

the part of the plaintiff, that CTPR is covered by Claim 22 in IN'978. 

What the plaintiff has contended is that CTPR is "within the scope" of 

the class of anthranilamides covered by the Markush formula 

disclosed in Claim 22 in IN'978. There is, therefore, no admission, by 

the plaintiff, either of coverage, or of disclosure, of CTPR in Claim 22 

of IN'978. 

11.18 The "coverage versus disclosure" conundrum, in the light of 
Novartis 17 

11.18.1 
Considerable debate was generated, at the Bar, on the 

exact scope of import of paras 119 and 134 of Novartis 17 , specifically 

with respect to the following three observations/findings, to be found 

therein: 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 101 of 174 

(i) 
"The dichotomy that is sought to be drawn between 

coverage or claim on the one hand and disclosure or 

enablement or teaching in a patent on the other hand, seems to 

strike at the very root of the rationale of the law of patent." (in 

para 119) 

(ii) "To say that the coverage in a patent might go much 

beyond the disclosure thus seems to negate the fundamental 

rule underlying the grant of patents." (in para 119) 

(iii) "We certainly do not wish the law of patent in this 

country to develop on lines where there may be a vast gap 

between the coverage and the disclosure under the patent…" 

(in para 134) 

11.18.2 
The immediate query that these observations of the 

Supreme Court generate is -Has the Supreme Court held that 

"coverage" and "disclosure" are the same, or that "coverage" implies 

"disclosure" 

11.18.3 
Mr. Sethi did not leave any stone unturned in his effort to 

repel the submission, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that the Supreme Court, in 

Novartis 17 held that "coverage" of the patent was the same as 

"disclosure", and that the existence of either one predicated, as a 

necessary corollary, the existence of the other. Pointing out that the 

dispute in Novartis 17 did not even relate to any infringement claim, 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 102 of 174 

Mr. Sethi also sought to distinguish the decision on other parameters, 

already noted hereinbefore. In order to examine the correctness of 

Mr. Sethi's submissions, it would be required, in the first instance, to 

understand what exactly the Supreme Court held, on the aspect of 

coverage vis-à-vis disclosure in the patent and, in the second, to assess 

whether the applicability, of the law enunciated by the Supreme Court 

in this regard, was compromised in view of the factual distinctions 

highlighted by Mr. Sethi. 

11.18.4 
It is true, as held by the Supreme Court itself, that 

propositions enunciated by courts, in judicial decisions, are not to be 

likened to Euclid's theorems 38 . It is equally true that, ordinarily, the 

enunciation of the law by the Supreme Court is to be appreciated in 

the light of the factual and contextual backdrop in which the 

enunciation took place. 39 Equally true is it, however, that, where the 

Supreme Court enunciates or expounds the law in general or omnibus 

terms, clearly intended to be applicable even beyond the peripheries 

of the controversy before it, Courts, hierarchically below the Supreme 

Court, would be well advised not to limit, or their own accord, such 

declaration of the law, to the facts which were before the Supreme 

Court. Any such effort, in my view, would be an affront not only to 

Article 141, but also to Article 144 of the Constitution of India, which 

requires all authorities to act in aid of the Supreme Court.

CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 103 of 174 

11.18.5 
Paras 118, 119 and 134 of the decision in Novartis 17 

have, in my view, to be understood in the light of paras 114 and 116, 

which set out the submissions advanced, before the Supreme Court, 

by learned Senior Counsel Mr. Subramanium and Mr. Andhiyarujina. 

Though the submissions of learned Senior Counsel were, as they 

necessarily had to be, advanced in the light of the factual controversy 

before the Supreme Court, the propositions advanced were general in 

nature, and the findings of the Supreme Court, as contained in paras 

118, 119 and 134 also, in my opinion, equally omnibus. What was 

contended, by learned Senior Counsel, as recorded in paras 114 and 

116 of the report, was that "the scope of coverage is distinct from the 

scope of disclosure in a patent". This argument stands reiterated, in 

the same para (para 116) -"that coverage that is granted in respect of 

a patent is not always co-extensive with what is disclosed in the 

patent". In the light of the Zimmerman invention, learned Senior 

Counsel contended that "the patent may be entitled to larger coverage 

than what is specifically disclosed in it". The teaching in the patent, it 

was contended, lay "in the disclosure/specification that supports the 

claim", which "describes the invention". 
Dealing with these 

submissions, the Supreme Court held, in para 119 of the report, that 

"the dichotomy… sought to be drawn between coverage or claim on 

the one hand and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on 

the other hand, (seemed) to strike at the very root of the rationale of 

the law of patent". The words "in a patent", as used by the Supreme 

Court, indicated of the intent of the Supreme Court to be expounding 

the law in general terms, and not limited to the Zimmerman patent, or 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 104 of 174 

the suit patent before it. In fact, a bare reading of para 118 of the 

report in Novartis 17 makes it clear that the Supreme Court has 

expressed its view with respect to patents in general. The opening 

sentence of para 119 of the report is a proposition couched in absolute 

terms and, in my respectful opinion, it would be folly, on the part of 

this Court, to restrict those observations to the facts of Novartis 17 . 

According to the Supreme Court (and at the cost of repetition), any 

dichotomy, sought to be drawn between coverage or claim, and 

disclosure or enablement or teaching, in a patent, struck at the very 

root of the rationale of patent law. Obviously, the Supreme Court has 

disapproved, in no uncertain terms, of any dichotomy being sought to 

be drawn between coverage and disclosure. 

11.18.6 
Having said that, etymologically, "dichotomy" is not the 

same as "distinction". The Supreme Court has not held that coverage 

and disclosure are the same. Nor has it held that there is no 

distinction between coverage and disclosure. Choosing its words with 

precision, the Supreme Court has held that there is no "dichotomy" 

between "coverage" and disclosure". "Dichotomy" is defined, in the 

Oxford Dictionary, as "a division or contrast between two things that 

are or are being represented as being opposed or entirely different". 

In holding that there can be no dichotomy between coverage or claim, 

on the one hand, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, on the 

other, the Supreme Court has not, therefore, held that they are 

identical. Accepting the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak would require 

this Court to place, in the first sentence in para 119 of the report in 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 105 of 174 

Novartis 17 , the word "dichotomy" with "distinction" or "difference". 

That, I am afraid, I cannot do. Apparently, in fact, the Supreme Court 

has, in disapproving the existence of any "wide gap" between 

coverage and disclosure, clarified that it merely disapproved of any 

dichotomy between these concepts, and was not seeking to hold that 

the concepts were identical. 

11.18.7 
Indeed, the judgement of the Supreme Court, read thus, 

would be in entire accord with the covenants of the Patents Act, which 

make repeated reference, in more than one provision, to 

"disclosure" 40 . Clearly, the framers of the Patents Act did not 

envisage the "claim" or "coverage" of the claim, to be identical to 

"disclosure". Nor, for that matter, has the Supreme Court so held. 

What was being sought to be contended, before the Supreme Court, 

by learned Senior Counsel was that, though the specific claim in the 

Zimmerman patent covered Imatinib with its pharmaceutically 

acceptable salts, and though Imatinib Mesylate was a 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib and, therefore, covered 

by the Zimmerman Patent, it was, nevertheless, not disclosed by it. 

Such an argument, if accepted, would amount to holding that there 

was complete dichotomy between "coverage" and "disclosure", with 

no connection between the two. It would amount to holding that, 

while examining what was disclosed in a patent, the authority, or the 

Court concerned, was to remain oblivious to the coverage of the 

patent. Such a dichotomy, which would result in a "wide gap" 

40 Refer, for instance, to Section 10(4), 11(2), (3), (3A) and (4), 16, 33(2), 54(1), 59(1), 64(1)(h), (i), (m) and 

(p), among others. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 106 of 174 

between coverage and disclosure was, in terms, disapproved by the 

Supreme Court. If, however, there was clear coverage of a product in 

the claim (as was found to exist in the Zimmerman Patent, qua 

Imatinib Mesylate), it would be difficult for the patent holder to 

assert, before the Court, that, despite such coverage, the claim did not 

disclose the product. That, in my view, is what Novartis 17 holds. It 

does not pronounce that coverage and disclosure are identical or 

synonymous terms, in patent law. The submission, by Mr. Sai 

Deepak, to that effect cannot, therefore, be accepted. 

11.18.8 
Proceeding from this premise, the Supreme Court went 

on to hold that, as Imatinib, with its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, 

stood claimed in the Zimmerman patent, and as Imatinib Mesylate 

was a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib, it was also 

claimed in the Zimmerman Patent. It was not open, therefore, to the 

appellants before the Supreme Court to contend that, though Imatinib 

Mesylate was claimed/covered by the Zimmerman Patent, it was not 

disclosed thereby. This would amount to creating a complete divide -

or dichotomy -between coverage, or claim, and disclosure which, 

according to the Supreme Court, was not permissible. In other words, 

something which is specifically claimed or covered by the specific 

claim cannot be disowned by asserting that it was not disclosed. 

11.18.9 
To that extent, the interpretation, of Novartis 17 , as 

advanced by Mr Sai Deepak, commends itself to acceptance. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 107 of 174 

11.18.10 
Where, however, Novartis 17 fails to come to the aid of 

the defendant in the present case, is the point of distinction where, 

unlike the circumstances which obtained before the Supreme Court, 

there is, in the present case, no claim, no coverage and no disclosure, 

by the plaintiff, of CTPR in the genus patent, i.e. Claim 22 of IN'978, 

as I have already opined hereinabove. No question of any dichotomy 

between claim and disclosure, therefore, arises in the present case. 

11.19 Novartis 17 cannot, therefore, assist the case of the defendant. 

11.20 The defendant, in its written statement, asserts, in para 93, that 

the patents IN'978 (the genus patent in the present case), US patent 

5998424 (US'424), US Patent 6020357 (US'357), PCT International 

Publication WO 01/70671 (WO'671), European Patent 0946508 

(EP'508), US Patent 4214090 (US'090) and PCT International 

Application WO 96/16954 (WO'954) "expressly disclosed and/or 

provide sufficient teaching and guidance in respect of 

Chlorantraniliprole and are therefore relevant prior art vis-à-vis 

IN'307". It is further asserted, in para 101, thus: "... Claim 1 of 

IN'307 discloses and claims Chlorantraniliprole. The corresponding 

claim/coverage for Chlorantraniliprole in IN'978 is expressly present 

in Claim 22 as granted". 

11.21 It has already been noticed, hereinabove, that the Markush 

formula claimed in Claim 1 of IN'307 was not, in fact, claimed in 

Claim 22 of IN'978. Insofar as disclosure is concerned, too, I have 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 108 of 174 

already opined that the manner in which the defendant has arrived at 

CTPR, or the Markush structure claimed in Claim 1 of IN'307, from 

Claim 22 of IN'978, in paras 101-102, and 103, of the written 

statement, respectively, indicate that the defendant has cherry picked 

select substitutions from the mass of substitutions suggested in Claim 

22 of IN'978, applying, in the process, hindsight knowledge. There is 

nothing, in the written statement, to indicate the basis for the 

selections made by the defendant, for substitution on the Markush 

moiety claimed in Claim 22 of IN'978. The defendant does not aver, 

or plead, that the teachings in IN'978 contained any such material as 

would propel a person skilled in the art to synthesise, from the 

Markush formula in Claim 22, the compound having the Markush 

formula in Claim 1 of IN'307. No reference is made to any such 

specific or specialised properties of CTPR, to arrive at which requisite 

teaching is contained in IN'978. Prima facie, therefore, the present 

case is one of classic hindsight substitution of radicals on a Markush 

moiety, and cannot be said to make out a case of obviousness, of 

Claim 1 in IN'307 or of CTPR, in Claim 22 of IN'978 or any other 

teaching contained in IN'978, as granted. 

11.22 Mr. Sai Deepak has also contended that, in "multiple patent 

applications and patents", the plaintiff has asserted that CTPR was 

first claimed and disclosed in US 6747047, which was the equivalent 

of IN'978. Additionally, he has submitted that other patentees in the 

same field have, in patent applications filed by them, stated that 

US'047 claimed and disclosed CTPR. He has also sought to

highlight, in this context, the fact that some of the admissions 

contained in the applications relating to these patents were by George 

Philip Lahm, who was one of the inventors of the suit patent and of 

IN'978. 

11.23 Mr. Sethi has contended, in rebuttal, that statements made in 

documents relating to other patents cannot be relied upon or treated as 

evidence, by the defendants, to make out a case of vulnerability of the 

suit patent in the present case, as their validity has not been tested in 

these proceedings. I entirely agree with this submission. While it is 

true that the degree of proof, which the defendant is required to attain, 

is only that of a credible challenge, and the challenge need only to 

disclose vulnerability of the suit patent, rather than a clear cut case for 

revocation, the challenge has, nevertheless, to be credible. Reliance 

on documents filed by other patentees in applications relating to other 

patents, or even on documents filed by the plaintiff itself while 

applying for other patents, cannot be relied upon, prima facie, to plead 

the existence of a credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent. 

These are unrelated documents, pertaining to unrelated patent 

applications. Mr. Sethi is correct in pointing out that the validity of the 

statements have not been tested in the present proceedings and that, 

therefore, at a prima facie stage, this Court cannot hold one way or 

another, relying on such material. Needless to say, this would not 

inhibit the defendant from relying on such material during the course 

of trial in the present case. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 110 of 174 

11.24 Mr. Sethi has relied, for this purpose, on the order, dated 8 th 

December, 2015 in F. Hoffmann-La Roche 22 and, on a reading of the 

said decision, the reliance is found to be apt. In para 61 of the order, 

the Division Bench of this Court has held it to be "a cardinal principle 

of claim construction that the claim must be interpreted on its own 

language and if it is clear then resort cannot be had to subsequent 

statements or documents either to enlarge the scope or to narrow the 

same". In so holding, the Division Bench relied on the earlier 

Division Bench ruling in Merck Sharp & Dohme Corpn v. Glenmark 

Pharmaceuticals 41 , in which, too, it was held that "claim construction 

to determine the coverage in the suit patent is to be determined 

objectively on its own terms with regard to the words used by the 

inventor and the context of the invention in terms of knowledge 

existing in the industry". Equally, reliance was placed on Glaverbel 

SA v British Coal Corpn 42 , which disapproves construction of a plain 

"with an eye on prior material, in order to avoid its effect". 

11.25 The sequitur would be that when, as in the present case, the 

Court has examined Claim 22 of IN'978, vis-à-vis the suit patent, and 

found the submission, of the defendant, that the suit patent was 

disclosed in, taught by, or obvious from Claim 22 of IN'978, to be 

prima facie unacceptable, no occasion would arise for the Court to 

forage through declarations or assertions made by other patentees, or 

even by the plaintiff, while applying for other patents. The text of the 

claims, and of the declarations contained in the complete 

41 2015 (63) PPC 257; FAO (OS) No. 190/2013

CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 111 of 174 

specifications of the genus patent and specie patent, which are before 

the Court, has necessarily to prevail. 

11.26 It cannot be said, therefore, that the defendant has been able to 

establish, prima facie, that CTPR was either claimed, or disclosed, in 

Claim 22 in IN'978, or that Claim 1 of IN'307, or CTPR itself, was 

obvious from Claim 22 in IN'978. 

12. Vulnerability of the suit patent IN'307 on the ground of 
anticipation by prior claiming, under Section 13(1)(b) read with 
Section 64(1)(a) of the Patents Act 

12.1 Mr. Sai Deepak urges that the claims in IN'307 are invalid on 

the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, for which statutory 

recognition is to be found in Section 13(1)(b) 43 read with Section 
64(1)(a) 44 of the Patents Act. In fact, the reliance on Section 13(1)(b) is 

largely superfluous, as the ingredients of the said provision stands 

43 "13. Search for anticipation by previous publication and by prior claim. -

(1) 
The examiner to whom an application for a patent is referred under section 12 
shall make investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether the invention so far as 
claimed in any claim of the complete specification -
(a) 
has been anticipated by publication before the date of filing of the 
applicant's complete specification in any specification filed in pursuance of an 
application for a patent made in India and dated on or after the 1st day of 
January, 1912; 
(b) 
is claimed in any claim of any other complete specification published 
on or after the date of filing of the applicant's complete specification, being a 
specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India and 
dated before or claiming the priority date earlier than that date. 
44 "64. Revocation of patents -

(1) 
Subject to the provisions contained in this Act, a patent, whether granted before or after 
the commencement of this Act, may, be revoked on a petition of any person interested or of the 
Central Government by the Appellate Board or on a counterclaim in a suit for infringement of the 
patent by the High Court on any of the following grounds, that is to say -
(a) 
that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, 
was claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date contained in the complete 
specification of another patent granted in India;" 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 112 of 174 

reiterated in Section 64(1)(a) which, insofar as the liability to revocation 

of a patent is concerned, is self contained. 

12.2 Mr. Sai Deepak submits that, on the satisfaction of three 

conditions, a suit patent would stand invalidated under Section 

13(1)(b)/Section 64(1)(a). These three conditions, to be found in 

either of these provisions, are that (i) the claim in the suit patent is 

claimed in any claim of any other complete specification, (ii) such 

complete specification must have been filed in pursuance of an 

application for a patent in India and (iii) the priority date claimed in 

such complete specification must be earlier in point of time to the 

priority date of the suit patent. If these three conditions are fulfilled, 

Mr. Sai Deepak submits that Section 13(1)(b)/Section 64(1)(a) renders 

the date of publication of the suit patent irrelevant. As such, the fact 

that IN'978 was published after the priority date of IN'307, submits 

Mr. Sai Deepak, makes no difference to the applicability of Section 

13(1)(b). 

12.3 Aropos the first requirement of Section 13(1)(b), which is the 

claiming, of the suit patent (IN'307) in any claim of any other 

complete specification, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on paras 23 to 27 of the 

plaint to contend that the plaintiff has acknowledged and admitted the 

coverage of CTPR within IN'978 i.e. the genus patent. These paras 

already stand reproduced in para 11.16 supra. Mr. Sai Deepak's 

contention is that, having thus admitted the coverage of CTPR under 

IN'978 (which assertion the defendants deny), the only basis for the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 113 of 174 

assertion, by the plaintiff, regarding validity of IN'307, is that CTPR 

is not disclosed in IN'978. This, according to him, is an irrelevant 

consideration, as disclosure forms no part of Section 13(1)(b). In 

other words, Mr. Sai Deepak would contend, irrespective of whether 

the claim in the suit patent is, or is not, disclosed in the earlier genus 

patent, the claim in the suit patent would nonetheless be vulnerable to 

revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, if it 

satisfies the three conditions of Section 13(1)(b). 

12.4 Apropos the second condition, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on the 

bibliographic details of IN'978 and IN'307, as provided in the plaint, 

which indicate that IN'307 claimed priority dates (based on the date 

of filing of the corresponding US patents) of 13 th August, 2001 (vis-à-

vis US 60/311,919), 21 st September, 2001 (vis-à-vis US 60/324,128) 

and 2 nd April, 2002 (vis-à-vis US 60/396,661), whereas IN'978 

claimed the priority dates 22 nd March, 2000 (vis-à-vis US 

60/191,242), 27 th July, 2000 (vis-à-vis US 60/220,232), 11 th 

December, 2000 (vis-à-vis US 60/254,635) and 17 th January, 2001 

(vis-à-vis US 60/262,015). As the earliest priority date of IN'307 is 

later than the latest priority date of IN'978. Mr. Sai Deepak submits 

that the second condition of Section 13(1)(b), with respect to "priority 

of priority dates" also stands satisfied. 

12.5 The third condition in Section 13(1)(b), Mr. Sai Deepak points 

out, obviously stands satisfied as both IN'978 and IN'307 are Indian 

patents. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 114 of 174 

12.6 Having thus attempted to demonstrate that the three conditions 

of Section 13(1)(b)/ Section 64(1)(a), which render IN'307 vulnerable 

to revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming stand 

satisfied, Mr. Sai Deepak submits that no statutory exception or 

defence is available in such a case. Whether, or not, the claim of the 

suit patent has been disclosed in the genus patent, submits Mr. Sai 

Deepak, is entirely irrelevant and foreign to Section 13(1)(b). It is not 

open, in other words, according to Mr. Sai Deepak, for the plaintiff to 

escape the rigour of Section 13(1)(b) by contending that CTPR was 

not disclosed in IN'978. 

12.7 In para 20 of the written submissions filed by the defendant, it 

is additionally asserted thus: 

"Critically, it is not important for the scope of the prior claim 
of the prior patent and the impugned claim of the impugned 
patent to be identical. If it is established that the subject-
matter claimed in the impugned patent falls within the scope 
of/is covered by the prior claim of the prior patent, then the 
claim of the impugned patent is invalid to that extent." 

As such, Mr. Sai Deepak submits that, as "Claim 22 of IN'978 

encompasses within its scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of the 

impugned patent IN'307", the entire Claim 1 of IN'307 is rendered 

vulnerable to revocation. 

12.8 In this context, Mr. Sai Deepak has placed reliance on the 

judgment dated 2 nd December, 1966 of the UK Patents Appeal 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 115 of 174 

Tribunal in In Re: Merck & Co. (MACEK's) Patent 45 , rendered in the 

context of Section 14(1)(c) of the United Kingdom Patents Act, 1949 

(the "UK Patents Act") which, according to Mr. Sai Deepak, is in pari 

materia with Section 13(1)(b) of the Patents Act. Specific reliance 

has been placed on the following passages from the said decision: 

"The 1949 Act introduced this phrase "the invention so far as 
claimed in any claim" not only in section 14 (1)(c) but 
elsewhere in the Act and in particular in section 14(1)(b) 
(prior publication), section 14(1)(d) (prior user) and section 
14(1)(e) (obviousness). The acceptance of the principle of 
multiple priorities required some such introduction, so that it 
cannot be assumed that Parliament in phrasing the alteration 
as it did was intending to do more than to adjust the Act to 
accord with this principle, It would be a matter of surprise if, 
in purporting to do this, the legislature had made a 
fundamental alteration in the principles by which the validity 
of claimed monopolies has hitherto been determined. So far 
as concerns prior publication and prior user, if a claim to a 
manner of manufacture includes one embodiment of it which 
is not new, that claim has always been regarded as invalid 
whatever novel and ingenious embodiments the claim also 
covers (see Molins v. Industrial Machinery Co. Ltd. (1938) 
55 R.P.C. 31). So too with obviousness (Woodrow v. Long 
Humphreys & Co. (1934) 51 R.P.C. 25); and unless and until 
the patentee has been able, by suitable amendment, to exclude 
from the claim the invalid portion of the monopoly, the taint 
of invalidity attaches to it in its fulness and deprives it of 
monopoly effect. 

There would appear to be no ground for construing the 
phrase "the invention so far as claimed in any claim" in 
different senses in the sub-divisions of section 14(1), so that, 
if the cited prior claim on its fair construction can be seen to 
grant as a manner of manufacture that which the later claim 
on its fair construction would re-monopolise, the objection of 
prior claiming is established, and this despite the inclusion in 

45 [1967]6 RPC 157 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 116 of 174 

the later claim of variants of the manner of manufacture to 
which no objection can properly be raised. The later 
circumstance will of course be of concern in the 
determination of the relief to be accorded if and when the 
plea is established, but it cannot shield a vulnerable 
embodiment of the invention claimed from attack on the 
ground of pre-claiming any more effectively than it can from 
the other objections available at the opposition stage." 
(Emphasis provided by the defendant in the written 
submissions) 

(I may note, here, that para 26 of the written submissions filed by the 

defendant also refers to another extract, purportedly from the decision 

in In Re: Merck & Co 45 , but that the said extract does not appear to 

form part of the judgment, and only figures in the head note.) 

12.9 Applying this decision, it is contended by Mr. Sai Deepak that, 

even if Claim 1 in IN'307 included variants which were outside the 

scope of Claim 22 in IN'978, to the extent the claim in Claim 1 of 

IN'307 fell within the scope of Claim 22 of IN'978 -which would 

include the claim for patenting of CTPR -Claim 1 in IN'307 is 

rendered vulnerable, at least prima facie. In this context, he goes on to 

submit that though, ordinarily, any examination of the applicability of 

Section 13(1)(b) would require complete construction of the claims in 

the suit patent and the genus patent, that exercise is obviated in the 

present case, in view of the admission, by the plaintiff, of the 

coverage of CTPR within Claim 22 of IN'978. 

12.10 Responding to the arguments of Mr. Sai Deepak, Mr. Sethi 

submits that Section 13(1)(b) applies only where, on comparison of 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 117 of 174 

claims, the claim in the specie patent is found to be identical to that in 

the genus patent. It is not enough, submits Mr. Sethi, that the claim in 

the specie patent is comprehended in the claim in the genus patent; it 

must be specifically claimed therein. He relies, for this purpose, on 

the ruling of the US Courts of Customs and Patent Appeals in In re. 

Vogel 46 and of the UK Supreme Court in In re. Daikin Kogyo Ltd 47 

which, he submits, also explains In Re: Merck & Co 45 , on which Mr. 

Sai Deepak relied. Mr. Sethi points out that approximately 4000 

compounds have been exemplified in IN'978, none of which is CTPR. 

Apropos the Form 27s filed for IN'978, Mr. Sethi points out that they 

reflected IN'978 as "worked" only after the plaintiff's CTPR products 

CORAGEN and FERTERRA had been manufactured and tested. This 

was because CTPR was encompassed within the scope of IN'978, but 

was not claimed or disclosed therein. To emphasise this distinction, 

Mr. Sethi relies on the judgement of a coordinate bench of this Court 

in Astrazeneca AB v. Emcure Pharmaceuticals 48 . He submits that 

there is a distinction between that which is "encompassed" in a claim 

and that which is claimed or covered thereby. He submits that, if the 

interpretation sought to be advanced by Mr. Sai Deepak were to be 

accepted, it would seriously compromise advancement in 

pharmaceuticals, as, on the principle that all entities which may come 

within the broad coverage of a claimed Markush moiety cannot be 

patented, the incentive to invent superior pharmaceutical products 

would be lost. This is a factor which, submits Mr. Sethi, has been 

46 422 F. 2d. 438 
47 (1974) RPC 18 
48 2020 (81) PPC 588 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 118 of 174 

noted by this Court in its judgement in F. Hoffman la Roche 8 . He 

submits that the insecticidal activity of CTPR was superior to that of 

the compounds envisaged in IN'978. He also submits that the Patents 

Act permits coverage of one product by more than one patent, in 

Sections 3(d), 19, 88(3), 91 and 141. Thus, submits Mr Sethi, the 

objection of Mr Sai Deepak, predicated on Section 64(1)(a)/13(1)(b) 

of the Patents Act, is without substance. 

12.11 Section 64(1)(a) provides, as a ground for revoking a patent 

already granted, claiming, of the invention claimed in the claim of the 

said patent, in a valid claim of earlier priority date, contained in the 

complete specification of another patent granted in India. The 

statutory preconditions, for this clause to apply as a ground for 

alleging invalidation of the suit patent, are that (i) the invention 

claimed in the claim, under consideration, of the suit patent, was 

claimed in another valid claim, (ii) said valid claim was of earlier 

priority date and (iii) said valid claim was contained in the complete 

specification of another patent granted in India (for ease of reference, 

"the prior patent"). A defendant who seeks to allege invalidity, or 

vulnerability, of a suit patent, under Section 64(1)(a), therefore, 

predicates his case on the premise that the prior patent was valid. An 

allegation that the prior patent was invalid is fatal to any challenge to 

the validity of the suit patent under Section 64(1)(a). The defendant 

in the present case, in asserting vulnerability of IN'307 as having been 

anticipated by prior claiming in Claim 22 of IN'978, therefore, has to 

accede to the validity of Claim 22 of IN'978. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 119 of 174 

12.12 Having said that, it is, of course, always open to the defendant, 

as an alternative plea, that Claim 22 of IN'978 was itself invalid. As I 

have already held here in before, however, no challenge to the validity 

of Claim 22 of IN'978 having ever been raised by the defendant, least 

of all in these proceedings, I am not willing to enter into that aspect. I 

proceed, therefore, on the premise that Claim 22 of IN'978 was a 

valid claim, validly granted. 

12.13 CTPR is the "invention… claimed in Claim 1 of the complete 

specification" in IN'307, i.e. the suit patent. The "valid claim of 

earlier priority date" in the prior patent, for the purposes of Section 

64(1)(a), as alleged by Mr. Sai Deepak, is Claim 22 of IN'978. 

Section 64(1)(a) would, therefore, render the suit patent vulnerable if 

CTPR is, prima facie, claimed in Claim 22 of IN'978. 

12.14 I have already held, hereinabove, that CTPR is not claimed, or 

even disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN'978. Claim 22 of IN'978 claims a 

Markush moiety. It is possible to travel from said Markush moiety to 

Claim 1 in IN'307, or to CTPR, only by cherry picking select radicals 

out of the innumerable choices provided in the complete 

specifications accompanying Claim 22 of IN'978, for substitution on 

said Markush moiety. Save and except for demonstrating how, by 

substituting such select radicals, it is possible to move from the 

Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN'978 to Claim 1 of IN'307, or to 

CTPR, the defendant has, in its written statement, not indicated any 

teaching or guidance, available in the complete specifications of 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 120 of 174 

IN'278, as would guide a person skilled in the art to pick the select 

radicals and substitute them on the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of 

IN'978, so as to "lead" him to CTPR. Neither CTPR, nor the 

Markush formula claimed in Claim 1 of IN'307, is obvious from the 

disclosure provided in Claim 22 of IN'978. 

12.15 The defendant appears to be aware of this legal position, as is 

apparent from the assertion, in para 21 of the written submissions filed 

by the defendant that "Claim 22 of IN'978 encompasses within its 

scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of the impugned patent 

IN'307, thereby rendering the entirety of the principal claim of IN 307 

vulnerable to revocation" 49 . The correctness of this argument of the 

defendant appears to be somewhat doubtful and, in fact, also appears 

to be contrary to the contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that the words 

used in Section 13(1)(b) have to be strictly construed. While 

advancing this contention, the defendant has introduced two new 

concepts, which find no place in Section 13(1)(b), viz. the concepts of 

"scope" and "coverage". Section 13(1)(b) clearly applies where a 

claim in the suit patent "is claimed in any claim of any other complete 

specification". It does not make any reference either to the scope of 

the claim or the coverage of the claim. What is required therefore, 

prima facie, is comparison of the claims, not whether the claim in the 

suit patent is covered by or within the scope of the claim in the genus 

patent. This position is also conceded by the defendant, in its written 

submissions, by accepting that, ordinarily, a challenge of anticipation 

49 Refer para 12.8 supra 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 121 of 174 

by prior claiming has to be decided on a claim-to-claim comparison. 

The defendant would seek to contend that, in the present case, this 

exercise is obviated because of the admission -as the defendant 

would perceive it -by the plaintiff, in its plaint and replication, of the 

coverage of CTPR in Claim 22 of IN'978. No such admission is, as 

already held here in before, discernible from the paragraphs on which 

the defendant seeks to place reliance. A claim-to-claim comparison, 

even as per the defendant is, therefore, necessary, in order to examine 

the applicability of Section 64(1)(a) -or, for that matter, Section 

13(1)(b) -to the facts of the present case. Such comparison, when 

undertaken, does not make out a prima facie case that these provisions 

apply. 

12.16 The defendant has made a strained effort to justify invocation of 

Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a) by contending that, even if Claim 1 in 

IN'307 includes variants which were outside the scope of Claim 22 in 

IN'978, the former claim was, nonetheless, rendered prima facie 

vulnerable to the extent it fell within the scope of Claim 22 of IN'978, 

i.e. to the extent it claimed CTPR. Neither Section 13(1)(b), nor 

Section 64(1)(a), in my considered opinion, lends itself to such an 

interpretation. All that these provisions require the Court -or 

authority before whom the challenge to the validity is raised -to do is 

to assess whether the invention, insofar 

12.17 as it has been claimed in the suit patent, was, or was not, 

claimed in the prior patent. CTPR, directly or indirectly, is not 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 122 of 174 

claimed in Claim 22 of IN'978. The highest that the defendant can 

assert, at least at this juncture, is that CTPR, as an arthropodicidal 

anthranilamide, falls within the broader Markush coverage of Claim 

22 of IN'978. In the discussion here in before, I have already opined 

that the sequitur of any such coverage cannot be that CTPR has been 

claimed in Claim 22 of IN'978. 

12.18 What Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend is, essentially, this: "Let 

us assume CTPR was not disclosed in IN'978. No matter, as 

disclosure is irrelevant for the purposes of Section 13(1)(b). The 

plaintiff has acknowledged that CTPR comes within the coverage of 

Claim 22 of IN'978. That is sufficient to make out, at least on a 

prima facie basis, a case of vulnerability of the suit patent, under 

Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a)." There is, in my view, a subtle fallacy in 

this argument. The Patents Act does not define "coverage". Indeed, 

coverage, as a concept, is not even envisaged by the Patents Act. In 

patent law, there are coverages and coverages. 
Where the 

substitutions to be effected on the claimed moiety are limited and 

easily discernible to a person skilled in the art, the resultant products 

may be obvious from the genus patent, and any separate species patent 

issued in respect of such products may become vulnerable to 

revocation. Where, however, the genus claim is in the form of a 

Markush formula, with multifarious suggested substitutions, they, 

unless the complete specifications of the genus patent instruct, or 

teach, the person skilled in the art to effect the requisite substitutions 

in order to arrive at the specie patent, the specie patent cannot be 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 123 of 174 

treated as vulnerable to revocation. The question is, ultimately, one of 

degree. No cast iron formula is possible, and it would be for the Court 

to examine, from the genus patent and specie patent, as to whether the 

latter is obvious from the former. Mere coverage, therefore, does not, 

in every case, result in obviousness. In the present case, even if the 

Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 of IN'307, or CTPR itself, falls 

within the overall coverage of the Markush structure claimed in Claim 

22 of IN'978 that, by itself, cannot result in any claiming, in Claim 22 

of IN'978, of CTPR, or of the Markush structure claimed in Claim 1 

of IN'307. 

12.19 In Re: Merck & Company 45 is, in my view, clearly 

distinguishable. Merck, in that case, applied for a patent, which was 

opposed on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming. The 

invention, for which Merck sought to patent, was "a composition 

having enhanced bactericidal activity comprising novobiocin in 

combination with at least one other antibiotic selected from the 

following, namely, penicillin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, 

chlortetracycline, 
streptomycin, 
chloramphenicol, 
bacitracin, 

neomycin, spiramycin, streptothricin and grisein". Thus, the claim 

was comprehensive in nature, permitting alternative additions to 

novobiocin, in the form of one or more of the named antibiotics. The 

Patents Appeal Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), before which the case came 

up, observed that the prior claim, in that case, read "A therapeutic 

composition, comprising novobiocin and a tetracycline". Merck's 

claim also included, expressly, novobiocin with tetracycline, 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 124 of 174 

oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline as suggested additives. 

Elucidating the principle of anticipation by prior claiming, correctly, 

as whether "the cited prior claim on its fair construction can be seen to 

grant as a manner of manufacture that which the latter claim on its fair 

construction would re-monopolise", the Tribunal held that Merck's 

patent stood claimed, prior in point of time, by the prior patent. The 

prior patent, it was noted, clearly claimed novobiocin and tetracycline 

combinations, to which Merck's claim extended. 

12.20 This case, in fact, presents a classical example of an instance in 

which the prior genus patent, though worded in general terms, may 

still invalidate a subsequent specie patent, where the latter is, to a 

person skilled in the art, obvious from the former. In the case before 

the Tribunal, in fact, the degree of skill required to be possessed by 

the "person skilled in the art" was also minimal, as, in effect, both 

genus and species patents claimed novobiocin in combination with a 

tetracycline. There is obviously no similarity, whatsoever, between 

the facts in In Re: Merck & Co. 45 and the present. In Re: Merck & 

Co 45 did not even deal with a Markush claim. 

12.21 In view thereof, no prima facie case of invalidity, or even 

vulnerability, of Claim 1 of IN'307, or of CTPR, on the ground of 

anticipation by prior claiming, under Section 64(1)(a), can be said to 

have been made out.

13. Alleged invalidity of suit patent on the ground of anticipation 

by prior publication and lack of novelty -Section 64(1)(e) 

13.1 Section 64(1)(e) states where the invention, so far as claimed in 

the suit patent, is not new, having regard to either (i) what was 

publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the 

claim in the suit patent or (ii) what was published in India or 

elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. Unlike 

Section 64(1)(a), therefore, which is a self-contained provision, 

Section 64(1)(e) refers us back to Section 13. Sub-sections (1)(a) and 

(2) of Section 13 are relevant, and maybe reproduced thus: 

"13. Search for anticipation by previous publication and 
by prior claim -

(1) 
The examiner to whom an application for a 
patent is referred under section 12 shall make 
investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether 
the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the 
complete specification -

(a) 
has been anticipated by publication 
before the date of filing of the applicant's 
complete specification in any specification filed 
in pursuance of an application for a patent made 
in India and dated on or after the 1 st day of 
January, 1912; 

***** 

(2) 
The examiner shall, in addition, make 
investigation for the purpose of ascertaining, whether 
the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the 
complete specification, has been anticipated by 
publication in India or elsewhere in any document 
other than those mentioned in subsection (1) before the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 126 of 174 

date of filing of the applicant's complete 
specification." 

Whether under clause (1)(a) or (2), what Section 13 requires is 

publication of the invention, claimed in the suit patent, in any 

document, before the date of filing of the complete specification in the 

suit patent. 

13.2 Mr. Sai Deepak alleges that CTPR was disclosed and published 

in the US'424, US'357 and EP'508 patents, all of which were granted 

and published before the earliest priority date of IN'978. He submits 

that CTPR was within the coverage of the Markush structure as 

claimed in US'424, US'357 and EP'580, albeit in the context of 

pharmaceuticals. For this reason, he submits that the suit patent is 

also vulnerable as lacking any inventive step. Paras 112 to 131 of the 

written statement filed by the defendant, which contain the relevant 

assertions in this regard, may be reproduced thus: 

"UNITED STATES PATENT 5998424 (HEREINAFTER

PCT INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATION WO0l/70671 
(WO'671) 

122. WO 01/70671 (WO'671) was filed on 20.03.2001 
much before IN'307 or IN'332 and claims an effective 
priority date of 22.03.2000. This application was also filed by 
Du Pont and is titled Insecticidal Anthranilamides. It was 
published on 23.09.2001 and therefore is relevant and 
material prior disclosure which has fallen in the public 
domain. 

123. WO'671 through its abstract and written description 
provides a compound of the general formula as given below: 

124. WO'671 also states that in the above general formula 
certain specific substitutions can be made. A bare reading of 
the substitutions and selection from those listed in WO'671 as 
given below leads inextricably to Chlorantraniliprole and its 
intermediates. 
-A and B are O; 
-each J is independently a 5-or 6-membered heteroaromatic 
ring wherein each ring is optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R 7 ; 
-n is 1 to 4; 
-R l is H; 
-R 2 is H; 
-R 3 is C1-C6 alkyl 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 131 of 174 

-each R 4 is independently C1-C6 alkyl or halogen; 
-each R 7 is independently halogen. 

125. It is submitted that the above clearly discloses, and 
encompasses Chlorantraniliprole and its intermediates. It is 
further submitted that WO'671 in the description provided on 
internal pages 37 to 42 as well as in Table 9 on page 75 again 
clearly discloses not only the same method as IN'332, but 
also the same intermediate formation. Page 163 of WO'671 
discloses the same use of the compounds encompassed in 
WO'671 i.e. Chlorantraniliprole for the prevention of 
Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Homoptera as well 
as Thysanoptera. 

126. Thus, it is amply clear that WO'671 provides the 
necessary teaching and guidance to a person of ordinary skill 
to manufacture and use Chlorantraniliprole for the same 
purposes as IN'307 and IN'332. 

127. It is submitted that all of the above substitutions 
outlined above are expressly provided for and encompassed 
and disclosed and claimed in WO'671. It is submitted that 
WO'671 is a relevant document in as much as it relates to the 
same field and originates from the same source. It is 
submitted that for the reasons aforesaid, WO'671 clearly and 
unambiguously 
discloses 
Chlorantraniliprole 
thereby 
rendering IN'307 liable to be revoked on the ground of 
anticipation by prior publication.

R 4 , at each occurrence, is selected from halo, C1-4 alkyl, r, 
at each occurrence, is selected from 0. 

131. It is submitted that all of the above substitutions 
outlined above are expressly provided for and encompassed 
and disclosed and claimed in EP'508. It is submitted that for 
the reasons aforesaid, EP'508 clearly and unambiguously 
discloses Chlorantraniliprole thereby rendering IN'307 liable 
to be revoked on the ground of anticipation by prior 
publication." 

13.3 Responding to the submission, Mr. Sethi contends, in the first 

instance, that there cannot be any anticipation by a Markush claim. 

For this proposition, he relies on the decision of the Federal Court of 

Australia in Eli Lilly & Co. Ltd v. Apotex Pty Ltd 50 . Besides, he 

submits, disclosure of the subject matter of the suit patent, in the 

alleged prior patent, is mandatory for an allegation of anticipation by 

prior publication. He submits that CTPR cannot be derived by a 

person skilled in the art, from the disclosure in any of the alleged prior 

patents on which Mr. Sai Deepak relies, except by cherry picking on 

50 (2013) FCA 214 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 137 of 174 

hindsight analysis. As such, he submits that CTPR is not disclosed in 

any of these patents, namely US'424, US'357 and EP'508. EP'508, 

in fact, he submits is the European equivalent of US'357 and has been 

separately cited by the defendant only to make it appear that there has 

been anticipation by a multitude of prior patents. US'424 and 

US'357, submits Mr. Sethi, are in the nature of Markush claims 

enveloping millions of compounds. It cannot be said that, in these 

patents, CTPR was published. Apart from Eli Lilly 19 , Mr. Sethi relies 

on Dr Reddy's Laboratories 26 . 

13.4 On the allegation, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that, in the production of 

CTPR, there is no "inventive step" involved, Mr. Sethi submits that no 

person, skilled in the art, was in the position to produce CTPR from 

any of the alleged prior art documents on which Mr. Sai Deepak 

places reliance. Nor, he points out, has any material been produced 

by the defendant to support such a submission. He highlights the fact 

that, till the suit patent, CTPR was never invented by anyone after 

publication of IN'978. CTPR, in fact, he submits, was a selection 

patent, out of the Markush structure claimed in Claim 22 of IN'978. 

Relying on Farbenindustrie 21 , Mr. Sethi submits that such selection 

patents, so as to obtain additional or advantageous results, are valid. 

He relies, additionally, on Merck Sharp & Dohme Corpn 41 , Takeda 

Chemical Industries v. Alphapharm 51 and the judgment of a 

coordinate Single Bench of this Court in Bristol Myers Squibb 

51 492 F. 3d. 1350

Holdings Ireland Ltd v. B.D.R. Pharmaceuticals International Pvt 

Ltd 52 . 

13.5 Section 64(1)(e) starts with the words "that the invention so far 

as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not new". 

This necessarily refers us back to the definition of "new invention" in 

clause (l) of Section 2 as meaning "any invention or technology which 

has not been anticipated by publication in any document or used in the 

country or elsewhere in the world before the date of filing of patent 

application with complete specification, i.e., the subject matter has not 

fallen in public domain or that it does not form part of the state of the 

art". "Anticipation", when used in the Patents Act, has its own 

peculiar legal connotation. Though "anticipation", per se, is not 

separately defined, Section 13 provides for anticipation only by prior 

publication or by prior claim. Section 64(1)(e) deals with the liability 

of a patent to revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior 

publication. In order for anticipation by prior publication to constitute 

the basis for revoking a patent under Section 64(1)(e), it is necessary 

that, consequent to such anticipation, the patent is no longer "new"; 

which in other words, the invention patented thereby has lost its 

character as a "new invention", by reason of anticipation by prior 

publication. Section 64(1)(e), therefore, requires satisfaction of two 

indicia, viz. (i) that there has been anticipation by prior publication 

and (ii) as a consequence, the invention cannot be treated as a "new 

invention". This is counterbalanced by the definition of "new 

52 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1700 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 139 of 174 

invention", which envisages absence of novelty either on account of 

anticipation by publication, or on account of use. We are not, in the 

present case, concerned with loss of novelty on account of prior use of 

the invention in the suit patent, i.e. CTPR, no such case having been 

pleaded by the defendant. The defendant pleads loss of novelty on the 

ground of anticipation by prior publication. 

13.6 Section 64(1)(e) is, on a plain reading, somewhat peculiarly -

and significantly -worded. The words "before the priority date of the 

claim" succeeds the first part of the clause, i.e. the words "what was 

publicly known or publicly used in India". No such caveat as to time 

follows the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with 

publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to 

in Section 13. Three circumstances are, therefore, contemplated, in 

Section 64(1)(e) as divesting the invention in the suit patent of 

novelty, viz. (i) public knowledge in India before the priority date of 

the claim in the suit patent, (ii) public usage in India before the 

priority date of the claim in the suit patent and (iii) publication in 

India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. 

Section 64(1)(e) does not, therefore, envisage publication of the 

invention in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in 

Section 13 prior to the priority date of the claim in the suit patent. 

The reference, by Mr. Sethi, to the priority date of the suit patent, does 

not, therefore, appear to be appropriate, in view of the manner in 

which Section 64(1)(e) has been crafted by the legislature. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 140 of 174 

13.7 That does not, however, mean that the circumstance of prior 

publication, envisaged in the second part of Section 64(1)(e), is 

completely open ended, with no terminus ad quem. What, then, is the 

terminus ad quem, for the purposes of prior publication under Section 

64(1)(e) ? The legislature has not deemed it appropriate to provide a 

terminus ad quem for the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals 

with the prior publication, apparently because this part of the clause is 

to be read in conjunction with Section 13, which provides the 

appropriate terminus ad quem, in clauses (1)(a) and (2), which have 

already been reproduced hereinabove, and which envisage 

anticipation by prior publication. The terminus ad quem provided in 

respect of anticipation by prior publication, in clauses (1)(a) and (2) of 

Section 13, is the "date of filing of the applicant's complete 

specification", and not the priority date of the suit patent. The priority 

date of the suit patent is, therefore, prima facie irrelevant for the 

purposes of vulnerability on the ground of anticipation by prior 

publication, Section 64(1)(e) read with Section 13 of the Patents Act. 

What has to be seen is whether, prior to the date of filing of the 

complete specification in the suit patent, the invention, i.e. CTPR in 

the present case, was published in India or elsewhere in any 

document. 

13.8 Can there be publication of a patent, relating to an invention 

without disclosure of the invention in the patent? 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 141 of 174 

13.9 Publication involves making known to the public the patent 

application. Every application is required to disclose the invention for 

which it relates. Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Patents Act 4 

(already reproduced above) specifically requires disclosure, in the 

complete specification of the patent, not only of the invention, its 

operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed, but 

also its claims defining the scope of the invention for which protection 

is claimed. In order, therefore, for the defendant to be able to 

successfully allege that CTPR was published in US'424 and US'357 

(being the US equivalent of EP'508), the defendant would have to 

establish that CTPR was disclosed in these patents. 

13.10 IN'307 claims "Arthropodicidal Anthranilamides". 
The 

opening paragraphs of the Complete Specifications of IN'307, which 

sets out the background of the invention, specifically state that the 

invention "relates to certain Anthranilamides, their N-oxides, 

agriculturally suitable salts and compositions, and methods of their 

use for control of the invertebrate pests such as arthropods in both 

agronomic and non-agronomic environments". US'424 is titled 

"Inhibitors of Factor XA with a Neutral P1 Specificity Group". The 

opening Abstract in the Complete Specification states that the 

application "describes inhibitors of factor Xa with a neutral P1 

specificity group of formula I: 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 142 of 174 

or pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof, wherein R and E 

may be groups such as methoxy and halo". The Field of the Invention 

is described thus: 

"This invention relates generally to novel inhibitors of factor 
Xa with a neutral P1 specificity group, pharmaceutical 
compositions containing the same, and methods of using the 
same as anticoagulant agents for treatment and prevention of 
thromboembolic disorders." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Similarly, US'357 is titled "Nitrogen Containing Heteroaromatics as 

Factor XA Inhibitors". The Abstract, towards the commencement of 

the complete specifications, reads thus: 

"The present application describes nitrogen-containing 
heteroaromatics and derivatives thereof of formula I: 

or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug forms thereof, 
wherein J is N or NH and D may be C(=NH)NH2, which are 
useful as inhibitors of factor Xa." 

The Field of the Invention is described thus: 

"This invention relates generally to nitrogen-containing 
heteroaromatics which are inhibitors of trypsin -like serine 
protease enzymes, especially factor Xa, pharmaceutical 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 143 of 174 

compositions containing the same, and methods of using the 
same as anticoagulant agents for treatment and prevention of 
thromboembolic disorders." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Neither of these patents claims, or discloses, CTPR. Besides, they are 

pharmaceutical patents, relating to pharmaceutical products for 

therapeutic administration. There is also substance in Mr. Sethi's 

contention that these are also Markush claims, and cannot, therefore, 

be said to "teach" synthesising of CTPR. I am unable, prima facie, to 

convince myself that CTPR stands claimed, or disclosed, in these 

patents. Sans any claim or disclosure of CTPR, it cannot be said that 

CTPR was published either in US'424 or US'357 (or, therefore, in 

EP'508). 

13.11 I also find, in this context, prima facie substance in the 

contention of Mr. Sethi that, in asserting that Claim 1 of US'424 and 

US'357 leads the person skilled in the art to CTPR, the defendant has, 

as in the case of Claim 22 of IN'978, cherry picked selected 

substituents from the substituents suggested in the complete 

specifications relating to the said claims. This is apparent from paras 

114 and 119 of the written statement, which already stand reproduced 

(supra). 

13.12 Para 120 of the written statement further contends that, in 

Example 66 of US'357, the reaction scheme, leading to the 

preparation of CTPR, is disclosed. Unfortunately, while raising all 

these contentions, predicated on US'424 and US'357, the defendant 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 144 of 174 

has not chosen to place the complete specifications relating to the said 

patent on record. At a prima facie stage, this fact by itself would be 

sufficient to reject these contentions as making out a case of 

vulnerability of the suit patent. The plaintiff has, however, filed the 

said complete specifications of US'424 and US'357, as granted. I am 

unable to find, in Example 66 in US'357, anything to substantiate the 

averment, in that regard, contained in para 120 of the written 

statement. I may note, here, that no oral arguments, explaining this 

assertion in the written statement, were advanced at the Bar; nor do 

the written submissions of the defendant enlighten on this aspect. 

Nevertheless, for the sake of clarity, Example 66 in US 357 is 

reproduced thus: 

"EXAMPLE 66 

1-(3-amidinophenyl)-5-[(2'-aminosulfonyl)-3-chloro-[1,1']-
biphen -4-yl)aminocarbonyl]-3-methylpyrazole 

Part A: 1-(3-cyanophenyl)-3-methyl-pyrazol-5-yl carboxylic

Part B: The bromo compound from part A (0.4 g, 0.96 mmol), 
2-t-butylsulfonamide phenylboronic acid (0.32 g, 1.2 mmol), 
2M sodium carbonate (1 mL), and 1:1 toluene/ethanol were 
combined and degassed with nitrogen. Tetrakibiphen-

How Example 66, as extracted, can be said to teach the manner or 

mode of preparation of CTPR, prima facie defeats comprehension. 

13.13 Equally, the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak that the suit patent 

is vulnerable for lack of any inventive step, also, prima facie, fails to 

impress. Bar a bald averment, no material substantiating this 

contention is forthcoming from the written statement or from the 

written submissions filed by the defendant. Mr. Sethi is correct in his 

submission that, had the invention of CTPR by the plaintiff lacked any 

inventive step, there is no explanation as to why, till CTPR was 

synthesised by the plaintiff, no other manufacturer, including the 

defendant, managed to do so despite, as the defendant would seek to 

contend, so many prior art documents being in existence. 

13.14 At the cost of repetition, it merits emphasis that, in order to 

make out a case of teaching, by a Markush claim in a prior art 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 146 of 174 

document, of the suit patent, the defendant would have to establish not 

only that the substitutions, on the Markush moiety, the effecting of 

which would be necessary to arrive at the suit patent are clearly 

disclosed in the prior art, but also, additionally, that the prior art 

contains the requisite teaching which would motivate the person 

skilled in the art to carry out the said substitutions. Ordinarily, this 

would require guidance, in the prior art document, regarding the 

additional advantages which would result, if the substitutions in 

question were made on the Markush moiety claimed therein. In the 

present case, prima facie, neither of these twin requirements stands 

satisfied despite the manifold grounds of challenge raised by the 

defendant, assiduously canvassed, on its behalf, by Mr. Sai Deepak. 

14. Re. Section 53(4) 

14.1 Mr. Sai Deepak also presses, into service, Section 53(4) of the 

Patents Act, which reads as under: 

"Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the 
time being in force, on cessation of the patent right due to 
non-payment of renewal fee or on expiry of the term of 
patent, the subject matter covered by the said patent shall not 
be entitled to any protection." 

As, in his submission, CTPR stands covered by Claim 22 in IN'978, 

Mr. Sai Deepak submits that, on expiry of the term of IN'978 on 20 th 

March, 2021, the protection available to CTPR from exploitation 

would cease and CTPR would become available in the public domain. 

This, he submits, cannot be avoided by recourse to IN'307, in view of 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 147 of 174 

Section 13(1)(b) read with Section 64(1)(a). 

14.2 The submission does not survive for consideration, in view of 

the finding, hereinabove, that CTPR is, in fact, neither claimed nor 

disclosed in Claim 22 of IN'978. 

14.3 That apart, a bare reading of Section 53(4) reveals that it is 

claim-specific and invention-specific. 
Section 53(4) applies, 

therefore, individually and independently, to IN'978 and the suit 

patent (IN'307). Irrespective, therefore, on the expiry of IN'978, the 

protective umbrella of Section 53(4) would continue to remain 

available to IN'307, being a granted patent, till such time IN'307 is 

invalidated by a competent forum. Expressed otherwise, Section 

53(4) cannot authorise exploitation of the invention covered by the 

specie patent by third parties even before the expiry of the specie 

patent, on the presumptive assertion that the specie patent is invalid, 

whether on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, anticipation, 

by prior publication, or any other ground. 

14.4 I cannot, therefore, agree with Mr. Sai Deepak, even as regards 

the applicability of Section 53(4) of the Patents Act. 

15. Re. Section 3(d) read with Section 64(1)(d) 

15.1 Though this submission of Mr. Sai Deepak, too, does not 

survive for consideration in view of the findings already returned by 

me, it may, nevertheless, be briefly noticed. Section 64(1)(d) 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 148 of 174 

provides, as one of the grounds for revocation of a granted patent, the 

ground "that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is 

not an invention within the meaning of this Act". Mr. Sai Deepak's 

submission is that CTPR is not an "invention" within the meaning of 

the Patents Act. Juxtaposed with this, Mr. Sai Deepak invokes 

Section 3(d) to contend that, in the absence of any data demonstrating 

added efficacy of CTPR over which the invention is claimed in 

IN'978, the suit patent is also invalid under Section 3(d). 

15.2 The submissions are interconnected, and effectively stand 

decided by the findings hereinbefore. The basis for this contention is 

elucidated, in para 48 of the written submissions of the defendant, in 

which it is contended that "the complete specifications of the genus 

patent IN'978 and the suit Species Patent IN'307 are identical in all 

material respects with no additional data on efficacy which renders the 

patent vulnerable to revocation under Section 64(1)(d) in view of 

Section 3(d) of the Act". Reference has been invited, by the 

defendant, in this context, to page 399, vis-à-vis page 76 of the 

defendant's documents. These are the opening pages of the suit patent 

(IN'307) and the genus patent (IN'978) respectively. The suit patent 

is titled "Arthropodicidal Anthranilamides", whereas the genus patent 

is titled "Insecticidal Anthranilamides". The textual "identity" of the 

complete specifications of these two patents, as emphasised in para 48 

of the written submissions of the defendant, however, is limited to the 

initial recital containing the "Background of the Invention". The 

"Summary of the Invention", which follows the "Background", as 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 149 of 174 

well as all that follows thereafter, are totally different in the two 

patents. For ready reference, the "Summary of the Invention" in 

IN'978 and IN'307 are reproduced thus:

Summary of the invention in IN'307 

"SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

This invention pertains to a compound of Formula 1, its N-
oxide or an agriculturally suitable salt of the compound 

wherein 
R l is CH3, F, Cl orBr; 
R 2 is F, CI, Br, I or CF3; 
R 3 is CF3, Cl, Br or OCH2CF3; 
R 4a is C1-C4 alkyl; 
R 4b is H or CH3; and, 
R 5 is CI or Br. 

This invention also pertains to a composition for controlling 
an invertebrate pest comprising a biologically effective 
amount of a compound of Formula 1 and at least one 
additional component selected from the group consisting of 
surfactants, solid diluents and liquid diluents. This invention 
also pertains to a composition comprising a biologically 
effective amount of a compound of Formula 1 and an 
effective amount of at least one additional biologically active 
compound or agent. 

This invention also pertains to a method for controlling an 
invertebrate pest comprising contacting the invertebrate pest 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 158 of 174 

or its environment with a biologically effective amount of a 
compound of Formula 1 (e.g., as a composition described 
herein). This invention also relates to such method wherein 
the invertebrate pest or its environment is contacted with a 
biologically effective amount of a compound of Formula 1 or 
a composition comprising a compound of Formula 1 and a 
biologically effective amount of at least one additional 
compound or agent for controlling invertebrate pests. 

This invention further relates to a benzoxazinone compound 
of Formula 2 

wherein 
R 1 is CH3, F, Cl or Br; 
R 2 is F, CI, Br, I or CF3; 
R 3 is CF3, Cl, Br or OCH2CF3; and 
R 5 is Cl or Br; 

which is useful as a synthetic intermediate for preparing a 
compound of Formula l. 

This invention also relates to a pyrazolecarboxylic acid 
compound of Formula 4 

wherein 

R 3 is CF3, CI, Br or OCH2CF3; and 
R 5 is Cl or Br; 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 159 of 174 

which is useful as a synthetic intermediate, for preparing a 
compound of Formula 1." 

The contention, in para 48 of the written submissions of the 

defendant, that "there is no difference whatsoever in any aspect of the 

disclosure" is, therefore, erroneous and is accordingly rejected. 

15.3 Para 48 of the written submissions of the defendant further 

asserts that "there is no reason stated either in IN'307 for selecting a 

particular molecule from the Markush disclosed in IN'978, nor is any 

additional efficacy either hinted or suggested or disclosed". This 

contention, too, does not appear to be correct, prima facie. Mr. Sethi 

has pointed out that as many as 13 tests have been explained, in the 

"Biological Examples of the Invention", in the complete 

specifications of IN'307, which explained the superior insecticidal 

activity of CTPR. These superior insecticidal qualities of CTPR also 

stand borne out in the affidavit of the inventor George Lahm, as filed 

before the US Patents and Trademarks Office along with the 

declaration filed for registration of the US'836 patent, the equivalent 

of the IN'307 patent. It is averred, in the said affidavit, thus: 

"I am familiar with the subject matter of the present 
application and the subject matter of U.S. Patent 6,747,047 of 
which I am also a named inventor. Both the present 
application and U.S. Patent 6.747,047 encompass within their 
subject matter certain insecticidal anthranilamides. U.S. 
Patent 6,747,047 discloses a broad scope wherein, for 
example, J (the ring moiety directly attached to carbonyl) is 
defined as optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl or, a 5-10 
membered heteroaromatic mono-or bicyclic ring system. The 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 160 of 174 

present invention is drawn to a narrow scope of pyrazole-N-2-
pyridinyl analogs, that is, J is limited to pyrazole substituted 
with a 2-pyridinyl ring. Further, U.S. Patent 6,747,047 allows 
for broad substitution (up to four broadly defined 
substituents) on the central anthranilamide phenyl ring and 
primarily teaches compounds with monosubstitution on this 
phenyl ring; although, the teachings are not limited to 
monosubstitution. U.S. Patent 6,747,047 does not teach any 
examples of the present invention, that is, wherein J is N-(2-
pyridinyl)-substituted pyrazole with disubstitution on the 
anthranilamide phenyl ring. Furthermore, in the present 
invention, disubstitution on the aruthranilamide phenyl ring is 
required and the positions are specifically defined. 

Insecticidal activity data from tests conducted by DuPont was 
extracted from DuPont's biological testing database for 
compounds of the present invention and compounds of U.S. 
Patent 6,747,047 that differ by only one substituent. This data 
is presented in the attached Appendix. The tables in the 
attached Appendix show the activity of compounds of the 
present invention and compares this activity with activity of 
compounds of U.S. Patent 6,747,047, which compounds 
differ in only one substituent, as can be determined by 
examining the structure above the table and column headings 
describing the relevant compounds. Compounds of the 
present invention are designated by their Compound number 
as found in lNDEX TABLE A at paragraph [0248] on pages 
32-33 of the present specification, as published, i.e. US 
2004/0198984 A1. Compounds of U.S. Patent 6,747,047 are 
designated by their Compound number as found in the 
INDEX of TABLE D in columns 163-167 of U.S. Patent 
6,747,047 or are identified by column number and their 
respective position in TABLE 9 of U.S. Patent 6,747,047. 

I consider the data in the Appendix to be particularly pertinent 
to a comparison of the control activity of compounds of the 
present application with compounds of U.S. Patent 6,747,047; 
and I conclude that the data in the Appendix conflrms that 
compounds of the present application provide superior (and 
unexpected) insecticidal activity over compounds in U.S. 
Patent 6,747,047."

The primacy required to be accorded to the evidence of the inventor of 

the patented invention stands underscored in para 47 of Bishwanath 

Prasad Radhey Shyam 10 , thus: 

"The learned trial Judge then noted that Purshottam, who was 
stated to be the inventor, and, as such, was the best person to 
describe the invention, did not appear in the witness-box, 
though, as admitted by Sotam Singh (D.W.3), Purshottam had 
attended on some dates of hearing. Sotam Singh tried to 
explain Purshottam's disappearance from the Court without 
appearing in the witness-box, by saying that he had gone 
away due to illness. The learned Judge found this explanation 
unsatisfactory and rejected it -and in our opinion rightly -
with the remark that recording of evidence lasted for several 
days and it was not difficult to secure Purshottam's 
attendance. Apart from being the best informed person about 
the matter in issue, Purshottam was not a stranger. He was a 
partner of the patentee firm and a brother of Sotam Singh 
(D.W.3). He was the best informed person who might have 
answered the charge of lack of novelty levelled by the 
opponent side, by explaining what was the novelty of the 
alleged invention and how and after what research, if any, he 
made this alleged 'discovery'. Being a partner of the 
respondent firm, and personally knowing all the 
circumstances of the case, it was his duty as well as of the 
respondent-firm, to examine him as a witness so that the story 
of the particular invention being a new manufacture or 
improvement involving novelty, could, in all its aspects, be 
subjected to cross examination. By keeping Purshottam away 
from the witness-box, the respondent-firm, therefore, took the 
heavy risk of the trial court accepting the charge of lack of 
novelty made by the appellant herein." 

The plea of want of additional efficacy of CTPR, over the subject 

matter of IN'978, therefore, is also prima facie devoid of merit. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 162 of 174 

15.4 The suit patent cannot, therefore, prima facie be regarded as 

vulnerable to invalidation under Section 64(1)(d) read with Section 

3(d) of the Patents Act. 

Resultantly 

16. As a result, the defendant has not been able to make out any 

prima facie case for treating the suit patent IN'307 as vulnerable to 

revocation or to invalidation. 

B. 
Re. IN'332 

17. IN'332 is the process patent, associated with IN'307. The title 

of IN'332 is "A Process for Preparing a Compound of Formula 1", 

where Formula 1 is the Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 of 

IN'307. IN'332 contains 22 Claims. Claim 1 discloses the process 

for preparing CTPR by reacting benzoxazinone (of Formula 2) with a 

C1-C4 alkyl amine or dimethyl amine. Claims 2 to 22 disclose the 

process steps for arriving at the reactants to be used in Claim 1. As 

such, IN'332 is restricted, entirely, to the process for manufacture of 

CTPR. This position is not disputed by Mr. Sai Deepak. 

18. Mr. Sai Deepak submits that (i) the plaint does not set out how 

IN'332 is being infringed by the defendants, (ii) as IN'307 is 

vulnerable, no protection can be extended to IN'332 either and (iii)

research activity is, in any event, protected by Sections 47 53 and 

107A 54 of the Patents Act. 

19. None of these contentions, unfortunately, impress. 

20. It cannot be said that the plaintiff has not asserted IN'332 in the 

plaint. Para-21 of the plaint reads thus: 

"Indian Patent No. 213332 is a valid and subsisting patent 
and has a term of 20 years from 13 th August, 2002 in India 
(i.e. till 13 th August, 2022). The aforesaid patent was neither 
a post in a pre-grant opposition nor in a post-grant opposition 
by any member of the public or interested party in India. By 
virtue of grant of the suit patent 213332, the Plaintiffs have 
the exclusive right to prevent any 3 rd party from the act of 
making, using, offering for sale, selling, exporting or 

53 "47. Grant of patents to be subject to certain conditions -

The grant of a patent under this Act shall be subject to the condition that -
(1) 
any machine, apparatus or other article in respect of which the patent is granted 
or any article made by using a process in respect of which the patent is granted, may be 
imported or made by or on behalf of the government for the purpose merely of its own 
use; 
(2) 
any process in respect of which the patent is granted may be used by or on 
behalf of the government for the purpose merely of its own use; 
(3) 
any machine, apparatus or other article in respect of which the patent is granted 
or any article made by the use of the process in respect of which the patent is granted, 
may be made or used, and any process in respect of which the patent is granted may be 
used, by any person, for the purpose merely of experiment or research including the 
imparting of instructions to pupils; and 
(4) 
in the case of a patent in respect of any medicine or drug, the medicine or drug 
may be imported by the Government for the purpose merely of its own use or for 
distribution in any dispensary, hospital or other medical institution maintained by or on 
behalf of the Government or any other dispensary, hospital or medical institution which 
the Central Government may, having regard to the public service that such dispensary, 
hospital or medical institution renders, specify in this behalf by notification in the Official 
Gazette." 

54 "107A. Certain acts not to be considered as infringement -

For the purposes of this Act, -
(a) 
any act of making, constructing, using, selling or importing the patented 
invention, solely for use as reasonably relating to the development and submission of 
information required under any law for the time being in force, in India, or in a country 
other than India, that regulates the manufacture, construction, use, sale or import of any 
product; 
(b) 
importation of patented products by any person from a person who is duly 
authorised under the law to produce and sell or distribute the product, 
shall not be considered as an infringement of patent rights." 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 164 of 174 

importing the subject matter of the suit patent up to 13 th 
August, 2022. It would be pertinent to note that counterparts 
of this patent had been granted in more than 40 countries and 
in none of these jurisdictions have the said patents been 
revoked or invalidated." 

Similarly, in para 35 of the plaint, the plaintiff has specifically alleged 

that the imminent commercial launch, by the defendant, of its CTPR 

product "would result in infringement of the suit patents IN 201307 

and IN 213332". Allegations, similar to these, are also contained in 

paras 45 and 46 of the plaint, of which the latter concludes with the 

assertion that "it is … reasonable to presume that the Defendant is 

either using or intends to use a process for manufacture of their CTPR 

product which infringes the suit patent IN'332." The submission of 

Mr. Sai Deepak that the plaintiff does not assert IN'332, or allege 

possible infringement thereof is, therefore, not correct. 

21. On merits, Mr. Sai Deepak submits, in the first instance, that, 

IN'307 being vulnerable, IN'332 is not entitled to protection. This 

submission, obviously, cannot sustain, in view of the findings, 

hereinbefore returned by me, that IN'307 is not vulnerable to 

revocation, and that no prima facie case of such vulnerability has been 

made out by the defendant. Secondly, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on 

Sections 47 and 107A. At a bare reading, these provisions do not 

apply, and the reliance thereon is merely a reliance of desperation, for 

the simple reason that protection is granted, by these provisions, only 

for use of the patented process "for the purpose merely of experiment 

or research". The plaintiff has sought protection of IN'332 to the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 165 of 174 

extent it is used in the manufacture of CTPR, and it is not the 

defendant's case that it is merely engaged in experiment or research. 

22. Once I have held that Claim 1 in IN'307/CTPR is entitled to 

protection, the challenge to its validity being prima facie devoid of 

merit, IN'332 also becomes, inexorably, also entitled to protection, 

being a process for manufacture of CTPR. 

23. It has been sought to be contended, by the defendants, that the 

process being used by them to manufacture their CTPR product is not 

the process which is patented in IN'332. Mr. Sethi, however, asserts 

that it is not open to the defendants to adopt this stance, as an 

application for discovery of the process used by the defendants to 

manufacture their CTPR product has been filed by the plaintiff and 

notice has been issued thereon but, despite more than a year having 

lapsed thereafter, the defendants have chosen not to respond to the 

application. As such, he submits, the Court would be entitled to 

presume that the process being adopted by the defendants is the 

process which stands patented in favour of the plaintiff in IN'332. 

24. To my mind, this controversy is really tangential to the issue of 

interim injunction. The plaintiff has only sought protection against 

infringement of IN'332. In case, the defendants are not using the 

process patented in favour of the plaintiff in IN'332, they would, 

naturally, be unaffected by the injunction sought by the plaintiff, 

insofar as protection of the process for manufacture of CTPR, claimed 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 166 of 174 

in IN'332, is concerned. If, on the other hand, the defendants are 

using the process claimed in IN'332, this order would apply to them. 

Conclusion 

25. As a result, the plaintiff is held entitled to protection from 

infringement in respect of both the suit patents IN'307 and IN'332. 

26. Pending disposal of the present suit, therefore, the defendant is 

restrained from 

(i) 
manufacturing, using, selling, distributing, advertising, 

exporting, offering for sale or in any other manner, directly or 

indirectly, dealing in any product which infringes the subject 

matter of IN 201307, including the product Chlorantraniliprole, 

claimed that disclosed therein, and 

(ii) using, directly or indirectly, any of the process as claimed 

in IN 213332, for the manufacture of Chlorantraniliprole, or the 

claimed subject matter of IN 201307. 

27. IA 15352/2019 stands allowed in the aforesaid terms. 

IA 2084/2021 in CS (Comm) 69/2021 [F.M.C. Corpn & Anr. v. Best 
Crop Science LLP & Anr.] 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 167 of 174 

28. I may note, at the very outset, that the order, dated 11 th 

February, 2021 passed in this application, records thus: 

"Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned counsel for the defendant, 
submits that the suit patent in the present case is the same as 
that which forms the subject matter of controversy in CS 
(Comm) 611/2019, the submissions on the application under 
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC would be 
substantially identical in both the cases. He undertakes on 
behalf of his client, to abide by the order passed on to be 
passed in IA 15352/2019 in CS (Comm) 611/2019, in which 
arguments have been heard in part, and learned counsel for 
the plaintiff is presently in rejoinder. That matter is listed for 
hearing on 15 th February, 2021." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

In view of the statement, made by learned Counsel for the defendant 

in this suit/application, it is obviously not permissible for the 

defendant to sail in a boat different from that in which the defendants 

in CS (Comm) 611/2019 cast oar. Nonetheless, the defendant in the 

present case has advanced detailed arguments, initially through Mr. 

Sai Deepak and, later, through Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned 

Senior Counsel, assisted by Mr. Saikrishna Rajagopal, learned 

Counsel. Separate written submissions have also been filed by the 

defendant in the present application. For ease of reference, the 

defendant in this case would be denoted, thereafter, as "BCS". 

29. BCS has, in its written submission (to which Mr. Subramanium 

specifically alludes), provided a "chart", "to show coverage and prior 

claiming of IN'307 patent (species patent) in claim 22 of IN'978 

patent", which constitutes Annexure 1 to this judgement. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 168 of 174 

30. A bare glance at said chart demonstrates, as has already been 

noticed hereinabove, that BCS has "cherry picked" substituents, out of 

the substitutions envisaged in the disclosure in Claim 22 of IN'978, 

for A, B, J, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4a , R 4b and R 5 . Even within the "J" 

substituent, BCS has cherry-picked a "suitable" substituent for R 7 . No 

justification for selecting the substituents in question is forthcoming in 

the submissions advanced by BCS, except the intent of "reaching" 

CTPR. Thus viewed, CTPR cannot be regarded as "obvious" from, or 

"taught by" IN'978. 

31. BCS has also sought to discredit the affidavit of Mr. Lahm. 

The plaintiff relied on the said affidavit both for the submission that 

proceeding from IN'978 to Claim 1 in IN'307 involved "inventive 

steps" as well as for the submission that CTPR possessed additional 

efficacy, over the compounds claimed in IN'978. The written 

submissions of BCS, even while acknowledging the contents of the 

affidavit of Mr. Lahm regarding the inventive steps involved in 

synthesising CTPR from the Markush moiety forming subject matter 

of Claim 22 in IN'978, contains no submissions on the basis of which 

the assertions of the affidavit of Mr Lahm could be discredited. In 

this regard, the written submission of BCS merely states thus: 

"Plaint and declaration of Plaintiff's expert Mr. George Lahm 
claims that novelty an inventive step resides in the following 
part of the Markush structure of Formula 1 of claim 1 of 
IN'307 patent: 
" 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 169 of 174 

Having thus noted the observations of Mr. Lahm regarding the 

inventive steps involved in arriving at Claim 1 of IN'307, BCS does 

not furnish any reason or justification for rejecting the affidavit of Mr. 

Lahm on this aspect. The reservations, expressed by BCS to the 

affidavit of Mr. Lahm, are restricted to the issue of additional efficacy 

of CTPR over the subject matter of IN'978. Presumably, therefore, 

BCS acknowledges the existence of inventive steps, in proceeding 

from Claim 22 in IN'978 to Claim 1 in IN'307. Even otherwise, I 

have, by comparing the two claims, found, on facts, that such 

inventive steps do, prima facie, exist. 

32. When this application was heard in part, BCS sought to 

introduce an affidavit of Mr Ajit Singh Gujral, who, in turn, sought to 

discredit the declaration of Mr. Lahm. I have already noted, 

hereinabove, that the evidence of the inventor of the invention has 

been accorded additional credibility, even by the Supreme Court. Any 

further examination of the comparative declarations of Mr. Lahm and 

affidavit of Mr. Gujral has, necessarily, to await trial. At this stage, in 

the face of the declaration of Mr. Lahm, I am unwilling to treat the 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 170 of 174 

affidavit of Mr. Gujral, filed belatedly and in the midst of hearing, as 

rendering the suit patent vulnerable. 

33. The written submission of BCS further contends that 

"Plaintiffs' alleged inventive step ... wherein chemical structure has 

N -(2 -pyridinyl)-substituted pyrazole which disubstitution on the 

anthranilamide phenyl ring is also claimed on disclosed in compounds 

of Plaintiffs' own earlier document WO'978 and in particular, 

WO'115." This, it is stated, stands explained in paras 58 to 75 of the 

reply, filed by BCS, to IA 2084/2021. Presumably, by this averment, 

BCS is seeking to assert vulnerability, of Claim 1 in IN'307 on the 

ground of "anticipation by prior publication". 

34. I have already noted, earlier in this order, that "anticipation by 

prior publication" can be alleged only where the claim of the specie 

patent is expressly published in the alleged genus patent. BCS has 

alleged "disclosure" of CTPR in WO'115. The parameters of the 

concept of "disclosure" have already been examined and explained 

hereinabove. Within the said parameters, I am unable to convince 

myself that the averments contained in paras 58 to 75 of the reply 

filed by BCS to the present application, indicate disclosure of CTPR, 

or of Claim 1 in IN'307, in WO'115. 

35. What is claimed, in WO'115, and which, according to BCS, 

"discloses compounds of Formula I", is the following: 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 171 of 174 

36. BCS asserts, in its reply to the present application, that 

"Cyclicized version of CTPR is derived from Markush structure of 

claim 1 of WO'115 when the following substitutions are made". 

Thereafter, the reply proceeds to cherry-pick substituents, out of the 

suggested substituents in Claim 1 of WO'115. Even after such 

cherry-picking, BCS arrives, not at CTPR, but, allegedly, at "a 

derivative of Chlorantraniliprole/CTPR in which the ring closure has 

been done in the other direction". Thereafter, the reply proceeds to set 

out, in detail, "the generic strategy of ring closure", resulting in 

synthesis of an "open ring compound". It is not the contention of the 

BCS, in the reply, that this "open ring compound" is CTPR. Reliance 

has also been placed, in the reply, to the declaration, in WO'115 that 

"by the procedures described herein together with methods known in 

the art, the following compounds of Tables 1 to 33 can be prepared". 

Proceeding therefrom, the reply asserts that "Example 2 in Pages 41-

43 of WO'115 discloses the preparation of one of the structurally 

closest molecules, i.e., 6 -chloro -2 -[-1 -(3 -chloro -2 -

pyridinyll) -3 -(trifluoromethyl) -1H -pyroazol -5 -yl] -3,S -

dimethyl -4 (3H) -quinazoline". 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 172 of 174 

37. All these submissions, even seen in conjunction, do not make 

out a case of disclosure of CTPR in WO'115. This, in fact, has been 

acknowledged, albeit by a side wind, in para 71 of the reply, of BCS, 

to the present application, which reads thus: 

"Thus, in view of the above, WO'115/US'614 invariably and 
unequivocally anticipates Chlorantraniliprole as well as its 
precursor -the Benzoxazinone key intermediate, claimed in 
IN'307 patent." 

38. It is not necessary, at this interlocutory stage, to analyse, 

further, the involved process by which, by effecting select 

substitutions on the claims in WO'115, BCS asserts that it has arrived 

at "key intermediates" for CTPR. One may just reproduce, in this 

regard, the diagrammatic representation of the manner in which such 

"disclosure" is alleged, by BCS, to have taken place in WO'115, as 

contained in the written submissions filed by BCS, thus: 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 173 of 174 

39. Thus, even on a comprehensive reading of the said assertions in 

the pleadings of BCS, it is not possible to hold that CTPR was 

disclosed in WO'115, or that its validity has been rendered vulnerable 

as a result thereof. 

40. Other submissions, advanced by BCS, have already been dealt 

with hereinabove. BCS has sought to contend that denial of 

injunction to the plaintiff would not result in irreparable loss to it, as it 

could be compensated in damages and that public interest is in favour 

of denial of injunction, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

These are, obviously, merely "residuary" submissions. Without citing 

judicial authorities in this regard, it is well settled that, in intellectual 

property infringement cases, especially in patent infringement claims 

and, most specifically, where the infringement case of a 

pharmaceutical/agrochemical patent, public interest dictates injuncting 

perpetuation of an invention which is, prima facie, infringing in 

nature. Damages, it is well settled, are no panacea in such a case. 

41. BCS does not dispute the fact that it seeks to exploit the claim 

in IN'307. As with the defendant in CS (Comm) 611/2019, BCS, too, 

seeks to assail the validity of IN'307 as a ground to justify such 

exploitation. For the reasons cited hereinabove, no prima facie case 

can be said to exist, in the said challenge. The inexorable sequitur is 

that the proposed exploitation deserves to be injuncted. 


CS(COMM) 69/2021 & CS(COMM) 611/2019 

Page 174 of 174 

42. For this reason, IA 2084/2021 also succeeds and is allowed, in 

terms of the directions issued, hereinabove, in IA 15352/2019 in CS 

(Comm) 611/2019 which apply, mutatis mutandis, to the present 

application as well. 

43. As the Court is presently functioning on a virtual mode, and it 

is not possible to furnish a physical copy of this judgement to the 

parties, the judgement would take effect from the time of its uploading 

on the website of this Court or from the time it is emailed to learned 

Counsel for the parties, whichever is earlier. The Registry is directed 

to email a copy of this judgement to learned Counsel for the parties as 

expeditiously as possible.
