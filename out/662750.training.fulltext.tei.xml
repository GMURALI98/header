			<p>The plaint averment in brief:-<lb/>Mr.M.Balaji, the plaintiff herein is a businessman in real estate since<lb/> 2004. He had entered into agreement with land owners in and around<lb/> Bangalore advancing money to them. The first defendant a businessman<lb/> dealing with leather products at Chennai in the name of M/s.JAY AR<lb/> Enterprises, a partnership firm approached the plaintiff expressing his<lb/> interest in purchasing those properties. On 09.09.2004, the first defendant<lb/> purchased 50% interest in three acres of land in S.No.1, Giddanahalli<lb/> Village, Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District through the plaintiff and<lb/> gained his trust. Subsequently, the first defendant expressed his interest to<lb/> purchase 5 acres 22 ½ guntas of agricultural land in Bidaraguppe Village at<lb/> Sarjapur Main Road, Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District, in which, the<lb/> plaintiff had already acquired interest. The sale price for the said land was<lb/> finalised @ Rs.46 lakhs per acre with condition that the plaintiff should get<lb/> permission for converting the usage of the said land from agricultural to non<lb/> agricultural purpose. The plaintiff spent huge money for the said conversion<lb/> and also spent heavily on settling the Court dispute among the land owners.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.Thereafter, the plaintiff arranged for the sale deeds being executed<lb/> directly in the name of the first defendant. The plaintiff believing the first<lb/> defendant paid the sale consideration to the land owners from out of his<lb/> personal fund. The plaintiff by issuing post dated cheques got three sale<lb/> deeds dated 19.03.2005 and one sale deed dated 11.04.2005 registered in<lb/> the name of the first defendant directly. Based on the resolution passed by<lb/> the second defendant firm cheque of the partnership firm was issued by the<lb/> first defendant to purchase the above said land in his personal name. In the<lb/> said transaction, the first defendant is liable to pay Rs.2,56,00,000/-<lb/>whereas, he paid only a sum of Rs.1,77,00,000/-and the balance sum of<lb/> Rs.79,00,000/-was due and payable by the plaintiff.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.The entire transaction on behalf of the first defendant was done<lb/> through his Power Agent Krishnamurthy. When the plaintiff demanded the<lb/> balance of Rs.79,00,000/-, Krishnamurthy the Power Agent of the first<lb/> defendant executed a letter of acknowledgment dated 15.04.2006 in favour<lb/> of the plaintiff. Subsequently, the first defendant issued a cheque from the<lb/> Bank account maintained by the second defendant for a sum of<lb/> Rs.79,00,000/-dated 30.10.2007 drawn on ABN AMRO Bank, Haddows Road<lb/> Branch, Chennai. On 15.04.2008, the plaintiff presented the cheque for<lb/> collection. The same was dishonoured with endorsement &quot;Insufficient fund&quot;.<lb/> Notice was issued to the first defendant calling upon him to pay the dues<lb/> covered under the said cheque. Denying the liability, the first defendant sent<lb/> a reply dated 30.05.2008. Therefore, the plaintiff has initiated proceedings<lb/> under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act to prosecute the first<lb/> defendant before the XVI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,<lb/> Bangalore, in C.C.No.19342 of 2008 and the same is pending.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.Thus, the plaintiff is entitle to receive a sum of Rs 79,00,000/-with<lb/> interest at the rate of 18% pa. Hence the suit for recovery of Rs<lb/> 1,21,66,000/-with interest at the rate of 18% from the date of suit till the<lb/> date of recovery on the principle sum of Rs. 79,00,000/-.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.The Written statement averment in brief:-<lb/></p>

			<p>The defendants deny the plaint averments in toto. According to them,<lb/> the suit claim is barred by limitation since, the alleged cause of action took<lb/> place between 19.03.2005 and 11.04.2005. The cheque dated 30.10.2007<lb/> is not a fresh promise to pay a time barred debt and it will not give a<lb/> supporting point for limitation. V.Krishnamurthy who was the erstwhile<lb/> Power Agent and employee under the first defendant has stolen the cheque<lb/> leaf from the first defendant. On the criminal complaint initiated against the<lb/> plaintiff and Krishnamurthy before Central Crime Branch, Chennai, they were<lb/> arrested and remanded to judicial custody. The said criminal case is pending<lb/> before the Judicial Magistrate, Poonamallee. Further, the defendants had<lb/> already instituted suit before the Civil Court at Tirupathi against<lb/> Krishnamurthy and the plaintiff for surreptitiously withdrawing the<lb/> defendants&apos; money for purchase of property at Tirupathi in the name of the<lb/> plaintiff. The alleged letter of acknowledgment dated 15.04.2006 executed<lb/> by Krishnamurthy cannot be the basis for any claim against the defendants<lb/> in the absence of any proof of money payable by the defendants.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.The criminal case initiated under the Negotiable Instruments Act<lb/> against the first defendant though initially ended in conviction before the trial<lb/> court, the judgment of the trial Court was later reversed in the appeal by the<lb/> Appellate Court and therefore, there is no enforceable debt against the<lb/> defendants. The plaintiff along with Krishnamurthy who is the estranged<lb/> employee of the first defendant had illegally withdrawn lakhs of rupees from<lb/> the first defendant. There is no document to show that the plaintiff had<lb/> interest in 5 acres 22 ½ guntas of agriculture land in Bidaraguppe Village at<lb/> Sarjapur Main Road, Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District and he spent<lb/> heavily towards conversion of the said agricultural land into non agricultural<lb/> land. Further, the allegation of fixing the price of the land @ 46 lakhs per<lb/> acre is not true. The claim of the plaintiff is false and is not entitled for any<lb/> interest as claimed.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.Based on the above averments, the following issues were framed by<lb/> this Court on 18.09.2014:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;1.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover a sum<lb/> of Rs.1,21,66,000/-from the defendants along with<lb/> interest at 18% p.a on the principal sum of<lb/> Rs.79,00,000/-from the date of plaint ?<lb/></item>

			<item>2.Whether the suit claim is sustainable on<lb/> speculation as the plaintiff is a speculator and middle man<lb/> in real estate business ?<lb/></item>

			<item>3.Whether the suit is barred by limitation ?<lb/></item>

			<item>4.Whether the suit is bad for mis-joinder of<lb/> parties ?<lb/></item>

			<item>5.Whether the dishonoured cheque will give raise to<lb/> a cause of action without any specific promise to pay a<lb/> time barred debt under Section 25 (3) of Indian Contract<lb/> Act ?<lb/></item>

			<item>6.Whether the suit claim is sustainable in view of<lb/> the provision of Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments<lb/> Act and whether the presumption contemplated under<lb/> section 139 is sufficient to prove the claim in the suit<lb/> without any acceptable evidence to show that the<lb/> defendants owe the suit claim to the plaintiff ?<lb/></item>

			<item>7.Whether the claim of the plaintiff is proved<lb/> beyond reasonable doubt in the absence of any legally<lb/> enforceable claim to sustain in the suit ?<lb/></item>

			<item>8.To what other reliefs, the parties are entitled to?&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>8.To substantiate their respective claim, the plaintiff and the<lb/> defendants have examined one witness each. On behalf of the plaintiff, 69<lb/> documents were marked as Exs.P.1 to P.69. On behalf of the defendants, 21<lb/> documents were marked as Exs.D.1 to D.21.<lb/></p>

			<p>9.The plaintiff, M.Balaji was examined as P.W.1. According to him, the<lb/> first defendant is the partner of second defendant firm. Defendants 3 and 4<lb/> are the other partners. The first defendant approached him for purchase of<lb/> interest and right by entering into agreement with the land owners. Though<lb/> initially, he was not interested to the proposal of the first defendant to sell<lb/> the lands to the defendant later, agreed for it, on the specific understanding<lb/> that the plaintiff will be paid Rs.46 lakhs per acre. Accordingly, he acted<lb/> upon investing his money by advancing sale consideration and for other<lb/> expenses to get conversion of land usage, settle the litigation between the<lb/> land owners. He facilitated the first defendant to purchase of the properties<lb/> and get it registered in the name of the first defendant directly.<lb/></p>

			<p>10.According to the plaintiff, he entered into a sale agreement with<lb/> one B.Chennakesava on 05.11.2004 who is the absolute owner of 7 ½<lb/> guntas of land situated at Bidaraguppe Village at Sarjapur Main Road,<lb/> Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District. In the said agreement,<lb/> B.Chennakesava for himself and on behalf of the adjoining land owners<lb/> falling under S.Nos.269, 270 and 279 at Bidaraguppe Village at Sarjapur<lb/> Main Road, Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District agreed to sell the land @<lb/> Rs.41 lakhs per acre and executed the sale agreement marked as Ex P-3. In<lb/> the said agreement for sale between the plaintiff and B.Chennakesava, the<lb/> parties have agreed for transfer of 5 acres 22 ½ guntas land for a sale<lb/> consideration of Rs 41 lakhs per acre. The plaintiff has advanced a sum of<lb/> Rs.1,00,000/-to B.Chennakesava. The plaintiff contends that he invested his<lb/> money for conversion of the said land into non agricultural land and to settle<lb/> the dispute between the land owners. He arranged for execution of the sale<lb/> deeds by the respective land owners directly in the name of the first<lb/> defendant showing the guide line value of the properties which was far below<lb/> the agreed value. The land owners accordingly, executed four sale deeds<lb/> which were marked as Exs.P.5 to P.8 respectively. The sale consideration<lb/> agreed by the first defendant for the said land was Rs.2,56,00,000/-<lb/>whereas, he paid only Rs.1,77,00,000/-. For the balance sum of<lb/> Rs.79,00,000/-one Krishnamurthy the Power Agent of the first defendant<lb/> gave an acknowledgment letter dated 15.04.2006 (Ex.P.10). Later, the first<lb/> defendant gave the cheque dated 17.03.2007 drawn in the name of the<lb/> account of the second defendant, for a sum of Rs.79,00,000/-(Ex.P.11).<lb/> When the said cheque was presented for collection, it was returned for want<lb/> of sufficient fund. Criminal case was initiated for dishonouring the cheque<lb/> after issuing notice. The legal notice issued by the plaintiff is marked as<lb/> Ex.P.13 and the reply of the defendants is marked as Ex.P.14.<lb/></p>

			<p>11.The criminal case initiated for dishonouring of cheque ended in<lb/> conviction on 16.06.2009 and the order copy is marked as Ex.P.16. The<lb/> bank statements of the plaintiff between 01/04/2004 and 01/07/2005 to<lb/> show that he has paid money to some of the land owners namely<lb/> Sriramaiah, Narayanappa and Gangadaran is Ex.P.17. The statement of<lb/> accounts for the period 10/12/2004 to 15/04/2005 to show payments made<lb/> by the plaintiff to the land owners Chennakesava, Naryaanappa and<lb/> Sriramaiah and to the Sub-Registrar, Anekal is marked as Ex P-42. These<lb/> documents were relied to prove that the plaintiff was involved in the land<lb/> purchased in the name of the first defendant through his power agent<lb/> Krishnamurthy and he has financially contributed for the transaction.<lb/></p>

			<p>12.To prove that in the earlier transaction in respect of the property<lb/> at Giddanahalli village in which the first defendant purchased the land on<lb/> 09/09/2004 and after converting into plots sold it for huge profit to third<lb/> parties, the plaintiff relies on the sale deeds Exs.P-18, P-19, P-20 and P-21,<lb/> to prove that the first defendant has taken inconsistent stand about the<lb/> authroisation given by him to his power agent Krishnamurthy and the<lb/> entrustment of signed cheques to him, the plaintiff relies on Ex P-22 and Ex<lb/> P 23.<lb/></p>

			<p>13.The copy of the FIR dated 20/08/2007 given by the first defendant<lb/> against his power agent Krishnamurthy and the plaintiff is Ex P-22. In this<lb/> complaint the first defendant has alleged that Kirshnamurthy along with<lb/> Balaji ( Plaintiff ) had cheated him to the tune of Rs. 1.70 crores by<lb/> misleading him that they have purchased land at Kanakapura, Bangalore for<lb/> Rs 65 lakhs in the name of the firsr defendant,but actually they did not<lb/> pruchased any land at Kanakapura. The first defendant has also alleged that<lb/> the plaintiff and Krishnamurthy had taken away Rs 2,56,00,000/-from him<lb/> for the purchase of the properties at Sharjapur Road registered in his him,<lb/> whereas on verification from the vendors he came to know that the they<lb/> were paid only Rs. 1,50,00,000/-.<lb/></p>

			<p>14.The plaintiff relies on this document to show that the first<lb/> defendant has admitted in his complaint that the said Krishnamurthy is the<lb/> working partner in KVL Associates, Chennai which is the sister concern of the<lb/> second defendant firm. Further krishnomurthy was authorised by the first<lb/> defendant to negotiate with the parties for purchase of property and he has<lb/> executed a power of attorney deed in his favour for that purpose.<lb/></p>

			<p>15.The stop payment letter given by the first defendant is marked as<lb/> Ex P:-23. In this letter the first defendant informed ABN AMRO Bank,<lb/> Nugambakkam Branch that 8 of his signed cheques are missing from his<lb/> office. To avoid misuse of the cheques he instruct the bank to stop payment.<lb/> The Cheque bearing No. 401681 ( Ex P-11) is not one among the 8 cheques<lb/> referred in this letter dated 14/07/2008.<lb/></p>

			<p>16.The counsel for the plaintiff pointing out that Ex P-11 cheque<lb/> bearing No. 401681 dated 30/10/2007 was presented for collection by the<lb/> plaintiff on 15/4/2008. The said cheque was returned by the banker with the<lb/> memo Ex P-12 intimating that the cheque is returned unpaid for funds<lb/> insufficiency. Therefore the plaintiff caused legal notice (Ex P-13) to the first<lb/> defendant on 14/05/2008. The defendant in his reply Ex P-14 has stated<lb/> that the plaintiff and Krishnamurthy were his agents for purchase of lands in<lb/> Bangalore and sell it to third parties for higher value after some period. In<lb/> the course of the said dealing, he being a frequent traveller abroad, gave<lb/> signed 20 cheque leaves bearing Numbers 401071 to 401090 to the Plaintiff<lb/> and Krishnamurthy to withdrew money from the second defendant firm<lb/> account for effecting payment to the land owners. In the criminal complaint<lb/> given to the Central Crime Branch on 20/08/2007 against the plaintiff and<lb/> Krishnamurthy, the defendant has not wisphered about entrustment of<lb/> signed blank cheques to the plaintiff or to Krishnamurthy. In Ex P-23 dated<lb/> 14/07/2008, the letter intimating the banker to stop payment, the first<lb/> defendant has stated that the signed blank cheques are missing and to avoid<lb/> misuse payment should be stopped. The next day the first defendant has<lb/> given a complaint to the Commissioner of Police alleging that the plaintiff<lb/> ( BALAJI) and Krishnamurthy hatched conspiracy to misuse one of the blank<lb/> cheque bearing No. 401681 dated 30/10/2007 drawn on ABN AMRO BANK,<lb/> Chennai which was issued for purchase of land during the year 2004-2005,<lb/> filed it for Rs 79,00,000/-, presented the same and got it dishonoured. The<lb/> learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that having admitted the liablity<lb/> and issued cheque for Rs. 79,00,000/-just to deprive the plaintiff, the first<lb/> defendant has taken different and inconsistent stands at different point of<lb/> time only to be exposed of his falsehood.<lb/></p>

The said criminal complaint filed by the plaintiff ended in<lb/> conviction in C.C.19342/2008 on 18/11/2010 (judgment copy is marked as<lb/> Ex P-33). On Appeal before the Session Judge, Bangalore in C.A. 878/2010<lb/> the conviction was set aside on 21/07/2012. ( judgment copy is marked as<lb/> Ex P-67). The plaintiff aggrieved by the order of the appellate court has<lb/> preferred appeal before the High Court, Bangalore in Cri.Appeal No.<lb/> 1110/2012.( Appeal copy is marked as Ex P-61).<lb/></p>

			<p>18.The documents connected to the civil proceedings initiated by the<lb/> first defendant against Balaji (the plaintiff herein), Ravoori Swarnalatha w/o<lb/> Balaji and Krishnamurthy before the Additional District Judge, Tirupathi in<lb/> O.S 107/2007 is relied by the plaintiff and they are marked as exhibits P-29,<lb/> Ex P-34 to 40. The pith and substance of the said suit is that Balaji (the<lb/> plaintiff in this suit), his wife Ravoori Swarnalatha and krishnamurthy<lb/> misappropriated the money of the first defendant and purchase property at<lb/> Tirupathi, hence prayer to declare the properties purchased in the name of<lb/> the Balaji and his wife were from out of the amounts received from the<lb/> Perim Janarthan Rao ( the first defendant herein).<lb/></p>

			<p>20.The Andra Bank, Vidyapeetha Circle Branch, Bangalore in which the<lb/> plaintiff maintains account had given the letter dated 08/09/2012 certifying<lb/> that the plaintiff had purchased 5 pay orders from his account as on<lb/> 13/03/2005 out of which 4 were purchased in favour of Sub-Registrar,<lb/> Anekal and one in favour of Sreeramulu. Later the plaintiff has cancelled one<lb/> pay order of Rs 2,25,600/-purchased in favour of Sub-Registrar, Anekal.<lb/> The plaintiff contention is that these are the investment he made on behalf<lb/> of the first defendant to purchase the lands covering the sale deeds Ex P-5<lb/> to P-8.<lb/></p>

			<p>21.The statement of bank accounts of the defendants in ABN Amro<lb/> Bank, Indian Bank and Indian Overseas Bank are marked as Ex P-47 to 52.<lb/> The statement of Bank Accounts of M/s Nimeesha Leathers Exports Ltd, M/s<lb/> KVL Associates the cheques issued by Krishnamurthy for KVL Associates for<lb/> purchase of demand drafts in the name of the vendors and cheques issued<lb/> by the 2 nd defendant are exhibits P-54 and P-55.<lb/></p>

			<p>22.To show that after purchase of the properties under sale deeds Ex<lb/> P-5 to Ex P-8 the his power agent Krishnamurthy, the first defendant has<lb/> appointed one Sri Rama Bala Subba Rayudu as his power agent on<lb/> 17/03/2007 under Ex P-57.<lb/></p>

			<p>23.The Sub Registrar has refixed the guideline value of the said<lb/> property after conversion and issued certificate of valuation and endorsment<lb/> on 21/03/2011. The plaintiff rely on this document marked as exhibit P-59<lb/> since the endorsement certificate is addressed to the plaintiff.<lb/></p>

			<p>24.The statement of account in respect of the 2 nd defendant firm<lb/> maintained at ABN Amro Bank, Chennai is Ex P-47. This document indicates<lb/> that the cheques bearing No. 401673 for Rs 9,50,000/-, Cheque No. 401676<lb/> for Rs 5,00,000/-and cheque No. 401683 for Rs 5,00,000/-were issued by<lb/> the 2 nd defendant in favour of the plaintiff and same were encashed by the<lb/> plaintiff.<lb/></p>

			<p>25.The learned counsel for the plaintiff referring the above documents<lb/> and explaining the purpose for which those documents are relied, submitted<lb/> that there can be no doubt about the facts that the first defendant is one of<lb/> the partners of the second defendant firm, the second respondent firm has<lb/> resolved to utilise the funds of the firm to purchase lands in the name of the<lb/> first defendant, the cheques of the second defendant firm were used for the<lb/> purchase of the lands at Bangalore.<lb/></p>

			<p>26.The first defendant though initially denied the status of<lb/> Krishnamurthy, admits in his complaint to police commissioner and in the<lb/> cross examination that Krishnamurthy was his authorised agent and only<lb/> through him the sale deeds Ex P-5 to P-8 were got registered. The recitals<lb/> in these Exhibits also<lb/> indicates that Krishnamurthy is the authorised<lb/> representative of the first defendant. While so, the acknowledgment letter<lb/> dated 15/04/2006 Ex P-10 given by Krishnamurthy binds the principal and<lb/> the first defendant cannot turn around and plead that the act of his agent<lb/> does not binds him.<lb/></p>

			<p>27.Pointing the portion of the DW-1 testimony where the first<lb/> defendant has admitted that he started the firm KVL Associates and he<lb/> appointed Krishnamurthy as the working partner of the said firm, the learned<lb/> counsel for the<lb/> plaintiff would submit that, this admission positively<lb/> disproves the claim of the defendants that the acknowledgment letter Ex P-<lb/>10 admitting liablity of Rs 79,00,000/-and the cheque Ex P-11 for<lb/> Rs.79,00,000/-were documents created in collusion between the plaintiff<lb/> and the said Krishnamurthy. Therefore the learned counsel submits that<lb/> there is no reasonable ground to suspect Ex P-10 acknowledgment of debt<lb/> and issuance of cheque (Ex P-11) to discharge the debt.<lb/></p>

			<p>28.Regarding the criminal prosecution initiated under section 138 of NI<lb/> Act, the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the the present civil<lb/> suit for recovery of money has to be independently decided based on the<lb/> evidence and preponderance of probabilities. The finding of criminal court<lb/> not relevant for deciding the civil suit. The learned counsel relies on the<lb/> judgment of the Supreme court rendered in Seth Ramdayal Jat -vs-<lb/>Lakmi Prasad [2009(11) SCC 545] to add emphasis to his submission that<lb/> the civil proceedings cannot be determined on the basis of the judgment of<lb/> criminal court finding, except statement admitted by the parties which are<lb/> relevant subject to sections 21,23, 42 and 43 of the Indian Evidence Act,<lb/> 29.The learned counsel submit that it has to be reasonable presumed<lb/> that a person who was issuing the cheque admits his liability by issuing the<lb/> cheque irrespective of the fact whether the cheque is honoured or not. To<lb/> buttress this submission he relies upon the judgments:-<lb/></p>

			<item>1) Rajpathi Prasad -vs Kaushalya Kuer and others ( 1980 SCC<lb/> OnLine Pat 107) and<lb/></item>

			<p>2) Hindustan Apparel Industries -vs-Fair Deal Corporation, New<lb/> Delhi ( 2000 SCC Online Guj 177).<lb/> and submitted that apart from the letter of the agent Ex P-10, the<lb/> dishonoured<lb/> cheque<lb/> Ex<lb/> P-11<lb/> independently<lb/> constitutes<lb/> direct<lb/> acknowledgment of the debt by the defendant.<lb/></p>

			<p>30.Rebutting the submission of the defendants that the blank cheques<lb/> entrusted to Krishnamurthy for a different purpose was misused by him in<lb/> collusion with the plaintiff, the learned counsel submit that, the cheque Ex P-<lb/>11 admittedly bears the signature of the first defendant. It is admitted by<lb/> the first defendant in the connected proceedings that blank signed cheques<lb/> was entrusted by him to Krishnamurthy to pay the sale consideration, broker<lb/> commission, registration charges and other incidental expenses. The recital<lb/> in Ex P-69 the power of attorney deed dated 14/03/2005 executed by the<lb/> first defendant in favour of the said Krishnamurthy empowers the agent to<lb/> appear before the Sub-Registrar , Anekal for the presentation of deeds that<lb/> would be executed by the owners of the aforesaid lands. The bank account<lb/> statements and the letter of the Andra Bank which are marked as Ex P-42,<lb/> Ex P-43 and Ex P-44 clearly proves that the part sale consideration to the<lb/> vendors and registration charges were paid by the plaintiff from his bank<lb/> account. Even assuming only blank cheque was given by the first defendant<lb/> it would attract the presumption under section 139 of the Negotiable<lb/> Instruments Act, in case if the defendant fails to prove that the cheque was<lb/> not issued to discharge of a debt.<lb/></p>

			<p>31.The learned counsel for the plaintiff would state that, the<lb/> defendants have not rebutted the said statutory presumption, contrarily, the<lb/> plaintiff through the above mentioned documents have established there was<lb/> financial transaction between the plaintiff and the defendants and the<lb/> plaintiff has contributed his service and money for completion of the<lb/> transactions pertaining to the land purchased under Ex P-5 to P-8.<lb/></p>

			<p>32.Relying upon Bir Singh -vs-Mukesh Kumar [2019(4) SCC 197]<lb/> the counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there is strong presumption<lb/> against the defendants which has not been rebutted. Except a bald denial of<lb/> debt and fake allegation of misuse of cheque by his agent in collusion with<lb/> the plaintiff, there is no cogent evidence that there was no debt or liability.<lb/> Hence suit to be allowed.<lb/></p>

			<p>33.In defence, the first defendant has mounted the witness box. 21<lb/> documents are marked as defence side exhibits. Ex D-1 to D-5 are civil<lb/> proceedings for recovery money initiated against the plaintiff and others by<lb/> one Gottipatti Damodara Naidu. Ex D-6 and D-7 are the copy of the criminal<lb/> complaint under section 200 Cr.P.C and FIR copy filed by one Narra Jagadish<lb/> against the plaintiff and his wife before the Judicial Magistrate, Tirupathi.<lb/> These documents are relied by the defendants to show that the plaintiff is a<lb/> financier operating at Tirupathi and had involved in prize chit and money<lb/> circulation fraud. Ex D-8 is the letter of acknowledgment purported to have<lb/> been given by Krishnamurthy to the first defendant admitting the receipt of<lb/> Rs 3,20,45,826/-which is in tune with the auditor&apos;s report Ex P-46/-. Ex D-9<lb/> FIR in Cr.No. 470/ 2007 on the file of crime branch Chennai is duplication of<lb/> Ex P-22. Ex D-10 legal notice under section 138 of NI Act issued by the<lb/> plaintiff is duplication of Ex P-13. Ex D-11 reply notice of the defendants<lb/> counsel is duplication of Ex P-14. Ex D-12 complaint to Commissioner of<lb/> Police, Chennai given by the defendant is duplication of Ex P-24. Ex D-13<lb/> stop payment letter of the defendant is duplication of Ex P-23. Ex D-14 and<lb/> Ex D-15 are orders of the Madras High Court, granting bail to the plaintiff<lb/> and Krishnamurthy in Cr.No. 470/2007. Ex D-16 is the copy of the<lb/> application made by the first defendant before the JM-1, Poonamallee to<lb/> furnish copy of the accused statements ( Balaji and Krishnamurthy). Ex P-17<lb/> is replica of the complaint Ex D-12 and P-24. Ex D-18 is the final report filed<lb/> by CCB, Chennai in Cr.No. 470/2007. Ex D-19 is replica of Ex P-67. Ex D-20<lb/> is duplication of Ex P-8 and Ex D-21 is duplication of Ex P-30.<lb/></p>

			<p>34.The learned counsel for the defendant s relying upon the testimony<lb/> of the first defendant and the documents, contend that believing<lb/> Krishnamurthy, blank signed cheques were entrusted to negotiate with the<lb/> land owners for purchase of the land covered under Exs.P.5 to P.8. The<lb/> plaintiff who was the middleman for the said transaction has received his<lb/> remuneration. However he in connivance with the power agent<lb/> Krishnamurthy has overdrawn money from the 2 nd defendant&apos;s bank account<lb/> more and above what is payable to the vendors. For the said act of cheating<lb/> criminal complaint lodged with Commissioner of Police, Chennai against the<lb/> plaintiff and Krishnamurthy. On his complaint, Balaji and Krishnamurthy<lb/> were arrested and released on bail by order of the High Court Madras vide<lb/> Ex D-15 and D-16. Therefore in connivance with his estranged Power Agent,<lb/> Krishnamurthy the blank cheque Ex P-11 was filed up and presented for<lb/> collection.<lb/></p>

			<p>35.The plaintiff initiated private complaint under the Negotiable<lb/> Instruments Act in respect of the cheque issued in favour of the plaintiff for a<lb/> sum of Rs.79,00,000/-. The Judicial Magistrate convicted the defendant.<lb/> Later, the Principal City Civil Court and Sessions Judge Bangalore City vide<lb/> order dated 21.07.2012 in Criminal Appeal No.878 of 2010 (Ex.D.19) has set<lb/> aside the judgment and order of the trial Court dated 18.11.2010 convicting<lb/> the first defendant. The Learned Counsel for the Defendant further states<lb/> across the bar that the further appeal preferred by the plaintiff before the<lb/> High Court against the order of acquittal also dismissed by the High Court,<lb/> Bangalore.<lb/></p>

			<p>36.The prime contention of the learned counsel for the defendant is<lb/> that, there is no agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants to pay<lb/> Rs 46 lakhs per acre in respect of the property covered under the sale deeds<lb/> Ex P-5 to P-8. The plaintiff was duly paid for his services and nothing<lb/> payable to him. Contrarily the plaintiff and Krishnamurthy (since deceased)<lb/> has fraudulently encashed the blank signed cheques entrusted and facing<lb/> criminal prosecution. Though the criminal court finding does not bind the civil<lb/> proceedings, the admissions and statements made by the parties in the<lb/> criminal proceedings are relevant and admissible in evidence in the<lb/> subsequent proceedings. In those proceedings the plaintiff has admitted that<lb/> he has received more than 19,50,000/-from the defendants. He has also<lb/> admitted that there is no documentary evidence to show that he had prior<lb/> agreement with the land owners except Chennakesava who held only 7 ½<lb/> guntas of land.<lb/></p>

			<p>37.The Learned counsel for the defendant strongly relying upon<lb/> section 188 of the Indian Contract Act, submitted that the power of attorney<lb/> deed given in favour of Krishnamurthy never authorisied him to borrow<lb/> money or acknowledge debts. He was only authorised to carryout the<lb/> registration work. Therefore Ex P-10 alleged acknowledgment of debt letter<lb/> given by the agent without authorisation is invalid.<lb/></p>

			<p>38.On considering the rival submissions, this court finds that the<lb/> dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants primarily centres upon<lb/> Ex.P.10, the letter of acknowledgment alleged to have been given by<lb/> Krishnamurthy, the Power Agent of the first defendant. The content of the<lb/> said Exhibit (Ex.P.10) reads as below:-<lb/>&quot;Towards purchase of lands through M.Balaji at<lb/> Bidaraguppe Village at Sarjapur Main Road, Bangalore in<lb/> Sy.Nos.269, 270 and 273.<lb/> Extent of land 5 Acres and 22 ½ guntas at the rate<lb/> of Rs.46 lakhs per acre.<lb/> Total amount payable<lb/> Rs.2,56,00,000/-<lb/>Amount paid by way<lb/> of cheques, costs and DD&apos;s Rs.1,77,00,000/-<lb/>------------------<lb/></p>

			<item>15-04-2006&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>39.The specific case of the plaintiff is that, he had an understanding<lb/> with the land owners to sell 5 acres 22 ½ guntas at the rate of Rs 41 lakhs.<lb/> Knowing this the first defendant expressed his desire to buy those land for a<lb/> sale consideration @ Rs.46 lakhs per acre. To substantiate this contention<lb/> the plaintiff relies the recital in Ex.P.10 and Ex.P.3.<lb/></p>

			<p>40.However, the recital in Ex.P.3 would show that one<lb/> B.Chennakesava holding 7 ½ guntas of land has agreed to sell 5 acres of<lb/> land @ Rs.41 lakhs per acre in S.Nos.269, 270 and 279 at Bidaraguppe<lb/> Village at Sarjapur Main Road, Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District to the<lb/> plaintiff. In this document, Chennakesava<lb/> claims himself as the<lb/> representative of the owners of 5 acres 22 ½ guntas of land. The plaintiff<lb/> has not explained how this document could be relied upon for his contention<lb/> that he had interest in the entire 5 acres 22 ½ guntas of land situated at<lb/> S.Nos.269, 270 and 279 at Bidaraguppe Village at Sarjapur Main Road,<lb/> Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District when there is no document to link<lb/> B.Chennakesava and other owners of 5 acres 22 ½ guntas of land at<lb/> S.Nos.269, 270 and 279 at Bidaraguppe Village at Sarjapur Main Road,<lb/> Anekal Taluk, Bangalore Rural District. The lack of privity of contract with<lb/> other owners, renders a plaintiff case weak. Even assuming that the plaintiff<lb/> have some claim over the property which is covered under Exs.P.5 to P.8 by<lb/> virtue of Ex.P.3 agreement of sale, it is an agreement between the plaintiff<lb/> and one of the several owners who hold only 7 ½ guntas of land. How this<lb/> agreement of sale will bind the remaining owners holding more than 5 acres<lb/> of land is unexplained by the plaintiff. Further, the evidence available reveals<lb/> that the first defendant has purchased the property directly from the land<lb/> owners and got it registered including the portion of the land for which the<lb/> plaintiff had entered into agreement of sale with Chennakesava under<lb/> Ex.P-3. If at all the plaintiff wants to ascertain his right or interest, before or<lb/> the moment sale deeds executed and got registered in favour of the first<lb/> defendant he should have challenged the said transaction.<lb/></p>

			<p>41.Therefore, this Court holds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that<lb/> he had any interest or right in respect of properties covering Ex P-5 to P-8<lb/> and also the plaintiff has not proved that there was agreement between him<lb/> and the defendants to alienate the property at the rate of Rs 46 lakhs per<lb/> acre.<lb/></p>

			<p>42.The counsel for the plaintiff states that Ex in P-10 the agent of the<lb/> first respondent has acknowledged the existence of agreement and debt of<lb/> Rs 79,00,000/-. As pointed out by the learned counsel for the Defendant, to<lb/> acknowledge the debt, the agent should have authorisation. In the absence<lb/> of authorisation, the act of the agent will not bind the principal.<lb/></p>

			<p>42.Sections 186 to 188 of the Indian Contract Act, read as below:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;186. Agent&apos;s authority may be expressed or implied.-The authority of<lb/> an agent may be expressed or implied. 55<lb/> 187. Definitions of express and implied authority.-An authority is said<lb/> to be express when it is given by words spoken or written. An authority is<lb/> said to be implied when it is to be inferred from the circumstances of the<lb/> case; and things spoken or written, or the ordinary course of dealing,<lb/> may be accounted circumstances of the case. -An authority is said to be<lb/> express when it is given by words spoken or written. An authority is said<lb/> to be implied when it is to be inferred from the circumstances of the case;<lb/> and things spoken or written, or the ordinary course of dealing, may be<lb/> accounted circumstances of the case.&quot; Illustration A owns a shop in<lb/> Serampor, living himself in Calcutta, and visiting the shop occasionally.<lb/> The shop is managed by B, and he is in the habit of ordering goods from<lb/> C in the name of A for the purposes of the shop, and of paying for them<lb/> out of A&apos;s funds with A&apos;s knowledge. B has an implied authority from A<lb/> to order goods from C in the name of A for the purposes of the shop. A<lb/> owns a shop in Serampor, living himself in Calcutta, and visiting the<lb/> shop occasionally.

B has an implied<lb/> authority from A to order goods from C in the name of A for the purposes<lb/> of the shop.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>188. Extent of agent&apos;s authority.-An agent having an authority to do an<lb/> act has authority to do every lawful thing which is necessary in order to<lb/> do such act. -An agent having an authority to do an act has authority to<lb/> do every lawful thing which is necessary in order to do such act.&quot; An<lb/> agent having an authority to carry on a business, has authority to do<lb/> every lawful thing necessary for the purpose, or usually done in the<lb/> course, of conducting such business.

(b) A constitutes B his agent to<lb/> carry on his business of a ship-builder. B may purchase timber and other<lb/> materials, and hire workmen, for the purpose of carrying on the<lb/> business.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>In the light of these provisions, it is essential to see the recital of the general<lb/> power of attorney dated 14/03/2005 executed by the first defendant in<lb/> favour of the said Krishnamurthy which is marked as Ex P 69. The recital in<lb/> this deed speaks about the agreement already entered between the<lb/> defendant and the land owners in respect of 2 acres 35 guntas of land in<lb/> Survey No. 270 and 269 at Bidaragauppe Village. The defendant expressing<lb/> his inability to go over to Anekal has authorised Krishnamurthy to do all or<lb/> any of the following acts, deeds and things on behalf of Pertim Janarthana<lb/> Rao ( first defendant).<lb/></p>

			<item>1) To appear before the Sub-Registrar, Anekal for the<lb/> purpose of presentation of the sale deeds that<lb/> would be executed by the owners of the aforesaid<lb/> lands. To appear on my behalf before the sub-<lb/>Registrar for the purpose of registration of the sale<lb/> deeds in my name and on my behalf and to sign all<lb/> statutory application forms, to swear to affidavits or<lb/> such other documents or papers as may be required<lb/> and also to do such other acts, deeds and things<lb/> that may be required to be done for the effective<lb/> completion of registration of sale deeds in my<lb/> favour.<lb/></item>

			<item>2) To represent me before the Revenue Authorities for<lb/> the purpose of transfer of Khatha in respect of the<lb/> aforesaid lands in my name and for the said<lb/> purpose to sign applications, statutory forms, to<lb/> swear to affidavits. My lawful attorney shall have<lb/> powers to pay cess, tax and such other outgoings in<lb/> respect of the aforesaid lands on my behalf.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>44.The recital thus authorise Krishnamurthy only to do acts and deeds<lb/> relating to registration of the sale deeds and nothing more. While so, the<lb/> alleged acknowledgment of debt executed by Krishnmurthy on behalf of the<lb/> first defendant will not bind the defendants.<lb/></p>

			<p>45.In this context, it is also relevant to refer Sections 226, 227 and<lb/> 228 of the Indian Contracts Act which deals enforcement and consequences<lb/> of agent&apos;s contracts, and how far the act of agent exceeding his authority will<lb/> bind the principal.<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;226. Enforcement and consequences of agent&apos;s contracts.-<lb/>Contracts entered into through an agent, and obligations arising from<lb/> acts done by an agent, may be enforced in the same manner, and will<lb/> have the same legal consequences as if the contracts had been entered<lb/> into the acts done by the principal in person. -Contracts entered into<lb/> through an agent, and obligations arising from acts done by an agent,<lb/> may be enforced in the same manner, and will have the same legal<lb/> consequences as if the contracts had been entered into the acts done by<lb/> the principal in person.&quot; Illustrations<lb/></item>

(a) A<lb/> buys goods from B, knowing that he is an agent for their sale, but not<lb/> knowing who is the principal.

C is discharged of his obligation to pay the sum in question to<lb/> B.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>227. Principal how far bound, when agent exceeds authority.-When an<lb/> agent does more than he is authorized to do, and when the part of what<lb/> he does, which is within his authority, can be separated from the part<lb/> which is beyond his authority, so much only of what he does as is within<lb/> his authority is binding as between him and his principal. -When an<lb/> agent does more than he is authorized to do, and when the part of what<lb/> he does, which is within his authority, can be separated from the part<lb/> which is beyond his authority, so much only of what he does as is within<lb/> his authority is binding as between him and his principal.&quot; Illustration A,<lb/> being owner of a ship and cargo, authorizes B to procure an insurance<lb/> for 4,000 rupees on the ship.

A is bound<lb/> to pay the premium for the policy on the ship, but not the premium for the<lb/> policy on the cargo.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>228. Principal not bound when excess of agent&apos;s authority is not<lb/> separable.-Where an agent does more than he is authroized to do, and<lb/> what he does beyond the scope of his authority cannot be separated from<lb/> what is within it, the principal is not bound to recognize the transaction.<lb/> -Where an agent does more than he is authroized to do, and what he<lb/> does beyond the scope of his authority cannot be separated from what is<lb/> within it, the principal is not bound to recognize the transaction.&quot;<lb/></item>

A, authorizes B to buy 500 sheep for him. B buys 500 sheep<lb/> and 200 lambs for one sum of 6,000 rupees. A may repudiate the whole<lb/> transaction.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>46.It is seen that Ex P-10 letter given by Krishnamurthy the agent of<lb/> the first defendant is not within the authority and it is separable from the<lb/> acts authorised. Therefore, execution of the letter Ex P-10 as agent of first<lb/> defendant is an act in excess of the authorisation. This execution of this<lb/> letter does not fall within the acts authorised to do under Exhibit P-69.<lb/> Therefore, it is held that for want of authorisation, the first defendant who is<lb/> the principal is not bound by Ex P-10 executed by his agent.<lb/></p>

			<p>47.Dehors of Ex P-10, independently if other documents are analysed<lb/> for ascertaining the existence of liability, in the absence of the documents to<lb/> show that the plaintiff has incurred expenses in dealing with the property<lb/> and the first defendant agreed for a sale consideration of the properties at<lb/> the rate of Rs. 46 lakhs per acre the plaintiff averments stand in air without<lb/> any corroboration. Neither in the sale agreement ( Ex P-3) nor in sale deeds<lb/> marked as Ex.P.5 to P.8 the property is valued at Rs 46 lakhs per acre.<lb/></p>

			<p>48.It is the contention of the plaintiff that, though the market value of<lb/> the property was Rs 46 lakhs per acre, just for registration purpose, it was<lb/> undervalued. If that is so, it is for the land owners to speak about it and not<lb/> the plaintiff who has nothing to do with the property. Further, in Ex P-59, the<lb/> endorsement certificate issued by the Sub-Registrar, Anekal this Court finds<lb/> that the Government after conversion of the land use has fixed the market<lb/> value of the property at the rate of Rs.31,50,000/-. Therefore, even by<lb/> remote preponderance of probabilities, the case of the plaintiff could not be<lb/> accepted.<lb/></p>

			<p>49.This Court finds that except Exs.P-3, P-10 and P.11, all other<lb/> documents relied by the plaintiff is either documents relating to the criminal<lb/> proceedings initiated by either side or civil proceedings initiated by third<lb/> parties. The relevancy of these evidence are almost nil or very remote. The<lb/> materials available and culled out by the learned counsel for the plaintiff<lb/> proves that the parties are not strangers. There was money transactions<lb/> between them. Later, in view of the dispute cropped up, litigations at various<lb/> forum have been initiated. As for as the relief sought in this case, the<lb/> parallel criminal prosecution based on the cheque marked as Ex P-11 alone<lb/> is some relevancy. The said prosecution has ultimately ended in acquittal.<lb/> However, as fairly conceded by both the learned counsel on either side, the<lb/> finding of the Criminal Court has less binding effect on the civil proceedings.<lb/> Therefore, to arrive at a conclusion on the issues framed evidence has to<lb/> appreciated independently. For that purpose, essentially, 3 documents are to<lb/> be scrutinized. Those documents are Exs.P-3, P-10 and P-11.<lb/></p>

			<p>50.As pointed out earlier, Ex P-3 is an agreement for a miniscule<lb/> minuscule extent of land (7 ½ guntas ) with one owner and the property<lb/> under consideration is of vast extent of 5 acres and 22 ½ guntas. (About 40<lb/> guntas is equal to one acre) owned by several persons. The plaintiff has no<lb/> evidence to show he has any agreement with all the owners except one.<lb/></p>

			<p>51.Ex.P.10 is a letter given by Krishnamurthy, the Power Agent of the<lb/> first defendant. It is claimed to be letter acknowledging the debt. However,<lb/> when tested with the recital of power of attorney deed ( Ex P 69) &apos;whether<lb/> Krishnamurthy had authority to give such letter&apos;, it is found to be beyond his<lb/> authority. Under section 188 of the Indian Contract Act, an Agent can do an<lb/> act only to an extent which he is authorised explicitly or impliedly and not<lb/> beyond that.<lb/></p>

			<p>52.Ex.P.10, acknowledgment alleged to have been executed by<lb/> Krishnamurthy is dated 15.04.2006. This letter indicates that the first<lb/> defendant is liable to pay Rs.79,00,000/-towards purchase of land bought<lb/> through the plaintiff. If the statement found in the document is true, then<lb/> there must be some evidence that the plaintiff had entered into an<lb/> agreement with the other land owners holding the entire 5 acre 22 ½ guntas<lb/> of land whereas, the only document produced by the plaintiff is Ex.P.3, which<lb/> is in respect of 7 ½ guntas of land held by B.Chennakesava. When the<lb/> entire transfer of property got completed and sale deeds Exs.P-5 to P-8 got<lb/> registered between 19.03.2005 and 11.04.2005, the necessity to give the<lb/> letter Ex P-10 on 15/04/2006 is also left unexplained by the plaintiff.<lb/></p>

			<p>53.The learned counsel for the plaintiff relying upon the entries made<lb/> in the statement of bank accounts and the letter of the Andra Bank which<lb/> are marked as Exs.P-17; P-42; P-43 and P-44 would submit that the<lb/> plaintiff had paid money to the other land owners on the dates relevant to<lb/> the date of sale deeds and paid the necessary registration charges to the<lb/> Sub-registrar and the same is admitted by the first defendant.<lb/></p>

			<p>54.Merely by such entries and admission, the case of the plaintiff<lb/> cannot be held to be proved, when there are contra evidence let in by the<lb/> defendant that more than Rs.19 lakhs been paid to the plaintiff and the<lb/> plaintiff has not rendered accounts to the first defendant. The plaintiff in his<lb/> wisdom has thought fit not to examine the vendors to show that he had<lb/> some role in the transactions covered under Exs.P.5 to P.8. Neither he has<lb/> placed evidence to lend credence to his case that he has spent money for<lb/> conversion and to settle the litigation between the vendors. Therefore, by all<lb/> means, this case could be viewed only as a speculative litigation webbed out<lb/> of documents given in trust or held during the normal course of business<lb/> transaction. For the above reasons, issues No.1 and 2 are answered in<lb/> negative.<lb/></p>

			<p>55.Both the plaintiff as well as the defendants have multiple litigations<lb/> against each other. In each case, they have taken different stand. As far as<lb/> the present case is concerned, the plaintiff would rely upon Ex P.11 cheque<lb/> to prove the liability. No doubt, there shall be an initial presumption of<lb/> liability regarding the cheque, however, the said presumption is rebuttable.<lb/> The defendants can rebut the presumption by placing materials to show that<lb/> the cheque was not issued for the liability in the manner in which the plaintiff<lb/> has projected.<lb/></p>

			<p>56.The plaintiff to prove his entitlement of Rs.79,00,000/-would<lb/> heavily rely upon the sale agreement for 7 ½ guntas of land and the<lb/> acknowledgment letter of Krishnamurthy. The content of documents does<lb/> not correlates the parties, value of the property and liability mentioned in<lb/> the cheque Ex P-11. The claim of Rs.79,00,000/-for the transactions<lb/> covered under the sale deeds viz., Exs.P.5 to P.8 executed by the land<lb/> owners directly in the name of the first defendant either should be<lb/> established through impeccable documents or through independent reliable<lb/> oral evidence. In this case, the plaintiff has failed to state the exact date<lb/> the cheque was issued and from whom he received the cheque.<lb/></p>

			<p>57.Under section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act , unless<lb/> contrary is proved, it has to be presumed that it was issued on the date on<lb/> which it bear. Being a rebuttable presumption, it is the duty of the Court to<lb/> look whether the cheque would have been given on 30/10/2007. In this<lb/> context, Ex P-22 the criminal complaint before the Crime Branch, Chennai<lb/> on 30.08.2007, against the plaintiff and Krishnamurthy given by the first<lb/> defendant is relevant and requires consideration. This complaint was taken<lb/> on file for investigation in Crime No. 470/2007. In this complaint it is<lb/> specifically alleged that the plaintiff and Krishnamurthy has cheated the first<lb/> defendant to a tune of Rs.1.50 crores in connection with the land dealing.<lb/> While so, after lodging criminal complaint on 20/08/2007, the first defendant<lb/> could not have issued the cheque Ex P-11 in favour of the plaintiff on<lb/> 30.10.2007.<lb/></p>

			<p>58.In alternate, the probable date or month of issuance of this cheque<lb/> can be ascertained by verifying the dates on which the previous and<lb/> subsequent cheques were encashed. From Ex P-47 the ABN/AMRO bank<lb/> statement of account of the second respondent firm indicate that most of the<lb/> cheques bearing Numbers between 401673 and 401683 were encashed<lb/> between October 2004 and January 2005. Out of these cheques, the plaintiff<lb/> himself has encashed the following 4 cheques for total sum of Rs<lb/> 19,50,000/-:-<lb/></p>

			<item>1) 27/10/2004 -Cheque No. 401673 Rs. 9,50,000/-<lb/></item>

			<item>2) 13/12/2004 -Cheque No. 401676 Rs. 5,00,000/-<lb/></item>

			<item>3) 01/01/2004 -Cheque No. 401683 Rs. 5,00,000/-<lb/></item>

			<p>59.Therefore, by preponderance of probabilities, the defendants had<lb/> rebutted the presumptions under sections 118 and 139 of the Negotiable<lb/> Instruments Act, that the cheques were not issued on 30/10/2007 for any<lb/> debt or existing liability. After the rebuttal, the burden shifts on the plaintiff<lb/> to prove &apos;whether the cheque Ex P-11 was given to him by the first<lb/> defendant on 30/10/2007&apos; and &apos;whether the same was given for discharge of<lb/> liability&apos;. The evidence available does not prove the facts asserted by the<lb/> plaintiff. Therefore, there is no doubt in the mind of this Court that the case<lb/> of the plaintiff is a story concocted by making use of the cheque and letter<lb/> given by Krishnamurthy. Accordingly, the issues 6 and 7 are answered in<lb/> negative.<lb/></p>

			<p>60.The suit is laid before this Court on 25/10/2010 based on the<lb/> dishonoured cheque dated 30/10/2007 issued pursuant to the<lb/> acknowledgment of debt given by Krishnamurthy on 15/04/2006. As far as<lb/> the letter of acknowledgment Ex P-10, which is given by the agent and<lb/> already in the earlier part of this judgment it is held that the agent has given<lb/> this letter without authority. In so far as the Cheque Ex P-11 is concerned,<lb/> though it bears 30/10/2007 as date and under section 118 of the Negotiable<lb/> Instruments Act, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved the<lb/> negotiable instrument bearing a date was made or drawn on such date, this<lb/> point has been discussed above at length and held that the presumption<lb/> under section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act regarding the date has<lb/> been rebutted through the entries found in the 2 nd defendant&apos;s bank<lb/> statement of account marked as Ex P-47.<lb/></p>

			<p>61.Sub-section (3) of section 25 Indian Contracts Act deals with<lb/> acknowledgment time barred debt. According to Pollock and Mulla ( The<lb/> Indian Contract Act and Specific Relief Act -14 th Edition, Lexis Nexis -<lb/>Butterworths Wadhwa), in order to invoke the provisions of Section 25(3) of<lb/> the Indian Contracts Act, the following conditions must be satisfied:-<lb/></p>

			<item>1. It must be referred to a debt which the creditor but for the period of<lb/> limitation, might have enforced;<lb/></item>

			<item>2. There must be a distinct promise to pay wholly or in part such debt<lb/> and<lb/></item>

			<item>3. The promise must be in writing signed by the person or by his duly<lb/> appointed agent.<lb/></item>

			<p>62.Therefore, a promise to pay a time-barred debt is a condition<lb/> precedent for application of Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act. The<lb/> said promise must be express and unequivocal. Now, when we read the<lb/> content of the letter -Ex P-10 given by Krishnamurthy as general power of<lb/> Attorney holder of the first defendant, leave alone the authority to give such<lb/> letter, we find that the promise to pay is conspicuously absent in this letter.<lb/> Assuming the letter acknowledging the debt is valid and given prior to the<lb/> expiry of limitation, it is highly improbable to say the cheque -Ex P-11 was<lb/> issued on 30/10/2007. Undoubtedly, it should have been left the possession<lb/> of the defendants and come to the possession of the plaintiff prior to<lb/> 20/08/2007, the date on which the first defendant gave complaint to the<lb/> Commissioner of Police, Chennai alleging fraud and cheating.<lb/></p>

			<p>63.However, the cheque being dishonoured, one of the issue framed in<lb/> this case is &apos;whether a dishonoured cheque will save the limitation of time<lb/> barred debt, in the absence of promise&apos;. This issue is a significant question<lb/> of law, though may not have serious bearing on the case in hand, even if<lb/> held either way.<lb/></p>

			<p>64.Cheque is defined under section 4 of the Negotiable Instruments<lb/> Act as a &apos;bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to<lb/> be payable otherwise than on demand&apos;. Cheque is therefore a negotiable<lb/> instrument carrying the promise implicitly, unlike a pro-note where the<lb/> promise is explicit and mandatory. Therefore, limitation has to be reckoned<lb/> from the the date the cheque and not on the fact &apos;whether the cheque was<lb/> honoured or dishonoured&apos;. Under the Negotiable Instruments Act, the<lb/> issuance of cheque is to be presumed to be issued for discharge of debt. The<lb/> consequence event &apos;whether the said cheque on presentation honoured or<lb/> not,&apos; is immaterial.<lb/></p>

			<p>65.In the opinion of this Court, even if the said cheque is not<lb/> presented in time and become stale, but it is proved that the cheque was<lb/> issued with intention to discharge the debt or part of the debt then, the<lb/> limitation has to be reckoned from the date of the cheque considering the<lb/> cheque as acknowledgment of debt.<lb/></p>

			<p>66.As far as the facts of this case in hand, the cheque in the name of<lb/> the plaintiff gives him the cause of action to sue and suit being filed within 3<lb/> years from the date on which the cheque bear, this prima facie saves the<lb/> limitation. The plaintiff cannot be desuited on the ground of limitation.<lb/> However, the plaintiff fails to succeed, since, this Court has held that the<lb/> plaintiff has not proved his case for recovery of money and the cheque is not<lb/> issued for any enforcible debt. Therefore, the discussions on limitation<lb/> based on the fact &apos;whether dishonour of cheque will save limitation is<lb/> academics&apos;. Issues 3 and 5 are answered accordingly.<lb/></p>

			<p>67.The first defendant is the signatory of the cheque -Ex P-11 and he<lb/> has signed the cheque on behalf of the 2 nd defendant partnership firm.<lb/> Therefore, the other partners of the 2 nd defendant firm are arrayed as<lb/> defendants 3 and 4. Hence, this court finds no legal error in joinder of<lb/> parties. Issue No. 4 is answered in negative.<lb/></p>

			<p>68.As a result, for the reasons stated, the issues are held against the<lb/> plaintiff and the suit is dismissed with costs.<lb/></p>
