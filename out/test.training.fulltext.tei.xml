<lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/>			<figure>Section 3-Y(1) of the Slum Act provides that the State Government or<lb/> any ofcer generally or specially authorised by it is required to issue a<lb/> photopass to the actual occupier of the dwelling structure in slum<lb/> which is in existence on or prior to 1st January, 1995. Section 3-X(c)<lb/> provides that &quot;Protected occupier&quot; means an occupier of dwelling<lb/> structure who holds a photopass. Sub-section (1) of section 3-Z<lb/> provides that save as provided in sub section (2) of section 3-Z no<lb/> protected occupier shall be evicted from a dwelling structure. Sub-<lb/>section (2) provides that the State Government in larger public interest<lb/> can evict protected occupier from his dwelling structure subject to<lb/> condition of relocating and rehabilitating the protected occupier in<lb/> accordance with the scheme or schemes prepared by the State<lb/> Government in this behalf. Section 3-X(a) defnes a &quot;dwelling<lb/> structure&quot; to mean a structure used as a dwelling or otherwise and<lb/> includes an out-house, shed, hut or other enclosure or structure,<lb/> whether of bricks, masonry, wood, mud, metal or any other material<lb/> whatsoever. Thus, occupants of the structures in slum area become<lb/> protected occupiers provided as on 1st January, 1995 they are in<lb/> occupation of a dwelling structure.<lb/></figure>

The Developers as well as his Advocate are required to be<lb/> reminded that the said requirement is in force with efect from 24 th October, 2018. In<lb/> any event, the Developers admit that till date, i.e. even now when the matter is being<lb/> heard by the Court, they have not made any application seeking necessary permissions<lb/> and nor have they submitted any plans seeking approval / sanction. Again, though the<lb/> Developers have failed to pay the compensation in lieu of temporary alternate<lb/> accommodation to the members of the Petitioner Society since the last two years<lb/> aggregating to approximately Rs. 3 Crores, even at this stage the Developers have<lb/> informed this Court that they are not in a position to clear a substantial part / portion<lb/> of the arrears, but can only deposit Rs. 10 lakhs and that too after two weeks and Rs.<lb/> 20 Lakhs two weeks thereafter. We are therefore convinced that the Developers do not<lb/> have the requisite fnancial capacity even at this stage to pay to the members of the<lb/> Petitioner Society their dues, which are pending since January 2019 and aggregates to<lb/> much more than Rs. 3 Crores as on date. We are also convinced that the modus<lb/> operandi adopted by the Developers is that it is only when they (Developers) are<lb/> ::: Uploaded -29/04/2021<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 :::<lb/> compelled to appear before the Court / authorities and they realize that adverse<lb/> Orders will be passed against them, that they agree to pay a fraction of the huge arrears<lb/> to the members of the Petitioner Society, and thereby seek and obtain an extension of<lb/> time to complete the project, only to once again let down the members by not making<lb/> any payments towards transit accommodation and also not take any steps to redevelop<lb/> the Subject Plot. This is more clearly established from the fact that despite the AGRC<lb/> having passed the impugned Order on 27 th September, 2018, the condition of the<lb/> Subject Plot even on 23 rd August, 2020 and 9 th December, 2020, as can be seen from<lb/> the photographs produced in paragraph 6 of this Order, wherein even the plinth which<lb/> was admittedly constructed in the year 2014 -15 is destroyed. The Learned Advocate<lb/> appearing for the Petitioner Society has informed us that about 17 members after a<lb/> long wait, and with the hope to see the light of the day when the new tenements would<lb/> be allotted to them, have passed away. We cannot be a party to such misery faced by<lb/> the members of the Petitioner Society at the hands of the Developers, who as stated by<lb/> the AGRC have &quot;taken steps for redevelopment&quot; in the year 2006, and have till date<lb/> left the Subject Plot in the condition shown in the photographs at paragraph 6<lb/> hereinabove. We therefore set aside the Order passed by the AGRC dated 27 th<lb/> September, 2018. The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of.<lb/> 37.<lb/> Before parting with this Order, we would like to record that even in<lb/> matters where the authorities like the CEO -SRA and / or AGRC are of the view that<lb/> the time to complete the slum redevelopment projects should be granted to the<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 :::<lb/> defaulting / erring developers, instead of granting unconditional / blanket extension/s<lb/> of time to them, should frst verify whether the concerned developer/s is / are<lb/> fnancially and/or otherwise equipped to complete such projects within the extended<lb/> time lines. In addition thereto, the authorities should also take a bar chart from the<lb/> Developer/s showing how the work would progress during the extended period<lb/> alongwith the necessary undertakings from the Developers with regard to completion<lb/> of the project within such extended time line and also call for compliance reports from<lb/> time to time from the concerned developer/s showing as to whether the work has<lb/> progressed as per the bar chart submitted. Such vigilance and meaningful monitoring<lb/> by the authorities like the CEO -SRA and / or AGRC alone will ensure that the<lb/> orders passed by them do not merely remain paper orders incapable of providing the<lb/> requisite relief to the slum dwellers.<lb/> (RIYAZ I.
