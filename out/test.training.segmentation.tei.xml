On 8 th December, 2006 certifed Annexure II was issued, wherein 124 slum <lb/>dwellers were held to be eligible. 80 slum dwellers handed over their huts to the <lb/>Developers in the year 2010. However, the Developers obtained the Letter of Intent <lb/>(&apos;LOI&apos;) only on 1 st June, 2010 and the revised LOI on 15 th September, 2011. The <lb/>Developers obtained an Amended Intimation of Disapproval (&apos;IOD&apos;) for a composite <lb/>Building No. 1 (&apos;Composite Building&apos;) only on 16 th September, 2011 and obtained the <lb/>plinth Commencement Certifcate (&apos;CC&apos;) for the Composite Building only on 7 th <lb/>June, 2014. <lb/>4. <lb/>The Developers had agreed to complete the construction of the <lb/>Composite Building within 24 months from the date of receipt of the CC. As stated <lb/>earlier though the CC was received on 7 th June, 2014, the Developers except for <lb/>constructing the plinth of the Composite Building in the year 2014-15, not only failed <lb/>to carry out any further construction, but also failed to regularly pay the agreed <lb/>monthly compensation in lieu of temporary alternate accommodation to the members <lb/>of the Petitioner Society, thereby putting the poor and the helpless members of the <lb/>Petitioner Society who were waiting for a roof over their heads since the year 2006 and <lb/>the 80 members who have handed over the possession of their respective huts to the <lb/>Developers since the year 2010, into grave difculty and inconvenience. <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>5. <lb/>According to the Petitioner Society, they were therefore compelled to <lb/>make a representation dated 12 th August, 2016 before the SRA, setting out the <lb/>harassment faced by them at the hands of the Developers. The Assistant Registrar <lb/>C.S. (Eastern &amp; Western Suburbs) / SRA heard the parties and gave directions to pay <lb/>rent compensation to the eligible slum dwellers as per Circular No. 153 of the SRA and <lb/>after payment of the rent due to the eligible slum dwellers, submit a self-declaration <lb/>and to inform the SRA. Since the Developers violated the said direction and failed to <lb/>clear the dues of the slum dwellers and were also responsible in causing inordinate <lb/>delay in implementing the S. R. Scheme, the Petitioner Society in its General Body <lb/>Meeting held on 18 th December, 2016 terminated the appointment of the Developers <lb/>of the subject S.R. Scheme and by their Letter / Application dated 12 th April, 2017, <lb/>requested the SRA to terminate the appointment of the Developers and to appoint <lb/>new developers in their place. <lb/>6. <lb/>On 30 th April, 2017, a General Body Meeting of the Petitioner Society <lb/>was once again held in the presence of the Co-operative Ofcers of the SRA. Out of 91 <lb/>slum dwellers present at the Meeting, 85 slum dwellers decided to terminate the <lb/>appointment of the Developers of the S. R. Scheme. <lb/>7. <lb/>A Show Cause Notice dated 19 th May, 2017, was also issued to the <lb/>Developers calling upon them to explain as to why action under Section 13 (2) of the <lb/>Maharashtra Slum Areas Act (I.C. &amp; R.)

			<body>8. <lb/>The CEO -SRA gave a hearing to the Petitioner Society as well as to the <lb/>Developers. The Developers gave several excuses including blaming the Petitioner <lb/>Society for the delay in completing the rehabilitation project. The CEO -SRA after <lb/>appreciating the grave inconvenience caused to the Petitioner Society by the approach <lb/>/ attitude of the Developers, by his reasoned Order dated 23 rd November, 2017, after <lb/>holding that the it is not disputed that the Scheme has been lingering for about 11 years <lb/>and the Developers are not serious about implementation of the Scheme, terminated <lb/>the appointment of the Respondent No. -1 as Developers of the subject S. R. Scheme <lb/>and granted liberty to the Petitioner Society to appoint a new developer in accordance <lb/>with the Rules, Regulations and Policy of the SRA for implementation of the S. R. <lb/>Scheme. <lb/>9. <lb/>It is submitted by the Petitioner Society that the AGRC without <lb/>appreciating the pathetic plight of the members of the Petitioner Society, for which the <lb/>Developers are solely responsible, or without verifying the fnancial status of the <lb/>Developers, or without making any provision to ensure compliance of its Order, by its <lb/>impugned Order dated 27 th September, 2018, proceeded to set aside the Order of the <lb/>CEO -SRA dated 23 rd November, 2017, and granted 2 months&apos; time to the <lb/>Developers, i.e. upto 27 th November, 2018, to clear the arrears towards interim rent / <lb/>compensation and 2 years&apos; time i.e. upto 27 th November, 2020, to obtain necessary <lb/>permission from the SRA / other authorities and complete the construction work of <lb/>the Composite Building as per the sanctioned plans and rehabilitate the slum dwellers. <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>10. <lb/>The Petitioner Society has at the outset also pointed out that though <lb/>they are aggrieved by the Order passed by the AGRC setting aside the Order of the <lb/>CEO -SRA dated 23 rd November, 2017, and granting further time to the Developers <lb/>to deposit the arrears towards interim rent / compensation i.e. upto 27 th November, <lb/>2018 and to obtain necessary permissions and complete the construction of the <lb/>Composite Building by 27 th November, 2020, the Developers not only delayed the <lb/>payment of arrears, but immediately from January 2019 failed to pay and have till date <lb/>not paid a single Rupee towards transit accommodation to the members of the <lb/>Petitioner Society, which has resulted in arrears mounting upto Rs. 2,89,75,500/-<lb/>(Two Crores Eighty-Nine Lakhs Seventy-Five thousand only) as on 30 th September, <lb/>2020. In addition, thereto the Developers have till date not complied with any of the <lb/>other specifc directions given by the AGRC to obtain permissions and construct the <lb/>Composite Building within 2 years from the date of the impugned Order of the AGRC <lb/>dated 27 th September, 2018, but till the date of hearing of the above Writ Petition have <lb/>not even bothered to apply for the necessary permissions as directed by the AGRC on <lb/>27 th September, 2018. Consequently, the plinth which was constructed in the year <lb/>2014-15 is also damaged and destroyed and the photographs taken on 23 rd August, <lb/>2020 and 9 th December, 2020 of the Subject Plot on which the Developers were <lb/>required to construct the Composite Building before 27 th November, 2020 as directed <lb/>by the AGRC, portrays the completely neglected condition of the Subject Plot as <lb/>under : <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>11. <lb/>The facts in the matter are now set out in brief hereunder : <lb/>11.1 <lb/>The slum dwellers residing on the Subject Plot, in the year 2006 formed <lb/>the Petitioner Society i.e. Hanuman Nagar ( Jogeshwari) SRA CHS (Prop.). <lb/>11.2. <lb/>Since the Developers are also the Owners of the Subject Plot, in the year <lb/>2006 the majority members of the Petitioner Society appointed them as Developers <lb/>for the S.R. Scheme. In view thereof, the Developers submitted to the SRA a proposal <lb/>on 22 nd July, 2006 for redevelopment of the Subject Plot under Regulation 33 (10) of <lb/>the DCR. <lb/>11.3. <lb/>Thereafter, the Additional Collector (E &amp; R) / Western Suburb &amp; <lb/>Competent Authority issued certifed Annexure-II on 8 th December, 2006 for total 141 <lb/>slum dwellers, out of which 124 slum dwellers are held eligible. 80 slum dwellers <lb/>handed over their huts to the Developers in the year 2010, on a promise by the <lb/>Developers to pay monthly compensation / rent towards temporary alternate <lb/>accommodation. The members of the Petitioner Society based on the said promise <lb/>arranged for temporary alternate accommodation until the new building was <lb/>constructed on the Subject Plot and they were rehabilitated therein. <lb/>11.4. <lb/>The Developers obtained the LOI on 1 st June, 2010 and revised LOI on <lb/>15 th September, 2011. Again, the amended IOD for the Composite Building was <lb/>obtained only on 16 th September, 2011 and the plinth CC only on 7 th June, 2014. <lb/>11.5. <lb/>In the year 2014 -15 the Developers carried out construction upto plinth <lb/>level and though they were required to rehabilitate the members of the Petitioner <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>Society within 24 months from the date of the CC, i.e. by 7 th June, 2016, the <lb/>construction remained at plinth level till date. The Developers also defaulted in <lb/>making payment of the transit accommodation rent as agreed, thereby creating serious <lb/>problems for the members of the Petitioner Society / the slum dwellers, who in turn <lb/>defaulted in paying the license fees to their respective licensors for using the licensed <lb/>premises as transit accommodation, and consequently were served with eviction <lb/>notices by the respective licensors. <lb/>11.6. <lb/>The members of the Petitioner Society fled representation dated 12 th <lb/>August, 2016 before the SRA setting out the aforestated facts. <lb/>11.7. <lb/>The Assistant Registrar C.S. (Eastern &amp; Western Suburbs) / SRA heard <lb/>the parties and directed the Developers to pay rent / compensation to the eligible slum <lb/>dwellers as per Circular No. 153 of the SRA and after payment of the rent due to the <lb/>eligible slum dwellers, submit self-declaration and inform the SRA. <lb/>11.8. <lb/>Since the Developers violated the said direction and failed to clear the <lb/>dues of the slum dwellers and thereby caused inordinate delay in implementing the S. <lb/>R. Scheme, the Petitioner Society in its General Body Meeting held on 18 th December, <lb/>2016, terminated the appointment of the Developers and by their Letter / Application <lb/>dated 12 th April, 2017, requested the SRA to terminate the appointment of Respondent <lb/>No. 1 as Developers and to appoint new developer/s in their place. <lb/>11.9. <lb/>On 30 th April, 2017, a General Body Meeting of the Petitioner Society <lb/>was once again held in the presence of the Ofcers of the SRA.

			<body>The CEO -SRA after hearing the Learned Advocates appearing for the <lb/>parties, by his Order dated 23 rd November, 2017 held that the Scheme has been <lb/>lingering for about 11 years, and it will have to be concluded that the Developers are <lb/>not serious about the implementation of the Scheme. As regards the ofer of the <lb/>Developers to clear the arrears within 45 days, the CEO -SRA rejected the same on <lb/>the ground that the same cannot be accepted at the last moment and the same is just a <lb/>plea taken by the Developers for condonation of default in payment of rent till the date <lb/>of hearing. The CEO -SRA thereafter recorded that the appointment of the <lb/>Developers of the subject S. R. Scheme is terminated with efect from 4 th October, <lb/>2017; the Petitioner Society is at liberty to appoint a new developer of their choice in <lb/>accordance with Rules, Regulations and Policy of SRA for implementation of S.R. <lb/>Scheme and submit the proposal for acceptance to the SRA; the Engineering <lb/>Department of SRA was directed to appoint Government Approved Valuer to value <lb/>the expenses legally incurred by the Developers on site and inform the same to the <lb/>Petitioner Society, and the newly appointed developer would have to reimburse the <lb/>actual expenses legally incurred by the Developers for implementation of subject S.R. <lb/>Scheme till the date of termination. <lb/>11.15. <lb/>Being aggrieved by the Order of the CEO -SRA, the Developers fled <lb/>Application (L) No. 107 of 2018, before the AGRC impugning the Order of the CEO -<lb/>SRA dated 23 rd November, 2017, interalia terminating their appointment as <lb/>Developers. <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

It is further submitted that the <lb/>AGRC ought not to have set aside the Order passed by the CEO -SRA on the ground <lb/>that if the Order of the CEO -SRA is upheld the same will cause a further delay in the <lb/>development of the Subject Plot of land in occupation of the Petitioner Society.

			<body>into consideration the facts and circumstances of the present case, which are in no way <lb/>similar to the facts and circumstance in the case of Awdesh Tiwari, and that in the <lb/>present case an individual slum dweller is not claiming any right to decide which <lb/>Society or which Developer should implement the Scheme and the Petitioner Society <lb/>has moved the SRA to change the present Developers and appoint a new developer to <lb/>implement the Scheme only because the present Developers as set out hereinabove, <lb/>have miserably failed to implement the Scheme. The Learned Advocate for the <lb/>Petitioner Society has also pointed out that the Developers have not only delayed the <lb/>payment of arrears but immediately from 2019 failed to pay and have till date not paid <lb/>a single Rupee towards transit accommodation to the members of the Petitioner <lb/>Society which has resulted in arrears mounting upto Rs. 2,89,75,500/-as on 30 th <lb/>September, 2020. The Developers have also failed to comply with the directions to <lb/>obtain necessary permissions from the SRA / other authorities and to put the <lb/>members of the Petitioner Society in possession of the rehab building on or before 27 th <lb/>September, 2020. In view thereof, the plinth constructed in the year 2014-15 is also <lb/>completely damaged / destroyed, as can be seen from the photographs taken on 13 th <lb/>August, 2020 and 9 th December, 2020 and reproduced in paragraph 6 hereinabove.

The Developers have admitted that they have not paid rent <lb/>and are unable to pay the arrears of rent even as on date (which as per the table <lb/>submitted by the Petitioner Society aggregates to Rs. 2,89,75,500/-as on 30 th <lb/>September, 2020), due to slow-down in the realty market in the year 2019 and <lb/>thereafter due to the Pandemic.

It is submitted that therefore the Petitioner Society / its <lb/>members cannot allow the Developers to mislead and cheat them anymore. <lb/>15. <lb/>The Learned Advocate appearing for the Developers thereupon <lb/>reiterated what is stated in paragraph 5 of the Afdavit of the Developers dated 11 th <lb/>December, 2021 namely, that the Developers are in the hands of this Court and <lb/>considering the interest of everyone, particularly the Petitioner Society and the <lb/>Developers, this Court be pleased to pass such orders as it may deem ft in the interest <lb/>of justice and wellbeing of all. In view thereof, this Court has proceeded to hear the <lb/>matter fnally at the stage of admission. <lb/>16. <lb/>Mr. Prasad Dhakephalkar, Senior Advocate appearing for the AGRC <lb/>submitted before us that the only reason why the AGRC proceeded to set aside the <lb/>Order of the CEO -SRA terminating the appointment of the Developers, as <lb/>Developers of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme on the Subject Plot, is because if a new <lb/>developer is to be appointed as ordered by the CEO -SRA, the entire procedure will <lb/>have to be freshly initiated, which may not be in the interest of the slum dwellers / <lb/>members of the Petitioner Society. When this Court questioned Mr. Dhakephalkar <lb/>how an unconditional blanket extension was granted by the AGRC to the Developers <lb/>without verifying whether they are equipped to complete the construction (more so, <lb/>when they had admittedly failed to pay the agreed rent / compensation to the <lb/>members of the Petitioner Society) and without taking any undertaking to complete <lb/>the project within a specifed period and stipulating the consequences of default and <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>without asking the Developers to fle progress reports with the SRA at regular <lb/>intervals, Mr. Dhakephalkar agreed that the Order of the AGRC is lacking in this <lb/>respect and the Court may direct the AGRC to introduce such efective measures in <lb/>its orders passed in future. This Court also pointed out to Mr. Dhakephalkar that in <lb/>view of the required care not being taken by the AGRC to ensure that its Orders are <lb/>implemented / complied with by the Developers, the Developers have in the present <lb/>case not moved an inch to comply with the directions of the AGRC, and it is the <lb/>members of the Petitioner Society who have sufered interalia due to such an <lb/>inefective Order. <lb/>17. <lb/>We have perused the Writ Petition alongwith its Annexures, the <lb/>afdavit fled by the Developers, the submissions advanced by the Learned Advocates <lb/>for the Parties and the documents relied upon by them in support of their submissions <lb/>i.e. the photographs reproduced hereinabove and the statement showing arrears of <lb/>transit rent payable by the Developers to the members of the Petitioner Society as on <lb/>30 th September, 2020. <lb/>18. <lb/>The relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, <lb/>Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971 (&apos;the Slum Act&apos;) and Regulation 33 (10) of <lb/>the Development Control Regulations for Greater Mumbai, 1991 (DCR) pertaining to <lb/>the Scheme of rehabilitation of slum dwellers, have been clearly explained by the <lb/>Division Bench of this Court in the case of Awdesh Tiwari vs. Chief Executive <lb/>Ofcere Slum Rehabilitation Authority and others (supra), paragraphs 12 to 15 being <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>relevant, are reproduced hereunder : <lb/>&quot;12. Now the question before us is the manner in which the scheme <lb/>under Regulation 33(10) should be implemented. The entire case will <lb/>have to be examined in the perspective of rights of the slum dwellers. <lb/>Section 3-Y(1) of the Slum Act provides that the State Government or <lb/>any ofcer generally or specially authorised by it is required to issue a <lb/>photopass to the actual occupier of the dwelling structure in slum <lb/>which is in existence on or prior to 1st January, 1995. Section 3-X(c) <lb/>provides that &quot;Protected occupier&quot; means an occupier of dwelling <lb/>structure who holds a photopass. Sub-section (1) of section 3-Z <lb/>provides that save as provided in sub section (2) of section 3-Z no <lb/>protected occupier shall be evicted from a dwelling structure. Sub-<lb/>section (2) provides that the State Government in larger public interest <lb/>can evict protected occupier from his dwelling structure subject to <lb/>condition of relocating and rehabilitating the protected occupier in <lb/>accordance with the scheme or schemes prepared by the State <lb/>Government in this behalf. Section 3-X(a) defnes a &quot;dwelling <lb/>structure&quot; to mean a structure used as a dwelling or otherwise and <lb/>includes an out-house, shed, hut or other enclosure or structure, <lb/>whether of bricks, masonry, wood, mud, metal or any other material <lb/>whatsoever. Thus, occupants of the structures in slum area become <lb/>protected occupiers provided as on 1st January, 1995 they are in <lb/>occupation of a dwelling structure. <lb/>13. Regulation 33(10) of D.C. Regulations provides for a scheme for <lb/>rehabilitation of slum dwellers. Under such rehabilitation scheme, <lb/>there is a provision for providing a tenement in exchange of a dwelling <lb/>structure whose inhabitants&apos; names and structures appear in the <lb/>electoral roll prepared with reference to 1st January, 1995. Clause (i) of <lb/>Appendix IV of D.C. Regulation lays down that hutment dwellers in <lb/>the slum or on pavement who are eligible in accordance with the <lb/>provisions of D.C. Regulation 33(10) shall be entitled in exchange for <lb/>their structure a residential tenement free of cost having carpet area of <lb/>225 sq.ft. including balcony, bath and water closet, but excluding <lb/>common free of costs. Thus, the right of a hutment dweller who is in <lb/>possession of a hutment on an area to which the Scheme is made <lb/>applicable is for a tenement admeasuring 225 sq.ft. in exchange of the <lb/>hut irrespective of the area of the hut. Thus, an individual hutment <lb/>dweller gets this limited right apart from right to seek protection from <lb/>eviction under section 3-Z(1) of the Slum Act. However, there is <lb/>nothing in the scheme of D.C. Regulation 33(10) that an individual <lb/>slum dweller gets a right to decide which Society or which developer <lb/>should implement the scheme. <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>14. Appendix IV of Regulation 33(10) provides that the land on which <lb/>rehabilitation component is constructed will be leased to co-operative <lb/>housing society of the slum dwellers on thirty years lease. Clause 2.1 of <lb/>Appendix IV provides that the proposal for each slum rehabilitation <lb/>project shall be submitted to Slum Rehabilitation Authority along with <lb/>all necessary documents, no-objection certifcates, and the plans as <lb/>may be decided by the. Slum Rehabilitation Authority from time to <lb/>time. The SRA has issued Guidelines for implementation of SRA <lb/>scheme. Clause 2 of the procedure incorporated in the said guidelines <lb/>provides that 70% or more of the eligible slum dwellers in a slum or on <lb/>pavement in a viable stretch at one place have to show their willingness <lb/>to join Slum Rehabilitation Scheme and come together to form a <lb/>proposed cooperative housing society. Clause 3 of the guidelines <lb/>further provides that the chief promoter, ofce bearers and the <lb/>members of the proposed society should collect the documents such as <lb/>7/12 extract and the Property Registration card of the plot on which <lb/>the slum is situated. After collecting necessary documents, they should <lb/>then get the plot surveyed/measured and prepare map of the plot <lb/>showing slum structures thereon. While undertaking the survey, they <lb/>should collect the information of the proposed members/slum-dwellers <lb/>and fll up the self prepared Annexure-II prescribed by SRA. <lb/>Annexure-H contains details of structures occupied by the slum-<lb/>dwellers, their number and type of structures such as residential, <lb/>industrial, commercial, amenity structures etc. and the list of eligible <lb/>and ineligible occupants. The guidelines record that earlier procedure <lb/>was that the promoter/co-operative housing society should frst <lb/>approach competent authority for obtaining certifcation of Annexure-<lb/>II before they can put an application for grant of scheme to the SRA. <lb/>However, it is recorded that such procedure is discontinued and now <lb/>the procedure provides that Annexure-II format is required to be flled <lb/>up by the promoter/co-operative housing society for submitting the <lb/>same along with proposal for sanction to SRA. <lb/>15. Competent Authorities for certifying Annexure II have been <lb/>notifed. In case of the lands vesting in the State Governments Revenue <lb/>Ofcers such as Additional Collector, Deputy Collector have been <lb/>nominated. In case of lands vesting in the Municipal Corporation, the <lb/>Municipal Ofcers have been nominated. The guidelines further <lb/>contemplate that after obtaining name reservation of the proposed <lb/>society, step should be taken to search a competent developer who will <lb/>act as promoter of the scheme. The scheme provides that instead of <lb/>appointing a developer, the society itself or a NGO can implement <lb/>rehabilitation scheme as a promoter. After appointing a promoter, <lb/>agreements are required to be executed by and between the promoters <lb/>and the members. Thereafter, the promoter has to appoint an architect <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>in consultation with the proposed co-operative housing society. The <lb/>Architect is entrusted with the work of preparation of plans. The <lb/>procedure contemplates that all required documents such as building <lb/>plan, layout plan, property register plan along with Annexure-I, self <lb/>prepared Annexure-II and Annexure-III should be submitted to the <lb/>SRA by the architect along with application for sanction of Slum <lb/>Rehabilitation Scheme. Annexure-I gives details of ownership of land, <lb/>details of plot area, existing hutments, extent and type of reservations, <lb/>amenities, FSI available etc. The prescribed format shows that <lb/>Annexure-I is to be signed by architect and owner/chief promoter of <lb/>the Society. Annexure-II is to be signed by the chief promoter of the <lb/>Society/owner/developer/NGO. Annexure-HI is related to fnancial <lb/>capability of the developer to execute SRA scheme which is required to <lb/>be signed by the developer and architect. Clause No. 11 of Part IV of <lb/>the Guidelines on the Procedure prescribes that after a pre-scrutiny by <lb/>designated engineer of SRA with a view to ensure completeness of the <lb/>proposal so far as a documents are concerned, proposals are accepted <lb/>and computer fle number is allotted to the scheme on payment of <lb/>scrutiny fees. Upon the acceptance of the proposal, the scrutiny of <lb/>Annexure-I, Annexure-II and Annexure-III starts simultaneously and <lb/>after scrutiny of the Annexures by diferent authorities, a letter of <lb/>intent is issued. From the procedure prescribed, it is clear that a <lb/>comprehensive application containing plans and other requisite <lb/>documents, Annexure-I, Annexure-II and Annexure-III shall be <lb/>submitted by the architect to the SRA and after ensuring that all <lb/>documents are fled with the proposal a computer number is given to <lb/>the fle and only thereafter scrutiny of all the three Annexures starts <lb/>simultaneously.&quot; <lb/>19. <lb/>As stated hereinabove, the slum dwellers residing on the Subject Plot <lb/>formed the proposed Society sometime in the year 2006. Since the Respondent No. 1 -<lb/>Developers are also the owners of the Subject Plot, the Petitioner Society, in the year <lb/>2006 passed a resolution at its Annual General Meeting appointing Respondent No. 1 <lb/>-Developers, as Developers for the S.

In other words, the <lb/>Developers by their irresponsible and insensitive conduct almost brought the members <lb/>of the Petitioner Society on the streets. <lb/>23. <lb/>Pursuant to the representation dated 12 th August, 2016 fled by the <lb/>members of the Petitioner Society before the SRA setting out the aforestated facts, the <lb/>Assistant Registrar C.S.

Act, 1971 (the Slum Act) should not be <lb/>initiated. <lb/>27. <lb/>The CEO -SRA gave a hearing to the Petitioner Society as well as the <lb/>Developers and held that the Scheme is lingering for about 11 years and that the <lb/>Developers are not serious about implementation of the Scheme. At this stage the <lb/>Developers made an ofer to clear the arrears, not immediately but within 45 days, <lb/>which was correctly rejected by the CEO -SRA, who apparently, saw through the game <lb/>of the Developers to stall, for the time being, an adverse Order being passed against <lb/>them. It is obvious that the Developers by committing breach of the promises made to <lb/>the members of the Petitioner Society left them completely in the lurch, and as stated <lb/>hereinabove brought them almost on the streets. The reasons given for the delay, <lb/>including the allegations made against the members of the Petitioner Society, were <lb/>devoid of particulars and therefore the CEO -SRA ignoring the same, passed his <lb/>reasoned Order, the operational portion of which is reproduced hereunder : <lb/>&quot;1.

Scheme since the year 2006, by not carrying out any <lb/>construction beyond the plinth since the year 2014-15 and also not making payments of <lb/>the agreed rent / compensation in lieu of the temporary transit accommodation, the <lb/>AGRC proceeded to pass the impugned Order on the grounds that the Developers <lb/>being owners of the Subject Plot have the frst option / choice to redevelop the <lb/>Subject Plot owned by them; that the Developers have already taken steps to redevelop <lb/>the Subject Plot in the year 2006 and the Developers have already constructed the <lb/>plinth for the composite building as per the permission granted by the SRA. <lb/>31. <lb/>It is an admitted fact that the Developers being the owners of the Subject <lb/>Plot are already given the frst option / choice to redevelop the Subject Plot owned by <lb/>them. In fact, the Petitioner Society passed a resolution in the year 2006 appointing <lb/>them as the Developers for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme and the Developers <lb/>thereupon submitted to the SRA a proposal dated 22 nd July, 2006 for redevelopment of <lb/>the Subject Plot under Regulation 33(10) of the DCR. The Developers obtained an <lb/>LOI only on 1 st June, 2010.

			<body>the eligible members of the Petitioner Society in the new building on or before 7 th June <lb/>2016, i.e. within a period of two years from the receipt of the CC, it is an admitted fact <lb/>that the Developers carried out construction upto the plinth by 2014-15, but thereafter <lb/>miserably failed to carry out any further construction. The AGRC has passed the <lb/>impugned Order without taking into account the aforestated facts. It is also pertinent <lb/>to note that the reasons given by the Developers before the AGRC explaining the delay <lb/>in completing the construction, are totally vague and devoid of any particulars and <lb/>therefore, except for setting out the same in the impugned Order, the AGRC has not <lb/>even attempted to comment upon and / or deal with the same. <lb/>32. <lb/>The AGRC has in support of its Order dated 27 th September, 2018, also <lb/>recorded that if the Order of the CEO -SRA is upheld the same will cause a further <lb/>delay in the development of the Subject Plot in occupation of the Petitioner Society. <lb/>However, the AGRC failed to realize that a blanket Order passed by it, granting two <lb/>years time to the Developers to complete the construction of the Composite Building <lb/>and to put the members of the Petitioner Society in occupation of the same, without <lb/>verifying whether the Developers are fnancially and otherwise equipped to complete <lb/>the construction and without providing any safeguards to ensure compliance of the <lb/>Order, in the form of directions to the Developers to intimate to the SRA, from time to <lb/>time the progress of the construction, if breached will result in wasting two years <lb/>granted vide its impugned Order, thereby causing further delay, unimaginable <lb/>prejudice and hardship to the members of the Petitioner Society. <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>33. <lb/>The AGRC has in its impugned Order also referred to the decision of <lb/>this Court in Awdesh Tiwari &amp; Ors. (supra) wherein it is held that, &quot;there is nothing in <lb/>the Scheme of D.C. Regulation 33 (10) that an individual slum dweller get a right to decide <lb/>which Society or which Developer should implement the Scheme.&quot; As correctly submitted <lb/>by the Advocate for the Petitioner Society the said Judgement renders no assistance to <lb/>the Developers in the present case. In the present case an individual slum dweller is <lb/>not claiming any right to decide as to which Society, or which Developer should <lb/>implement the Scheme. In fact, in the present case only since the Developers as set <lb/>out hereinabove, have miserably failed to implement the Scheme, the Petitioner <lb/>Society is compelled to seek change of developers. The decision of Awdesh Tiwari &amp; <lb/>Ors. (supra) does not hold that even if a Developer fails to implement the Scheme to <lb/>the satisfaction of the SRA and lets down the members of the slum society, as in the <lb/>present case, the members of the Society cannot approach the SRA to change the <lb/>Developer/s. In fact, we would like to make it clear that in the circumstances, as in the <lb/>present case, the SRA and / or the members of the slum society are certainly not <lb/>expected to be helpless spectators / victims of the unfair and unjust behavior on the <lb/>part of the Developer/s, but have every right to change / seek change of the erring <lb/>developer/s. <lb/>34. <lb/>It is pertinent to note that in the case of Omkar Realtors &amp; Developers <lb/>Pvt. Ltd. vs. Slum Rehabilitation Authority &amp; Ors. 2 , the Division Bench of this Court <lb/>2 2010 SCC Online Bom 1650 <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>(Coram: Mohit S. Shah, C.J. and D. Y. Chandrachud (DR.) J. as they then were), have <lb/>whilst dealing with an identical submission held as under : <lb/>&quot;17. It is true that as per the aforesaid judgment of this Court, the individ-<lb/>ual slum dweller may not have a right to decide which society or devel-<lb/>oper should implement the scheme, but when the society itself has lost <lb/>confdence in the developer whose acts of omission and commission have <lb/>already been taken into consideration by the Slum Rehabilitation Author-<lb/>ity and the Slum Rehabilitation Authority found substance in the griev-<lb/>ances of the society, it is not possible to say that the views of the entire co <lb/>-operative society become irrelevant. The very fact that the scheme of the <lb/>Slum Rehabilitation Authority provides that the developer should obtain <lb/>consent of 70% of the members of the society goes to show that the devel-<lb/>oper should have confdence of the society. May be after the LOI is issued <lb/>in favour of the developer, if for some extraneous reasons the society <lb/>passes a resolution for removing the developer without any justifcation, <lb/>the views of the society may not be acted upon by Slum Rehabilitation <lb/>Authority.&quot; <lb/>35. <lb/>The impugned Order passed by the AGRC on the grounds set out <lb/>therein is therefore totally incorrect and exhibits lack of application of mind. Though <lb/>the AGRC has stated that the impugned Order is passed by them &quot;in larger interest of <lb/>slum dwellers and to enable speedier implementation of subject SRA Scheme&quot; they are <lb/>proved completely wrong, since as stated hereinabove the impugned Order which has <lb/>been breached by the Developers in its entirety, and the period of two years granted, <lb/>without the progress of work being monitored, has not only delayed the <lb/>implementation of the Scheme by two years, but the Developers have by their brazen <lb/>conduct of not making any payments since January 2019 towards transit <lb/>accommodation to the members of the Petitioner Society which as on 30 th September, <lb/>2020 has mounted to a whopping sum of Rs. 2,89,75,500/-, has almost brought the <lb/>::: Uploaded on -<lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

			<body>members of the Petitioner Society on the streets, since they are unable to pay the <lb/>license fee to their licensors. <lb/>36. <lb/>The Learned Advocate appearing for the Developers has submitted that <lb/>since the Developers are now required to provide permanent accommodation to each <lb/>of the members of the Petitioner Society admeasuring 300 sq.ft., instead of the earlier <lb/>requirement of providing an area of 269 sq.ft., he will now have to submit fresh plans <lb/>seeking approval / sanction. The Developers as well as his Advocate are required to be <lb/>reminded that the said requirement is in force with efect from 24 th October, 2018. In <lb/>any event, the Developers admit that till date, i.e. even now when the matter is being <lb/>heard by the Court, they have not made any application seeking necessary permissions <lb/>and nor have they submitted any plans seeking approval / sanction. Again, though the <lb/>Developers have failed to pay the compensation in lieu of temporary alternate <lb/>accommodation to the members of the Petitioner Society since the last two years <lb/>aggregating to approximately Rs. 3 Crores, even at this stage the Developers have <lb/>informed this Court that they are not in a position to clear a substantial part / portion <lb/>of the arrears, but can only deposit Rs. 10 lakhs and that too after two weeks and Rs. <lb/>20 Lakhs two weeks thereafter. We are therefore convinced that the Developers do not <lb/>have the requisite fnancial capacity even at this stage to pay to the members of the <lb/>Petitioner Society their dues, which are pending since January 2019 and aggregates to <lb/>much more than Rs. 3 Crores as on date. We are also convinced that the modus <lb/>operandi adopted by the Developers is that it is only when they (Developers) are <lb/>::: Uploaded -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>

This is more clearly established from the fact that despite the AGRC <lb/>having passed the impugned Order on 27 th September, 2018, the condition of the <lb/>Subject Plot even on 23 rd August, 2020 and 9 th December, 2020, as can be seen from <lb/>the photographs produced in paragraph 6 of this Order, wherein even the plinth which <lb/>was admittedly constructed in the year 2014 -15 is destroyed. The Learned Advocate <lb/>appearing for the Petitioner Society has informed us that about 17 members after a <lb/>long wait, and with the hope to see the light of the day when the new tenements would <lb/>be allotted to them, have passed away. We cannot be a party to such misery faced by <lb/>the members of the Petitioner Society at the hands of the Developers, who as stated by <lb/>the AGRC have &quot;taken steps for redevelopment&quot; in the year 2006, and have till date <lb/>left the Subject Plot in the condition shown in the photographs at paragraph 6 <lb/>hereinabove. We therefore set aside the Order passed by the AGRC dated 27 th <lb/>September, 2018. The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. <lb/>37. <lb/>Before parting with this Order, we would like to record that even in <lb/>matters where the authorities like the CEO -SRA and / or AGRC are of the view that <lb/>the time to complete the slum redevelopment projects should be granted to the <lb/>::: Uploaded on -29/04/2021 <lb/>::: Downloaded on -13/07/2022 02:18:29 ::: <lb/></body>
