			<body>A. <lb/>A secret information was received by the NCB on 26.05.2014 to <lb/>the effect that a parcel lying at DHL Express Pvt. India Ltd. 40 Okhla <lb/>Estate, New Delhi, was suspected to contain narcotic substances. The <lb/>information revealed that the parcel had been booked from ANS <lb/>Express Services Pvt. Ltd. 413 Sant Nagar, East of Kailash, New <lb/>Delhi under AWB No. 5546780993, with Liberia (Africa) as the <lb/>destination. <lb/>B. <lb/>An NCB team reached the DHL office at 2:30 PM on <lb/>26.05.2014. In the presence of two independent witnesses, the parcel <lb/>bearing AWB No. 5546780993 was opened, and contained ladies&apos; <lb/>clothes and accessories, including a packet of 12 &quot;thread piece rolls&quot;. <lb/>One of the thread piece rolls was found to have a cavity, which <lb/>contained an off white coloured powder in a roll. A small quantity of <lb/>the powder was tested with the help of field-testing kit, and gave <lb/>positive result for heroin. The remaining 11 thread piece rolls were <lb/>thereafter opened, and contained similar cavities with off white <lb/>coloured powder. The off white coloured powder from each of the 11 <lb/>thread piece rolls was tested with the field-testing kit, and it also gave <lb/>positive result for heroin. <lb/>C. <lb/>The powder from the 12 cavities, having the same colour, <lb/>texture and properties, was thereafter mixed, and was transferred into <lb/>a transparent plastic packet which was weighed on an electronic <lb/>weighing machine, and came to weigh 200 grams. <lb/>D. <lb/>Two samples of 5 grams each were drawn, and put in separate <lb/>zip-lock pouches, which in turn, were put in separate white paper <lb/></body>

			<body>envelopes. The packets were sealed with the NCB seal, and signed by <lb/>the Investigating Officer [hereinafter, &quot;IO&quot;], and the independent <lb/>witnesses. The remaining 190 grams of heroin was kept in a separate <lb/>transparent package in a white cloth, and similarly sealed and signed. <lb/>The remaining stitching material was separately wrapped. The parcel <lb/>contained the name of the consignor as Mr. Ashish Kanojia, 78, Block-<lb/>C Duggal Colony, Khanpur, Delhi, 110062, and the consignee as Lisa <lb/>Phombeh, Perry Town V, OA.A, Monrovia, Liberia, Post 1000, <lb/>Liberia. <lb/>E. <lb/>Notices under Section 67 of the Act were issued to both the <lb/>independent witnesses and their statements were taken on 09.06.2014. <lb/>Two other witnesses, Mr. Shamsher Singh of ANS Express Services <lb/>Pvt. Ltd. and Mr. Arjun Pal Singh of Balaji Courier &amp; Cargo, B-7 <lb/>Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, were also issued notices under Section 67 of <lb/>the Act, and they made their statements on 04.07.2014 and 14.08.2014 <lb/>respectively. <lb/>F. <lb/>Mr. Ashish Kanojia, the consignor of the parcel, was also issued <lb/>a notice under Section 67 of the Act, and made a voluntary statement <lb/>on 01.06.2014 1 . <lb/>G. <lb/>On the basis of his statement, an information was then prepared <lb/>by the IO that the parcel belonged to one Mr. Jonas Orji, who is a <lb/>Nigerian national, and is a resident at House No. 363, Dhaka Johar, <lb/>near Parmanand Colony, New Delhi [hereinafter, &quot;the property&quot;]. It <lb/></body>

			<body>was stated that Mr. Jonas Orji had called Mr. Ashish Kanojia again on <lb/>02.06.2014 for delivery of another parcel at his residence. An <lb/>apprehension was recorded that Mr. Jonas Orji might be involved in <lb/>drug trafficking, and if apprehended, huge quantity of narcotics may <lb/>be recovered from him. <lb/>H. <lb/>A team was thereafter constituted, which was sent to the <lb/>residence of Mr. Jonas Orji on 02.06.2014 at 11:40 AM. The owner of <lb/>the property, Mr. Sunil Gulati, agreed to act as an independent <lb/>witness. The house was approached in his presence. A man, who <lb/>identified himself as Mr. Ejike Jonas Orji [the applicant herein], and a <lb/>lady, who identified herself as Ms. Ratharmi Sero [hereinafter, &quot;Ms. <lb/>Sero&quot;], were present in the house at the time of the search. Both of <lb/>them were served with notices under Section 50 of the Act, but <lb/>declined to be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate. On <lb/>their personal search, nothing incriminating was recovered from the <lb/>two individuals. <lb/>I. <lb/>On searching the house, an &quot;Orange coloured lehenga&quot; was <lb/>found on a table in the first room of the house. Some substance was <lb/>found to be concealed/stitched inside the layers of the gotta of the <lb/>lehenga. It was cut open, and found to contain a tube-shaped <lb/>transparent polythene, which contained off white coloured powder. <lb/>The powder was tested with DD kit, and gave positive result for <lb/>heroin. Upon cutting all the layers of gotta, 70 such tubes were found, <lb/>each of which contained similar off white coloured powder. <lb/></body>

			<body>J. <lb/>A small quantity of the powder was taken from each of the <lb/>tubes, and was subsequently tested with the DD kit. Each of the <lb/>samples gave positive results for heroin. <lb/>K. <lb/>The powder from all the tubes, having the same colour, texture <lb/>and properties, was thereafter mixed, and transferred into a transparent <lb/>packet, which was found to weigh 265 grams. <lb/>L. <lb/>Two samples of 5 grams each were drawn, and put in polythene <lb/>pouches, which in turn were kept in white envelopes. They were <lb/>signed by the applicant herein, the IO, and the independent witness <lb/>and was subsequently sealed with the seal of NCB. The remaining <lb/>quantity of the powder was kept in a transparent packet, and stitched <lb/>in a white cloth, and similarly signed and sealed. <lb/>M. During the search of a bedroom, small crushed pieces of a &quot;dark <lb/>green coloured substance&quot; was found wrapped in plastic tape, hidden <lb/>in a wooden almirah. Testing of a small quantity of the same with the <lb/>help of the DD kit gave positive result for charas. The substance was <lb/>transferred to a transparent polythene bag, and when weighed, was <lb/>found to be 170 grams. <lb/>N. <lb/>Two samples of 25 grams each were drawn, kept in separate <lb/>zip-lock pouches, which in turn were kept in white paper envelopes, <lb/>and similarly signed and sealed. The remaining 120 grams of the <lb/>substance was kept in a transparent packet, stitched in a white marking <lb/>cloth, signed and sealed. Panchnama and test memos were prepared, <lb/>which were signed by the applicant and the IO, as well as by the <lb/>independent witness. <lb/></body>

			<body>O. <lb/>The applicant and Ms. Sero were thereafter issued notices under <lb/>Section 67 of the Act, and were asked to appear forthwith before the <lb/>NCB. Ms. Sero made a statement on the same date that she was not <lb/>aware of the alleged business of drug trafficking of the applicant, who <lb/>is her husband. As a result, she was not arrested. The applicant made <lb/>his statement before the NCB on 03.06.2014. <lb/>P. <lb/>Consequent upon the recovery of 200 grams of heroin from the <lb/>parcel, 265 grams of heroin and 170 grams of charas from the <lb/>applicant&apos;s house, and on the basis of his statement under Section 67 <lb/>of the Act, the applicant was arrested on 03.06.2014. <lb/>Q. <lb/>Mr. Sunil Gulati [owner of the property and the independent <lb/>witness] appeared before the NCB on 09.06.2014, and made his <lb/>statement under Section 67 of the Act. <lb/>R. <lb/>Enquires were made regarding the applicant&apos;s mobile number <lb/>8447262566, which was found to be issued in the name of one Mr. <lb/>Pradeep Kumar. Notice under Section 67 of the Act was issued to Mr. <lb/>Pradeep Kumar on 07.07.2014. Mr. Pradeep Kumar stated that he had <lb/>no connection with the said mobile number and does not know the <lb/>applicant. <lb/>S. <lb/>Samples of the substances recovered from the parcel, as well as <lb/>the residence of the applicant, were sent for chemical examination to <lb/>the Central Revenues Control Laboratory, New Delhi [hereinafter, <lb/>&quot;CRCL&quot;]. On examination of the alleged contraband by the CRCL, <lb/>the substance recovered from the parcel was found positive for heroin, <lb/>as was one of the samples from the residence of the applicant. The <lb/></body>

			<body>other sample which was recovered from the house of the applicant was <lb/>found positive for charas. <lb/>3. <lb/>As evident from the above, the applicant has been accused of <lb/>conscious possession of at least 265 grams of heroin (which <lb/>constitutes a commercial quantity), and 175 grams of charas (which <lb/>constitutes an intermediate quantity). Although the prosecution also <lb/>attributes to him the 200 grams of heroin recovered from the parcel <lb/>(which constitutes an intermediate quantity), the accused disputes the <lb/>said possession. In view of the fact that, at the minimum, the case <lb/>against the applicant involves conscious possession of 265 grams of <lb/>heroin, which is a commercial quantity of narcotics under the Act, <lb/>there is no dispute that the rigors of Section 37 of the Act are attracted <lb/>to the present case. <lb/>4. <lb/>The applicant has been in custody in connection with the case <lb/>since 03.06.2014, and remains in custody for a period of eight years. <lb/>5. <lb/>The applicant first approached the Special Court for bail, which <lb/>was rejected on 11.11.2020. The applicant then filed BAIL APPL. <lb/>369/2021 before this Court, which was dismissed as withdrawn on <lb/>22.03.2021, with a direction that the Special Court shall endeavor to <lb/>dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible. <lb/>6. <lb/>While issuing notice in the present application, the Nominal <lb/>Roll of the applicant was also called for from the jail authorities, <lb/>which reveals that, as on 12.05.2022, he had been in custody for a <lb/>period of 7 years 11 months and 9 days. Although his overall conduct <lb/>is characterized as unsatisfactory due to punishments awarded to him <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 8 of 26 <lb/></page>

			<body>on 09.02.2017 and 10.01.2019, his jail conduct during the last one <lb/>year has been certified to be satisfactory. <lb/>7. <lb/>No prior involvement of the applicant in any offence has been <lb/>mentioned in the reply filed by the NCB to the present application. <lb/>8. <lb/>It may be noted that Mr. Ashish Kanojia was not named as an <lb/>accused in the chargesheet, but was subsequently arraigned as an <lb/>accused pursuant to the orders of the Special Court. He was enlarged <lb/>on bail within one year and, according to the Nominal Roll of the <lb/>applicant, Mr. Ashish Kanojia was released on 18.11.2015. <lb/>9. <lb/>As far as the trial is concerned, it appears that out of the 25 <lb/>prosecution witnesses [hereinafter, &quot;PW&quot;] cited in the chargesheet, <lb/>Mr. Ashish Kanojia has been made an accused, 4 PWs have been <lb/>dropped, and 14 out of the remaining 20 PWs have been examined. <lb/>Submissions <lb/>10. Mr. Adarsh Priyadarshi, learned counsel for the applicant, has <lb/>made the following submissions in support of the present application:-<lb/>A. <lb/>Mr. Priyadarshi submitted that the applicant is entitled to be <lb/>enlarged on bail on the ground of prolonged incarceration as an <lb/>undertrial. In support of this argument, he relied upon the judgment of <lb/>the Supreme Court in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee <lb/>(Representing Undertrial Prisoners) vs. Union of India and Others 2 <lb/>[hereinafter, &quot;SCLAC&quot;], wherein the Supreme Court laid down <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 9 of 26 <lb/></page>

			<body>guidelines for release of undertrial prisoners on bail, where the <lb/>accused were facing trial for offences under the Act. Mr. Priyadarshi <lb/>submitted that the said judgment has been noticed by the Supreme <lb/>Court more recently in Thana Singh vs. Central Bureau of Narcotics 3 . <lb/>He also relied upon the interpretation of SCLAC judgment by a <lb/>Division Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in In Re-Sanawar Ali 4 <lb/>and by coordinate benches of this Court in Atul Aggarwal vs. <lb/>Directorate of Revenue Intelligence 5 and in Anil Kumar alias Nillu vs. <lb/>State 6 . Relying upon the aforesaid judgments, Mr. Priyadarshi <lb/>submitted that the applicant, who has been in custody for eight years, <lb/>is entitled to be enlarged on bail on the strength of the SCLAC <lb/>judgment. <lb/>B. <lb/>Mr. Priyadarshi relied upon an order of the Supreme Court in <lb/>Baba Fakruddin Sheikh @ Fakru vs. The State (NCT of Delhi) 7 , <lb/>wherein the applicant therein was denied bail by an order of this Court <lb/>dated 25.03.2021 in Bail Application No. 334/2021, on the finding <lb/>that a commercial quantity of contraband had been recovered, and <lb/>Section 37 of the Act would be attracted. The Supreme Court, <lb/>however, directed the accused to be enlarged on bail, noting in its <lb/>order that the petitioner had suffered incarceration for a period of <lb/>seven years and six months, and that there was no possibility of the <lb/>trial being concluded in the near future. <lb/></body>

			<body>C. <lb/>Mr. Priyadarshi submitted on merits that, even taking into <lb/>account the provisions of Section 37 of the Act, the applicant is <lb/>entitled to be released on bail. He emphasized that, in view of the <lb/>judgment of the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh vs. State of Tamil <lb/>Nadu 8 , the statements of Mr. Ashish Kanojia and the applicant <lb/>himself, recorded under Section 67 of the Act, cannot be read as <lb/>evidence against the applicant. <lb/>D. <lb/>In the absence of any other evidence, Mr. Priyadarshi argued <lb/>that the sampling procedure adopted by the NCB, both with regard to <lb/>the recovery from the parcel at the courier office, and at the residence <lb/>of the applicant, was inconsistent with the prescribed procedures, as <lb/>the substances alleged to have been recovered from different <lb/>packets/tubes were mixed together before drawing samples for <lb/>chemical testing. He argued that the representative character of the <lb/>samples was thus vitiated. In support of this contention, he relied upon <lb/>the judgments of the coordinate benches of this Court in Amani Fidel <lb/>Chris vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 9 , Charlse Howell @ Abel Kom vs. <lb/>NCB 10 , and Mokibe MR Leepile Moses @ Patrick Umechukwu vs. <lb/>Narcotics Control Bureau 11 . <lb/>11. Mr. Shashwat Bansal, learned counsel for the NCB, on the other <lb/>hand, contested the application principally on the following grounds: <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">8 (2021) 4 SCC 1 <lb/>9 Crl Appeal 1027/2015, decided on 13.03.2020 <lb/>10 Crl Appeal 755/2016, decided on 13.08.2018 <lb/>11 Crl Appeal 220/2016, decided on 22.02.2021 <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 997/2022 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 11 of 26 <lb/></page>

			<body>A. <lb/>Mr. Bansal submitted that the SCLAC judgment was expressly <lb/>stated to be a one-time measure, and applicable only to the State of <lb/>Maharashtra. Although the SCLAC judgment was thereafter extended <lb/>to some other states by an order of the Supreme Court in Supreme <lb/>Court Legal Aid Committee (Representing Undertrial Prisoners) vs. <lb/>Union of India and Others 12 , learned counsel emphasized that it was <lb/>not extended to Delhi. <lb/>B. <lb/>In any event, Mr. Bansal submitted that paragraph 16 of the <lb/>SCLAC judgment makes it clear that the directions given therein were <lb/>not intended to restrict the powers of the Special Courts under Section <lb/>37 of the Act. Having regard to the fact that the applicant is not a <lb/>citizen of India, Mr. Bansal submitted that the normal considerations <lb/>applicable to proceedings for bail, including the likelihood that the <lb/>accused would flee from justice or would tamper with the evidence, <lb/>militate against the grant of bail to the applicant in the present case. <lb/>C. <lb/>Mr. Bansal relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in <lb/>Achint Navinbhai Patel alias Mahesh Shah vs. State of Gujarat and <lb/>Anr. 13 , to submit that prolonged incarceration is not always a sufficient <lb/>ground for grant of bail in an offence alleged to have been committed <lb/>under the Act. <lb/>D. <lb/>Mr. Bansal cited the judgment of a coordinate bench of this <lb/>Court in Bobby Collin vs. Narcotic Control Bureau 14 to submit that, in <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 12 of 26 <lb/></page>

			<body>a similar case under the Act, this Court had declined to release the <lb/>applicant on bail, despite incarceration for a period of over six years. <lb/>He pointed out that the Court considered the judgment in Amani Fidel <lb/>Chris 15 , but declined to consider this argument at the stage of bail, <lb/>particularly because only one prosecution witness remained to be <lb/>examined. A similar contention was also considered in Anthony Umeh <lb/>vs. State 16 , Naveed Ummer Sheikh vs. Narcotic Control Bureau <lb/>Through: Shri Mukesh Malik Prosecutor NCB 17 and Bipin Bihari <lb/>Lenka vs. Narcotic Control Bureau 18 . <lb/>E. <lb/>Mr. Bansal relied upon the judgments of this Court in Mohd <lb/>Hanif vs. NCB 19 , Emeka Charles Omuka vs. Narcotic Control <lb/>Bureau 20 and Edwin Emeka Igbowke vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 21 <lb/>to submit that this Court has refused to grant bail to accused alleged to <lb/>have committed offences under the Act wherein the contraband seized <lb/>was in commercial quantity, and that the rigors of Section 37 of the <lb/>Act will be attracted. <lb/>12. In rejoinder, Mr. Priyadarshi submitted that the applicant&apos;s <lb/>citizenship status ought not to detain this Court as the Act makes no <lb/>distinction between accused on the basis of their citizenship. He <lb/>contended that the SCLAC judgment specifically deals with foreigners <lb/>accused under the Act and lays down special safeguards which may be <lb/></body>

			<body>imposed while granting bail to foreign nationals. In the present case, <lb/>he submitted that the chargesheet itself reveals that the applicant is <lb/>married to an Indian citizen, and is ordinarily resident within the <lb/>jurisdiction of this Court. He stated that the applicant and his wife also <lb/>have a young child. Mr. Priyadarshi handed up several orders to the <lb/>Court in which bail was granted to foreigners, including those accused <lb/>of having committed offences under the Act. <lb/>Analysis <lb/>13. At the outset, as noted above, even assuming in favour of the <lb/>applicant that the recovery from the courier parcel cannot be attributed <lb/>to him, the present case concerns recovery of commercial quantity of <lb/>heroin (in addition to an intermediate quantity of charas), and Section <lb/>37 of the Act would thus be applicable. Section 37 of the Act lays <lb/>down the twin tests, which must be satisfied before granting bail in <lb/>such a case, in addition to the normal conditions for grant of bail under <lb/>the CrPC. It provides as follows: <lb/>&quot;37. Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable:-<lb/>(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of <lb/>Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) <lb/>(a) every offence punishable under this Act shall be <lb/>cognizable; <lb/>(b) no person accused of an offence punishable for <lb/>2[offences under section 19 or section 24 or section 27A <lb/>and also for offences involving commercial quantity] <lb/>shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless-<lb/></body>

			<body>(i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an <lb/>opportunity to oppose the application for such <lb/>release, and <lb/>(ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the <lb/>application, the court is satisfied that there are <lb/>reasonable grounds for believing that he is not <lb/>guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to <lb/>commit any offence while on bail. <lb/>(2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause <lb/>(b) of sub-section (1) are in addition to the limitations <lb/>under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) <lb/>or any other law for the time being in force, on granting <lb/>of bail.&quot; <lb/>14. Turning to the question of whether or not the applicant is <lb/>entitled to be released on bail on the ground of prolonged <lb/>incarceration as an undertrial prisoner, the SCLAC judgment is of <lb/>foremost significance in this regard. The petition before the Supreme <lb/>Court was motivated by the delay in disposal of cases under the Act, <lb/>particularly involving foreigners. During the proceedings, the scope <lb/>was expanded to cover all undertrial prisoners who were in jail for <lb/>offences under the Act for a period of over two years. The Court noted <lb/>that, despite the provision for trial before Special Courts under the <lb/>Act, the disposal of cases has taken much longer than originally <lb/>envisioned. The Supreme Court found that the delay in trial, when <lb/>read with the stringent provisions of Section 37 of the Act, render the <lb/>fundamental rights of the accused under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the <lb/>Constitution in jeopardy. Although the Court declined to quash the <lb/>charges against the accused on this basis, it accepted the alternative <lb/>submission that the accused should be released on bail after a certain <lb/></body>

			<body>period of incarceration, if the trial has been delayed beyond a <lb/>reasonable time. The Court categorized the cases according to the <lb/>punishment prescribed for the offence in question. In the case of <lb/>persons accused of offences punishable with minimum imprisonment <lb/>of ten years and a minimum fine of ₹1 lakh, the Court directed that <lb/>they be released on bail if they had been in jail for not less than five <lb/>years, subject to furnishing bail in the sum of ₹1 lakh, with two <lb/>sureties for the like amount. It is not in dispute that this is the <lb/>provision which would be applicable in the present case. <lb/>15. The Supreme Court gave further directions regarding the <lb/>conditions to be imposed while granting bail, which are reproduced <lb/>below:-<lb/>&quot;15-xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx <lb/>xxxx <lb/>The directives in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall be <lb/>subject to the following general conditions: <lb/>(i) The undertrial accused entitled to be released on bail <lb/>shall deposit his passport with the learned Judge of the <lb/>Special Court concerned and if he does not hold a <lb/>passport he shall file an affidavit to that effect in the form <lb/>that may be prescribed by the learned Special Judge. In <lb/>the latter case the learned Special Judge will, if he has <lb/>reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement, write to <lb/>the Passport Officer concerned to verify the statement <lb/>and the Passport Officer shall verify his record and send <lb/>a reply within three weeks. If he fails to reply within the <lb/>said time, the learned Special Judge will be entitled to act <lb/>on the statement of the undertrial accused; <lb/>(ii) the undertrial accused shall on being released on bail <lb/>present himself at the police station which has prosecuted <lb/>him at least once in a month in the case of those covered <lb/>under clause (i), once in a fortnight in the case of those <lb/></body>

			<body>covered under clause (ii) and once in a week in the case <lb/>of those covered by clause (iii), unless leave of absence is <lb/>obtained in advance from the Special Judge concerned; <lb/>(iii) the benefit of the direction in clauses (ii) and (iii) <lb/>shall not be available to those accused persons who are, <lb/>in the opinion of the learned Special Judge, for reasons <lb/>to be stated in writing, likely to tamper with evidence or <lb/>influence the prosecution witnesses; <lb/>(iv) in the case of undertrial accused who are foreigners, <lb/>the Special Judge shall, besides impounding their <lb/>passports, insist on a certificate of assurance from the <lb/>Embassy/High Commission of the country to which the <lb/>foreigner-accused belongs, that the said accused shall <lb/>not leave the country and shall appear before the Special <lb/>Court as and when required; <lb/>(v) the undertrial accused shall not leave the area in <lb/>relation to which the Special Court is constituted except <lb/>with the permission of the learned Special Judge; <lb/>(vi) the undertrial accused may furnish bail by depositing <lb/>cash equal to the bail amount; <lb/>(vii) the Special Judge will be at liberty to cancel bail if <lb/>any of the above conditions are violated or a case for <lb/>cancellation of bail is otherwise made out; and <lb/>(viii) after the release of the undertrial accused pursuant <lb/>to this order, the cases of those undertrials who have not <lb/>been released and are in jail will be accorded priority <lb/>and the Special Court will proceed with them as provided <lb/>in Section 309 of the Code. <lb/>16. We may state that the above are intended to operate <lb/>as one-time directions for cases in which the accused <lb/>persons are in jail and their trials are delayed. They are <lb/>not intended to interfere with the Special Court&apos;s a power <lb/>to grant bail under Section 37 of the Act. The Special <lb/>Court will be free to exercise that power keeping in view <lb/>the complaint of inordinate delay in the disposal of the <lb/>pending cases. The Special Court will, notwithstanding <lb/></body>

			<body>the directions, be free to cancel bail if the accused is <lb/>found to be misusing it and grounds for cancellation of <lb/>bail exist. Lastly, we grant liberty to apply in case of any <lb/>difficulty in the implementation of this order.&quot; <lb/>16. The SCLAC judgment was cited by the Supreme Court in Thana <lb/>Singh 22 to grant bail to an accused under the Act, who was in jail for <lb/>more than 12 years. <lb/>17. Three recent orders of the Supreme Court, also indicate that the <lb/>period of incarceration, and the likelihood of the trial taking a long <lb/>time, are factors to be considered while deciding applications for bail <lb/>in cases instituted under the Act. These orders are as follows:-<lb/>a. <lb/>In Manoj Kumar Singh vs. State of West Bengal &amp; Anr. 23 , the <lb/>applicants therein were accused of transporting 9,310 kilograms of <lb/>ganja while dressed in army uniform and were also carrying firearms. <lb/>The Supreme Court noted the SCLAC judgment, and the fact that the <lb/>proceedings before the trial court remained pending despite several <lb/>directions of the Supreme Court and the High Court. The Court <lb/>released the applicants therein on bail on the ground that they have <lb/>served more than seven years in judicial custody. <lb/>b. <lb/>In Tapan Das vs. Union of India 24 , the Court granted bail to an <lb/>accused noting that he had been in incarceration for around four years, <lb/>and that there was no possibility of completion of the trial in the near <lb/>future. <lb/></body>

			<body>c. <lb/>In Baba Fakruddin Sheikh @ Fakru 25 , cited by Mr. Priyadarshi, <lb/>this Court denied bail, coming to a finding that a commercial quantity <lb/>of contraband had been recovered and Section 37 of the Act would <lb/>thus be attracted. This Court rejected the applicant&apos;s contention that <lb/>the recovery from the applicant alone (and not from other co-accused) <lb/>should be taken into account, which was only of 200 grams of heroin, <lb/>being an intermediate quantity under the Act. It, therefore, rejected the <lb/>application for bail, applying Section 37 of the Act. The Supreme <lb/>Court however granted bail, noting the period of incarceration, and the <lb/>unlikelihood of timely conclusion of the trial. <lb/>18. In Sanawar Ali 26 , a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, <lb/>noticed that the SCLAC judgment has specifically been applied to the <lb/>State of West Bengal. Noting the general rule in favour of grant of <lb/>bail, and coming to a conclusion that the delay in the conclusion of the <lb/>trial was not occasioned by the accused, the High Court granted bail in <lb/>that case. The Division Bench negatived the contention that SCLAC <lb/>judgment was intended to be only a &quot;one-time measure&quot;, which would <lb/>have no applicability in the present time. <lb/>19. Although the SCLAC judgment has not specifically been <lb/>applied to the National Capital Territory of Delhi, the following recent <lb/>decisions of coordinate benches of this Court have applied the <lb/>principles laid down therein by the Supreme Court:-<lb/></body>

			<body>a. <lb/>In Atul Aggarwal 27 , the Court was considering an application <lb/>for bail in a case arising under the Act. The accused had been in <lb/>custody for nine years as an undertrial prisoner. The Court cited the <lb/>SCLAC judgment to release him on bail. <lb/>b. <lb/>In Kartik Dangi vs. State of NCT of Delhi 28 , the Court inter alia <lb/>noticed the decisions of the Supreme Court in SCLAC, Union of India <lb/>vs. K.A. Najeeb 29 , Manoj Kumar Singh 30 and Tapan Das 31 , and the <lb/>judgment of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in <lb/>Sanawar Ali 32 . The Court released the applicant on bail despite the <lb/>allegation of seizure of 12.6 kilograms of opium attracting the <lb/>limitations prescribed in Section 37 of the Act. <lb/>c. <lb/>In Anil Kumar @ Nillu 33 , a similar conclusion was recorded, <lb/>noticing the SCLAC judgment and the judgment of the Calcutta High <lb/>Court in Sanawar Ali 34 . The argument of the prosecution that the <lb/>SCLAC judgment was a one-time measure, was rejected with the <lb/>following observations:-<lb/>&quot;12. A bare perusal of paragraph 16 indicates to this <lb/>Court that the directions were not meant to be employed <lb/>as one-time directions in the said case, but were meant to <lb/>apply as a one-time measure in all cases in which the <lb/>accused persons were in jail and their trials had been <lb/></body>

			<body>delayed. The intention of paragraph 16 was to convey <lb/>that despite the absence or presence of delay in trial in a <lb/>case, the Special Court was still free to exercise its power <lb/>to grant bail under Section 37 of the NDPS Act. <lb/>Furthermore, if the Special Court also retained the power <lb/>to cancel bail if the accused was found to be misusing the <lb/>same. The directions were certainly not, as the learned <lb/>APP has submitted, meant to only apply in the case <lb/>therein, but were directions that were to be followed by <lb/>Courts in all cases pertaining to NDPS wherein the <lb/>accused had been subjected to prolonged delay in their <lb/>trials.&quot; <lb/>d. <lb/>The view taken by this Court in Atul Aggarwal 35 and Anil <lb/>Kumar @ Nillu 36 has been followed in a recent judgment of this Court <lb/>in Ebera Nwanaforo vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 37 and connected <lb/>matter. After a detailed discussion of the judgments of the Supreme <lb/>Court inter alia in SCLAC, and Tofan Singh 38 , as well as the <lb/>judgments of this Court inter alia in Atul Aggarwal 39 and Anil Kumar <lb/>@ Nillu 40 , the Bench concurred with the view taken in Anil Kumar @<lb/>Nillu. The Court noted that neither Atul Aggarwal 41 , nor Anil Kumar <lb/>@ Nillu 42 was carried in appeal by the prosecuting agencies. The<lb/>applicants therein, having been incarcerated for a period of more than <lb/>eight years, were therefore released on bail. This Court expressly <lb/>rejected the argument of the prosecution that the applicants ought not <lb/>to be released on bail as they are foreign nationals, relying upon the <lb/></body>

			<body>judgment of this Court in Lambert Kroger vs. Enforcement <lb/>Directorate 43 . <lb/>20. The judgments on this point which have been cited by Mr. <lb/>Bansal do not deal with the SCLAC judgment. In Bobby Collin 44 , the <lb/>principal ground of rejection of bail was that the trial was at its final <lb/>stage, with only one prosecution witness remaining to be examined. In <lb/>Anthony Umeh 45 , although the accused had been in custody for more <lb/>than five years, the Court found that the case of improper sampling <lb/>was required to be tested during trial and not at the stage of bail. The <lb/>bail application was, therefore, rejected. In Mohd. Hanif 46 , this Court <lb/>rejected the bail application of the accused, who had been in custody <lb/>for about 4 years 9 months on the ground that a previous application <lb/>for bail had already been rejected by this Court. The case of Emeka <lb/>Charles Omuka 47 is also not a case of incarceration for the period as <lb/>laid down in the SCLAC judgment, as the applicant was in judicial <lb/>custody since 27.12.2019, and the judgment was pronounced on <lb/>19.04.2022. In Edwin Emeka Igbowke 48 also, the period of <lb/>incarceration was of just over four years. In any event, as none of the <lb/>judgments cited by Mr. Bansal deal with the SCLAC judgment, I am <lb/>of the view that the recent judgments of coordinate benches of this <lb/></body>

			<body>Court, particularly in Anil Kumar @ Nillu 49 , and Ebera Nwanaforo 50 , <lb/>squarely cover the present case. <lb/>21. The judgment in Achint Navinbhai Patel 51 , cited by Mr. Bansal, <lb/>proceeds on the basis that the petitioners therein were themselves <lb/>responsible, at least partially, for the delay in completion of the trial. <lb/>Although the trial had been pending for eight years, the reasons noted <lb/>by the Supreme Court 52 included the actions of the accused by filing <lb/>repeated petitions on interim matters, including bail applications, <lb/>hearing of such applications at length, and deciding the same by <lb/>elaborate judgments while staying further prosecution by the High <lb/>Court, which contributed to the delay in conclusion of the trial. The <lb/>Supreme Court noted its earlier judgments in Special Courts Bill, <lb/>1978, In Re 53 , and in Ganesh Narayan Hegde vs. S. Bangarappa 54 , and <lb/>the facts of the case to come to the conclusion that dilatory tactics <lb/>were being adopted by the accused. The bail application was, <lb/>therefore, dismissed. In the present case, in contrast, there is no <lb/>assertion or indication in the Status Report that the accused has <lb/>delayed the proceedings of the trial. Therefore, no case is made out of <lb/>dilatory tactics on the part of the applicant, which would furnish a <lb/>ground to make an exception from the principles laid down in the <lb/>SCLAC judgment, and followed by this Court inter alia in Atul <lb/></body>

As far as the legality of the sampling procedure is concerned, <lb/>having regard to the judgment of this Court in Anthony Umeh 59 , and <lb/>the other judgments cited by Mr. Bansal on this point, I accept his <lb/>contention that this question cannot be adjudicated at this stage, and it <lb/>has to be determined at the end of the trial. However, to the extent that <lb/>the prosecution relies upon the extra judicial confessions of the <lb/>accused and of another co-accused, recorded under Section 67 of the <lb/>Act, the judgment of the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh 60 holds that <lb/>such confessions are inadmissible in evidence. This point has been <lb/>considered in several judgments of this Court while granting bail in <lb/>cases under the Act. Reference by way of example may be made to the <lb/>order of this Court in Amans Osaretin vs. Narcotics Control Bureau 61 , <lb/>and the judgment in Ebera Nwanaforo 62 . <lb/>23. The argument of Mr. Bansal that a different consideration <lb/>would apply in the case of foreigners also does not commend to me. <lb/>The judgments noted above in Lambert Kroger 63 and Ebera <lb/>Nwanaforo 64 conclude this issue against the prosecution.

			<body>SCLAC judgment also, the Supreme Court expressly dealt with the <lb/>question of grant of bail to foreigners accused under the Act. In any <lb/>event, in the present case, the undisputed position is that, although the <lb/>applicant himself is a foreign citizen, he is married to a citizen of <lb/>India, and has a child who is also resident in New Delhi. I was <lb/>informed during the course of hearing that his address in Delhi has <lb/>also been verified by the IO. The applicant can, therefore, be seen to <lb/>have roots in the society, despite his citizenship status. <lb/>24. For the reasons aforesaid, as the applicant has been in custody <lb/>for eight years already, six PWs are yet to be examined, and on the <lb/>consideration of the various factors noted above, including the <lb/>provision of Section 37 of the Act, as interpreted in the above <lb/>judgments of the Supreme Court and this Court, I am of the view that <lb/>the applicant is entitled to be released on bail. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>25. It is, therefore, directed that the applicant herein be admitted to <lb/>bail in relation to Sessions Case No. 9080/2016, registered by the <lb/>NCB under Sections 8(c), 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the Act, subject to the <lb/>following conditions:-<lb/>A. <lb/>The applicant will furnish a personal bond in the sum of ₹1 <lb/>lakh, with two sureties in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the <lb/>Special Court/Duty Magistrate. <lb/>B. <lb/>The applicant&apos;s passport will be deposited with the Special <lb/>Court. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">BAIL APPLN. 997/2022 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 25 of 26 <lb/></page>

			<body>C. <lb/>The applicant will present himself at the office of the NCB <lb/>every Monday at 11:00 am, and will be released within one hour after <lb/>completion of the formalities. Exemption from this requirement may <lb/>be granted by the Special Court in exceptional circumstances. <lb/>D. <lb/>The Special Court will seek a certificate of assurance from the <lb/>High Commission of Nigeria, New Delhi, that the accused shall not <lb/>leave the country till the trial is concluded, and shall appear before the <lb/>Special Court on each and every date, unless exempted by the Special <lb/>Court in exceptional circumstances. The applicant will not be released <lb/>on bail in the absence of such a certificate of assurance. <lb/>E. <lb/>The applicant will reside at the address mentioned in the <lb/>chargesheet which has been verified by the IO. In the event of any <lb/>change in his address, the applicant will give prior information of the <lb/>same to the IO and the Special Court. <lb/>F. <lb/>The applicant will give his mobile number to the IO, and ensure <lb/>that the mobile number is kept in working condition, and is <lb/>operational at all times. <lb/>G. <lb/>The applicant will drop a pin on Google Maps to ensure that his <lb/>exact location is available with the IO at all times. <lb/>H. <lb/>The applicant will not tamper with the evidence, directly or <lb/>indirectly, in any manner. <lb/>I. <lb/>The applicant will not contact any of the prosecution witnesses <lb/>or act in any other manner prejudicial to the trial. <lb/></body>

			<body>J. <lb/>In the event any further offence is registered against the <lb/>applicant during the period he is out on bail, the NCB is at liberty to <lb/>apply to the Special Court for cancellation of the bail granted to the <lb/>applicant. <lb/>K. <lb/>The Special Court will also be at liberty to cancel the bail of the <lb/>applicant on account of any violation of the conditions laid down in <lb/>this order. <lb/>26. The Special Court is directed to conclude the trial as <lb/>expeditiously as possible and practicable, and preferably by <lb/>31.12.2022. <lb/>27. It is made clear that the observations made hereinabove are only <lb/>for the purposes of disposal of the present bail application, and will <lb/>not prejudice the parties at trial. <lb/>28. The application stands disposed of with the aforesaid directions. <lb/>29. A copy of this order be communicated electronically forthwith <lb/>to the concerned Jail Superintendent for information. <lb/>PRATEEK JALAN, J <lb/>JUNE 13, 2022 <lb/>&apos;Bhupi/Faisal&apos; </body>
