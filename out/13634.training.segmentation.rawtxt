Iqbal Tanha, a 25 year old student, pursuing his final year of the B.A. 

(Hons.). (Persian) Programme at the Jamia Milia Islamia University, New 

Delhi ('Jamia University', for short) impugns order dated 26.10.2020 made 

by the learned Special Court ('impugned order', for short), whereby the 

appellant's second application seeking enlargement on bail has been 

rejected. 

2. The appellant is presently in judicial custody, having been arrested on 

19.05.2020 in case FIR No. 59/2020 dated 06.03.2020 registered under 

sections 147 / 148 / 149 / 120B Indian Penal Code 1860 ('IPC', for 

short) at P.S.: Crime Branch ('subject FIR', for short) in connection 

with the incidents of violence and rioting that occurred in North-East 

Delhi between 22.02.2020 and 26.02.2020. It may be noted that 

offences under sections 109 / 114 / 124A / 153A / 186 / 201 / 212 / 

295 / 302 / 307 / 341 /353 / 395 / 419 / 420 / 427 / 435 / 436 / 452 / 454 

/ 468 / 471 / 34 IPC, sections 3 / 4 of the Prevention of Damage to 

Public Property Act, 1984 ('PDPP Act', for short), sections 25 / 26 of 

Arms Act, 1959 and sections 13 / 16 / 17 / 18 of the Unlawful 

Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 ('UAPA', for short) were 

subsequently added to the subject FIR. At the time of his arrest in the 

subject FIR on 19.05.2020, the appellant was already in judicial 

custody in a different case arising from FIR No. 298/2019 dated 

16.12.2019 registered under sections 143 / 147 / 148 / 149 / 435 / 427 / 

323 / 186 / 353 / 332 / 308 / 341 / 120B / 34 IPC and sections 3 / 4 of 

the PDPP Act at P.S.: Jamia Nagar, New Delhi. For completeness it 

may be mentioned that FIR No. 298/2019 was registered in connection 

with protests held in Delhi in 2019 against the Citizenship 

CRL.A. 39/2021

2 133 


(Amendment) Act 2019 ('CAA', for short) passed by the Parliament 

and the exercise proposed to be undertaken by the Central Government 

for creating a National Register of Citizens ('NRC', for short). It must 

be mentioned that in case FIR No. 298/2019 the appellant has since 

been admitted to regular bail by the learned Sessions Court, Saket, New 

Delhi. 

3. Charge-sheet dated 16.09.2020 has been filed in the subject FIR inter 

alia against the appellant ('subject charge-sheet', for short); and though 

supplementary charge-sheets dated 22.11.2020 and 01.03.2021 have 

also been filed in the subject FIR, the said other charge-sheets do not 

relate to the appellant and are therefore not relevant for purposes of the 

present proceedings. Vidé order dated 17.09.2020 the learned Special 

Court has taken cognizance of the offences alleged in the subject 

charge-sheet except offences under sections 124A / 153A / 109 / 120B 

of the IPC, since requisite sanction for prosecution from the State 

Government was awaited for those offences as of the date of the 

impugned order. Charges have not yet been framed against the 

appellant. 

4. In a Criminal Miscellaneous Petition bearing CRL.M.C. No. 2119/2020 

filed by the respondent/State against order of the trial court directing 

the State to provide a hardcopy of the charge-sheet to all accused 

persons, further proceedings in the trial before the learned Special

Essence of allegations against Appellant & 

role assigned to him 

5. The essential allegations against the appellant as contained in the 

subject charge-sheet as also set-out in reply dated 24.07.2020 filed by 

the Special Cell, Delhi Police before the learned Special Court 

opposing the appellant's bail application are the following : 

a) 
that the appellant is one of the main conspirators as well as 

instigators behind the riots that happened in the North-East 

parts of Delhi from 22.02.2020 to 26.02.2020; that the appellant 

played an active role in the conspiracy and is one of the 

'masterminds'; 

b) 
that the appellant is a member of the Student Islamic 

Organisation ('SIO', for short); 

c) 
that on 13.12.2019, a protest was held at Gate No. 7 of Jamia 

University and the appellant, alongwith other co-accused 

persons, formed the Jamia Co-ordination Committee ('JCC', for 

short). The JCC was formed to protest against the CAA; 

d) 
that on 17.12.2019, a WhatsApp group of the JCC was formed 

to monitor, control and manage the protest sites in Delhi; and 

the office of the JCC was set-up in a room at Gate No. 18 of 

Jamia University; 

e) 
that at a meeting of members of the JCC and representatives of 

another entity called 'Pinjra Tod', it was decided to hold a 

chakkajam in North-East Delhi (chakkajam being loosely 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
4 133 


translatable as a form of protest in which protesters cause 

complete stoppage of vehicles and blockade of roads); 

f) 
that as part of the conspiracy, women and children were 

mobilized to prevent the police from using force against them; 

g) 
that for the foregoing purposes, the co-conspirators gave 

directions to the appellant; and the appellant, alongwith other 

co-accused persons ratified them; 

h) 
that the appellant provided a SIM card to one of the co-accused, 

in the office of the JCC, using which the latter posted directions 

and instructions on the JCC WhatsApp group; 

i) 
that co-accused persons instructed the appellant to visit Muslim 

majority and Muslim dominated areas for campaigning as part 

of the protest; and the appellant was also instructed to co-

ordinate with local Imams to mobilize people for the protest; 

j) 
that on 22.02.2020, an urgent meeting of the JCC was called at 

the Jafrabad Metro Station while the road there was blocked; at 

which meeting the appellant said that he had spoken to other 

co-accused persons, who had told the appellant that 

preparations for riots "were ready". Furthermore, the appellant 

had also said at that meeting that other co-accused persons had 

told him that they were prepared and ready for riots "if anything 

happens"; 

k) 
that as per plan, on 23.02.2020 messages relating to urgent 

mobilisation were posted on the JCC WhatsApp group, after 

which riots occurred in Delhi; 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
5 133 


l) 

that active members of the JCC were responsible for the riots 

that occurred in Delhi, as per a well designed conspiracy; 

m) 
that the appellant, alongwith other co-accused persons, was an 

active radical member of the JCC; 

n) 
that the motive of the JCC was to create riots, which led to the 

death of several people in Delhi; 

o) 
that from the evidence collected so far, there remains no doubt 

that the appellant played a key part in the conspiracy, whereby 

he organised mobilisation of a mob of a particular community, 

thereby flaring-up communal passion and instigated them to 

commit violence; while simultaneously other co-conspirators 

were "actually collecting and organising the means and 

material" through which the mob was to indulge in violence and 

rioting; and 

p) 
that it is clear that the case pertains to a very deep-rooted and 

sinister conspiracy conceived and executed by the appellant to 

create unrest in the society and to uproot a lawfully constituted 

government by employing unconstitutional and violent means; 

q) 
that the appellant's role in relation to the foregoing "has been 

described in great detail by the witnesses" in their statements 

recorded under sections 161 and 164 of the Cr.P.C. 

In the aforesaid reply to the appellant's bail application before 

the learned Special Court, the respondent has also said that : "it is 

learned that funds were sent by Jamia and terrorist for protest".

6. The subject charge-sheet dated 16.09.2020 which relates to the 

appellant is stated to run into some 19000 pages. The portions of the 

subject charge-sheet that are alleged to contain specific allegations 

against the appellant, as referred to by the learned Additional Solicitor 

General appearing for the Delhi Police (Special Cell), are extracted in a 

separate Annexure to this judgment for ease of reference. 

Genesis of UAPA 

7. The genesis of The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 lies in 

the recommendations of the Committee on National Integration and 

Regionalisation set-up by the National Integration Council to look inter 

alia into the aspect of putting reasonable restrictions on certain 

freedoms in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India. As 

reflected in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the UAPA, it was 

pursuant to the recommendations of the said committee that the 

Parliament enacted the Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act 1963 

to impose reasonable restrictions in the interests of sovereignty and 

integrity of India on: 

(i) the freedom of speech and expression; 

(ii) the right to assemble peacefully and without arms; and 

(iii) the right to form associations and unions. 

8. Pursuant thereto, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Bill was 

introduced in the Parliament to make powers available for dealing with 

activities directed against the sovereignty and integrity of India, which 

bill came on the statute book as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) 

Act 1967 ('UAPA', for short) w.e.f. 30.12.1967.

Enactment & Amendment of UAPA & Legislative 
Competence 

9. The Preamble to the UAPA as originally enacted read as follows : 

"An Act to provide for the more effective prevention of certain 
unlawful activities of individuals and associations and for matters 
connected therewith". 

10. In 2004, the Preamble to the UAPA was amended and 'terrorist 

activities' were brought within its fold by amending the Preamble and 

long-title with retrospective effect from 21.09.2004. The amended 

Preamble reads as under: 

"An Act to provide for the more effective prevention of certain 
unlawful activities of individuals and associations, and dealing with 
terrorist activities and for matters connected therewith". 

(emphasis supplied) 

11. Subsequently, in order to give effect to certain resolutions passed by the 

Security Council of the United Nations and to give effect to the 

Prevention and Suppression of the Terrorism (Implementation of 

Security Council Resolution) Order 2007 and to make special provision 

for prevention of, and for coping with, terrorist activities and for 

matters connected therewith or incidental thereto, the UAPA was 

further amended in 2008 inter alia by substituting the then existing 

section 15 relating to 'terrorist act' under the UAPA. 

12. At this point it will be relevant to allude briefly to Article 246 of the 

Constitution of India and the three Lists set-out in the Seventh 

Schedule to the Constitution. Put very briefly, Article 246 sets-out the 

legislative competence of the Parliament and of the State Legislatures 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
8 133 


under the scheme of our Constitution; and says that the Parliament has 

exclusive power to make laws with respect to any matter enumerated in 

List-I appearing in the Seventh Schedule which is called the 'Union 

List', that the State Legislature has exclusive powers to make laws for 

such State with respect to any matter enumerated in List-II of the 

Seventh Schedule, called the 'State List'; and that the Parliament and 

the State Legislature have concurrent powers to make laws with respect 

to matters enumerated in List-III of the Seventh Schedule, called the 

'Concurrent List'. In the context of the present matter, what is to be 

noticed is that the UAPA has been enacted by Parliament and must 

therefore have been enacted in relation to a matter appearing in Entry 1 

and/or Entry 93 of List-I, namely the Union List in the Seventh 

Schedule of the Constitution since no other legislative subject appears 

to cover the enactment of the UAPA. Entries 1 and 93 of List-I read as 

under: 

"! 
SEVENTH SCHEDULE ! 

[Article 246] 

List I -Union List 

1. Defence of India and every part thereof including preparation for 
defence and all such acts as may be conducive in times of war to its 
prosecution and after its termination to effective demobilisation. 

* * * * * 

93. Offences against laws with respect to any of the matters in this 
List." 

13. It further requires to be noticed that Entry 1 of List-II refers to matters 

of 'public order', which subject therefore falls within the legislative 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
9 133 


competence of the State Legislature; and Entry 1 of List-III relates to 

matters of 'criminal law', including all matters included in the IPC but 

excluding offences against laws with respect to any matter specified in 

List-I or List-II and excluding the use of Naval, Military, Air Force or 

any other Armed Forces of the Union. The purpose of referring to Entry 

1 of List-I (Defence of India) and Entry 2 of List-II (Public Order) is to 

take notice of the fact that since UAPA is a central legislation, it would 

have been enacted in relation to the 'defence of India' as contra-

distinct from 'public order', since it must be presumed that when the 

Parliament enacted the UAPA, it was acting within the scope of its 

powers under the constitutional scheme and was therefore enacting a 

legislation relating to a matter that was within its competence under 

Article 246 and the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. 

14. Post the amendments made from time-to-time, as of date, the 

provisions of the UAPA that are relevant for the purposes of the present 

matter are extracted below : 

"2. Definitions.-(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise

Construction of bail provisions under similar 
legislations 

15. Before we examine the provision relating to bail under UAPA, it would 

benefit if we briefly examine the bail provisions under other similar 

statutes. Grant of bail has been restricted and stringent conditions have 

been engrafted for admitting accused persons on bail under several 

other legislations relating to serious offences. It would be useful at this 

point to allude to the construction placed by the courts upon such 

provisions. A comparative chart of the bail provisions under such 

comparable legislations is given as Annexure -A to this judgment. 

Bail under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances Act 1985 ('NDPS Act') 

16. Interpreting section 37 of the NDPS Act, in State of Kerala & Ors. vs. 

1 

Rajesh & Ors. , the Hon'ble Supreme Court says: 

2 

"20. The expression "reasonable grounds" means something more 
than prima facie grounds. It contemplates substantial probable 
causes for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged 
offence. The reasonable belief contemplated in the provision 
requires existence of such facts and circumstances as are 
sufficient in themselves to justify satisfaction that the accused is 
not guilty of the alleged offence. In the case on hand, the High Court 
seems to have completely overlooked the underlying object of 
Section 37 that in addition to the limitations provided under the 
CrPC, or any other law for the time being in force, regulating the 
grant of bail, its liberal approach in the matter of bail under the 
NDPS Act is indeed uncalled for."

17. In Union of India vs. Shiv Shanker Kesari , the Hon'ble Supreme 

3 

Court has said : 

"7. The expression used in Section 37(1)(b)(ii) is "reasonable 
grounds". The expression means something more than prima facie 
grounds. It connotes substantial probable causes for believing that 
the accused is not guilty of the offence charged and this reasonable 
belief contemplated in turn points to existence of such facts and 
circumstances as are sufficient in themselves to justify recording 
of satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the offence charged. 

"8. The word "reasonable" has in law the prima facie meaning of 
reasonable in regard to those circumstances of which the actor, 
called on to act reasonably, knows or ought to know. It is difficult to 
give an exact definition of the word "reasonable". 

""7. … In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 4th Edn., p. 
2258 states that it would be unreasonable to expect an 
exact definition of the word 'reasonable'. Reason varies 
in its conclusions according to the idiosyncrasy of the 
individual, and the times and circumstances in which he 
thinks. The reasoning which built up the old scholastic 
logic sounds now like the jingling of a child's toy." 

(See Municipal Corpn. of Delhi v. Jagan Nath Ashok 
Kumar [(1987) 4 SCC 497] (SCC p. 504, para 7) and 
Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board v. Unique 
Erectors (Gujarat) (P) Ltd. [(1989) 1 SCC 532] 

"9. It is often said that 'an attempt to give a specific meaning to the 
word "reasonable" is trying to count what is not number and 
measure what is not space'. The author of Words and Phrases 
(Permanent Edn.) has quoted from Nice & Schreiber, In re [123 F 
987 at p. 988] to give a plausible meaning for the said word. He 
says 'the expression "reasonable" is a relative term, and the facts 
of the particular controversy must be considered before the 

(2007) 7 SCC 798. 

3 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
16 133 


question as to what constitutes reasonable can be determined'. It is 
not meant to be expedient or convenient but certainly something 
more than that." [Ed.: As observed in Rena Drego v. Lalchand 
Soni, (1998) 3 SCC 341, p. 346, para 9.] 

"10. The word "reasonable" signifies "in accordance with 
reason". In the ultimate analysis it is a question of fact, whether a 
particular act is reasonable or not depends on the circumstances in 
a given situation. (See Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai v. 
Kamla Mills Ltd. [(2003) 6 SCC 315] ) 

"11. The court while considering the application for bail with 
reference to Section 37 of the Act is not called upon to record a 
finding of not guilty. It is for the limited purpose essentially 
confined to the question of releasing the accused on bail that the 
court is called upon to see if there are reasonable grounds for 
believing that the accused is not guilty and records its satisfaction 
about the existence of such grounds. But the court has not to 
consider the matter as if it is pronouncing a judgment of acquittal 
and recording a finding of not guilty."

Bail under Terrorist & Disruptive Activities 
(Prevention) Act 1987 ('TADA') 

18. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has interpreted section 20(8) TADA in 

4 

State of Maharashtra vs. Anand Chintaman Dighe , in the following 

5 

words : 

"5. Sub-section (8) of Section 20 of the Act clearly provides that 
unless the court is satisfied for the reasons to be recorded that there 
are reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent is not 
involved in disruptive activities, bail shall ordinarily be refused. 

cf. Annexure-A to judgment.

Even under the provisions of Sections 437 and 438 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, the powers of the Sessions Judge are not 
unfettered. The salient principles in granting bail in grave crimes 
have not been taken note of. 

* * * * * 

"7. There are no hard and fast rules regarding grant or refusal of 
bail, each case has to be considered on its own merits. The matter 
always calls for judicious exercise of discretion by the court. Where 
the offence is of serious nature the court has to decide the question 
of grant of bail in the light of such considerations as the nature and 
seriousness of offence, character of the evidence, circumstances 
which are peculiar to the accused, a reasonable possibility of 
presence of the accused not being secured at the trial and the 
reasonable apprehension of witness being tampered with, the larger 
interest of the public or such similar other considerations." 

(emphasis supplied) 

19. A Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kartar Singh 

vs. State of Punjab , while inter alia determining the constitutional 

6 

validity of Section 20(8) of TADA, held: 

"341. The learned Additional Solicitor General attempts to meet the 
above arguments stating that there is no question of 
unconstitutionality of the provision and in fact, the conditions 
imposed under clause (b) of sub-section (8) is in consonance with 
the requirements prescribed under clauses (i) and (ii) of sub-section 
(1) of Section 437 and clause (b) of sub-section (3) of that section. 
In any event, according to him, the conduct of an accused seeking 
bail in the context of his background and the nature of crime 
committed are to be evaluated before the concession of bail can be 
granted and that the evaluation is fundamentally from the point of 
view of his likelihood of either tampering with the evidence or

unleashing a threat to the society during the period when he may 
be allowed to be on bail. He also quotes another observation of 
Krishna Iyer, J. in Gudikanti [(1978) 1 SCC 240] in support of his 
submission which reads : (SCC p. 245, para 12) 

"All deprivation of liberty is validated by social defence 
and individual correction along an anti-criminal 
direction. Public justice is central to the whole scheme 
of bail law. Fleeing justice must be forbidden but 
punitive harshness should be minimised. … No seeker 
of justice shall play confidence tricks on the court or 
community." 

* * * * * 

"352. It is true that on many occasions, we have come across cases 
wherein the prosecution unjustifiably invokes the provisions of the 
TADA Act with an oblique motive of depriving the accused persons 
from getting bail and in some occasions when the courts are 
inclined to grant bail in cases registered under ordinary criminal 
law, the investigating officers in order to circumvent the authority 
of the courts invoke the provisions of the TADA Act. This kind of 
invocation of the provisions of TADA in cases, the facts of which 
do not warrant, is nothing but sheer misuse and abuse of the Act 
by the police. Unless, the public prosecutors rise to the occasion 
and discharge their onerous responsibilities keeping in mind that 
they are prosecutors on behalf of the public but not the police and 
unless the Presiding Officers of the Designated Courts discharge 
their judicial functions keeping in view the fundamental rights 
particularly of the personal right and liberty of every citizen as 
enshrined in the Constitution to which they have been assigned 
the role of sentinel on the qui vive, it cannot be said that the 
provisions of TADA Act are enforced effectively in consonance 
with the legislative intendment."

Bail under Maharashtra Control of Organised 
Crime Act 1999 ('MCOCA') 

20. Dealing with section 21 MCOCA, which is the bail provision under 

7 

that statute, in State of Maharashtra vs. Vishwanath Maranna Shetty , 

8 

the Hon'ble Supreme Court holds : 

"30. The analysis of the relevant provisions of MCOCA, similar 
provision in the NDPS Act and the principles laid down in both the 
decisions shows that substantial probable cause for believing that 
the accused is not guilty of the offence for which he is charged 
must be satisfied. Further, a reasonable belief provided points to 
existence of such facts and circumstances as are sufficient to justify 
the satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence. 
We have already highlighted the materials placed in the case on 
hand and we hold that the High Court has not satisfied the twin tests 
as mentioned above while granting bail."

Gopal , as follows : 

11

not decide the merits of the matter. Of course, a prima facie view 
has to be formed in the court in order to satisfy itself that there are

grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of committing the

be based on very cogent material. The High Court has relied on 
alleged discrepancies of the description of the weapon. One must 
keep in mind that the articles recovered have been sent to the court 
and are in custody of the court. It must also be noted that the first of 
the documents, relied upon by the High Court was in Tamil 
language. The other documents are in English. Some police officer 
has translated it from Tamil to English. If some police officer 
wrongly translates the type of weapon one cannot conclude with any 
reasonable certainty that there was no recovery. It is to be seen that 
under Section 4 mere possession not just of an arm but also of an 
ammunition, is sufficient. Ammunition has also been allegedly 
recovered. There is no discrepancy in the description of the 
ammunition. Thus, at this stage it is difficult to sustain the finding of 
the High Court that due to the discrepancies in the description of 
weapon the non-existence of recovery was so probable that the 
Court could act on the supposition that the recovery did not exist.

"14. Further, when bail is granted the court has to ensure that the 
accused would not abscond and/or that he would not tamper with 
the evidence or witnesses. The High Court does not seem to have 
applied its mind to this aspect at all. It has not adverted to these 
matters and made no provisions in respect thereof. 

(emphasis supplied) 

22. In Paza Neduraman and Ors vs. State , a Division Bench of the 

12 

Madras High Court has said this : 

"6. The language of sub-section (6) of Sec. 49 of POTA, however, 
only suggests that a person accused of an offence punishable under 
this Act (POTA) shall not be released on bail or on his own bond 

(2003) SCC OnLine Mad 166.

unless the Public Prosecutor is heard by the court. This subsection 
is also being read by the Prosecution as a repository of the power to 
grant bail because of the peculiar language thereof which presumes 
the existence of such a power. The only additional condition added 
by the subsection is the requirement of giving an opportunity to the 
Public Prosecutor before the order of release on bail or on bond is 
passed. Sub-section (7), however, is a departure from the normal 
rule in the sense that it heightens the burden on the defence. The 
language suggests that where the Public Prosecutor opposes the 
bail application, such accused could not be released on bail until 
the Court is satisfied that there are grounds for believing that he is 
innocent. The plain meaning would be that instead of showing 
that there is no prima facie case against him for his conviction, the 
accused would have to show that there is a prima facie case for his 
acquittal. Then comes the questioned proviso which suggests that 
after the expiry of one year from the date of detention of the 
accused, the provisions of sub-section (6) of Sec. 49 shall apply. We 
shall go to the other provisions later on but, at this juncture, it 
would be better to see the logic applied by the Special Court. 

* * * * * 

"8. … The language of sub-section (7) is complementary to 
subsection (6). It suggests that where during such hearing the Public 
Prosecutor opposes the bail application of the accused then, it 
would have to be shown to the Court and the Court would have to be 
satisfied that there exists some material or ground suggesting that 
the accused is not guilty of committing such offence. Plainly 
speaking, it would be for the defence to plead and prove to the 
satisfaction of the Court a prima facie case for acquittal.

Bail under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 
('UAPA') 

23. Opining specifically on section 43D(5) of the UAPA, in its seminal and 

recent verdict in National Investigation Agency vs. Zahoor Ahmad 

Shah Watali , ('Watali', for short) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has 

13 

said this: 

"23. By virtue of the proviso to sub-section (5), it is the duty of the 
Court to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for 
believing that the accusation against the accused is prima facie 
true or otherwise. Our attention was invited to the decisions of this 
Court, which has had an occasion to deal with similar special 
provisions in TADA and MCOCA. The principle underlying those 
decisions may have some bearing while considering the prayer for 
bail in relation to the offences under the 1967 Act as well. Notably, 
under the special enactments such as TADA, MCOCA and the 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, the Court is 
required to record its opinion that there are reasonable grounds for 
believing that the accused is "not guilty" of the alleged offence. 
There is a degree of difference between the satisfaction to be 
recorded by the Court that there are reasonable grounds for 
believing that the accused is "not guilty" of such offence and the 
satisfaction to be recorded for the purposes of the 1967 Act that 
there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation 
against such person is "prima facie" true. By its very nature, the 
expression "prima facie true" would mean that the materials/ 
evidence collated by the investigating agency in reference to the 
accusation against the accused concerned in the first information 
report, must prevail until contradicted and overcome or disproved 
by other evidence, and on the face of it, shows the complicity of 
such accused in the commission of the stated offence. It must be 
good and sufficient on its face to establish a given fact or the 

(2019) 5 SCC 1. 

13 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
23 133 


chain of facts constituting the stated offence, unless rebutted or 
contradicted. In one sense, the degree of satisfaction is lighter 
when the Court has to opine that the accusation is "prima facie 
true", as compared to the opinion of the accused "not guilty" of 
such offence as required under the other special enactments. In 
any case, the degree of satisfaction to be recorded by the Court for 
opining that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the 
accusation against the accused is prima facie true, is lighter than 
the degree of satisfaction to be recorded for considering a discharge 
application or framing of charges in relation to offences under the 
1967 Act. Nevertheless, we may take guidance from the exposition in 
Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma [(2005) 5 SCC 294], wherein a 
three-Judge Bench of this Court was called upon to consider the 
scope of power of the Court to grant bail… 

"24. A priori, the exercise to be undertaken by the Court at this 
stage-of giving reasons for grant or non-grant of bail-is 
markedly different from discussing merits or demerits of the 
evidence. The elaborate examination or dissection of the evidence is 
not required to be done at this stage. The Court is merely expected 
to record a finding on the basis of broad probabilities regarding 
the involvement of the accused in the commission of the stated 
offence or otherwise. 

"25. From the analysis of the impugned judgment [Zahoor Ahmad 
Shah Watali v. NIA, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 11185], it appears to us 
that the High Court has ventured into an area of examining the 
merits and demerits of the evidence. For, it noted that the evidence 
in the form of statements of witnesses under Section 161 are not 
admissible. Further, the documents pressed into service by the 
investigating agency were not admissible in evidence. It also noted 
that it was unlikely that the document had been recovered from the 
residence of Ghulam Mohammad Bhatt till 16-8-2017 (para 61 of 
the impugned judgment). Similarly, the approach of the High Court 
in completely discarding the statements of the protected witnesses 
recorded under Section 164 CrPC, on the specious ground that the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
24 133 


same was kept in a sealed cover and was not even perused by the 
Designated Court and also because reference to such statements 
having been recorded was not found in the charge-sheet already 
filed against the respondent is, in our opinion, in complete disregard 
of the duty of the Court to record its opinion that the accusation 
made against the accused concerned is prima facie true or 
otherwise. That opinion must be reached by the Court not only in 
reference to the accusation in the FIR but also in reference to the 
contents of the case diary and including the charge-sheet (report 
under Section 173 CrPC) and other material gathered by the 
investigating agency during investigation. 

"26. Be it noted that the special provision, Section 43-D of the 1967 
Act, applies right from the stage of registration of FIR for the 
offences under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act until the 
conclusion of the trial thereof. To wit, soon after the arrest of the 
accused on the basis of the FIR registered against him, but before 
filing of the charge-sheet by the investigating agency; after filing of 
the first charge-sheet and before the filing of the supplementary or 
final charge-sheet consequent to further investigation under Section 
173(8) CrPC, until framing of the charges or after framing of the 
charges by the Court and recording of evidence of key witnesses, 
etc. However, once charges are framed, it would be safe to assume 
that a very strong suspicion was founded upon the materials 
before the Court, which prompted the Court to form a presumptive 
opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting 
the offence alleged against the accused, to justify the framing of 
charge. In that situation, the accused may have to undertake an 
arduous task to satisfy the Court that despite the framing of 
charge, the materials presented along with the charge-sheet 
(report under Section 173 CrPC), do not make out reasonable 
grounds for believing that the accusation against him is prima 
facie true. Similar opinion is required to be formed by the Court 
whilst considering the prayer for bail, made after filing of the first 
report made under Section 173 of the Code, as in the present case. 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
25 133 


"27. For that, the totality of the material gathered by the 
investigating agency and presented along with the report and 
including the case diary, is required to be reckoned and not by 
analysing individual pieces of evidence or circumstance. In any 
case, the question of discarding the document at this stage, on the 
ground of being inadmissible in evidence, is not permissible. For, 
the issue of admissibility of the document/evidence would be a 
matter for trial. The Court must look at the contents of the 
document and take such document into account as it is. 

* * * * * 

"30. In our opinion, the High Court, having noticed that the 
Designated Court had not looked at the stated statements presented 
in a sealed cover, coupled with the fact that the application under 
Section 44 filed by the investigating agency was pending before the 
Designated Court, and before finally answering the prayer for grant 
of bail, should have directed the Designated Court to first decide the 
said application and if allowed, consider the redacted statements, to 
form its opinion as to whether there are reasonable grounds for 
believing that the accusation made against the respondent is prima 
facie true or otherwise. For, in terms of Section 43-D, it is the 
bounden duty of the Court to peruse the case diary and/or the 
report made under Section 173 of the Code and all other relevant 
material/evidence produced by the investigating agency, for 
recording its opinion. 

* * * * * 

"47. The fact that there is a high burden on the accused in terms of 
the special provisions contained in Section 43-D(5) to demonstrate 
that the prosecution has not been able to show that there exist 
reasonable grounds to show that the accusation against him is 
prima facie true, does not alter the legal position expounded in K. 
Veeraswami [(1991) 3 SCC 655], to the effect that the charge-sheet 
need not contain detailed analysis of the evidence. It is for the 
Court considering the application for bail to assess the material/ 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
26 133 


evidence presented by the investigating agency along with the 
report under Section 173 CrPC in its entirety, to form its opinion as 
to whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the 
accusation against the named accused is prima facie true or 
otherwise." 

(emphasis supplied) 

24. Harmonising the power to grant bail on considerations of violation of 

Part-III of the Constitution with the restrictions imposed by UAPA and 

explaining that the nature of section 43D(5) UAPA is less stringent than 

that of section 37 NDPS, in Union of India vs. K.A. Najeeb , a 3-

14 

Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court says: 

"17. …at commencement of proceedings, the courts are expected to 
appreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours 
of such provisions will melt down where there is no likelihood of 
trial being completed within a reasonable time and the period of 
incarceration already undergone has exceeded a substantial part of 
the prescribed sentence… 

* * * * * 

"19. Yet another reason which persuades us to enlarge the 
Respondent on bail is that Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA is 
comparatively less stringent than Section 37 of the NDPS Act. 
Unlike the NDPS where the competent court needs to be satisfied 
that prima facie the accused is not guilty and that he is unlikely to 
commit another offence while on bail; there is no such pre-condition 
under the UAPA. Instead, Section 43-D(5) of UAPA merely provides 
another possible ground for the competent Court to refuse bail, in 
addition to the well-settled considerations like gravity of the 
offence, possibility of tampering with evidence, influencing the 

(2021) 3 SCC 713.

witnesses or chance of the accused evading the trial by absconsion 
etc." 

(emphasis supplied) 

Appellant's Submissions 

25. Mr. Siddharth Aggarwal, learned counsel for the appellant has 

principally made the following submissions: 

(i) 
It is submitted that the subject FIR viz. FIR No. 59/2020 dated 

06.03.2020 registered at P.S.: Crime Branch was initially 

registered under sections 147 / 148 / 149 / 120B IPC, which are 

all bailable offences. Subsequently however, on 19.04.2020 

offences under the UAPA were added to the subject FIR; 

investigation in which is also now complete and subject charge-

sheet dated 16.09.2020 has now been filed naming 15 accused 

persons in such charge-sheet. 

(ii) 
It is submitted that on a perusal of the subject charge-sheet 

alongwith other material on which the prosecution relies, 

including statements of witnesses (some of which are protected 

witnesses) recorded under sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C., will 

show that even prima facie no offence is made-out against the 

appellant that would warrant his continued custody; 

(iii) 
It is further submitted that in any event, no offence under 

section 15 of the UAPA, which defines "Terrorist Act" nor any 

offence under section 18 which defines "Punishment for 

Conspiracy, etc." or any offence engrafted in Chapter IV and/or 

Chapter VI is made-out against the appellant. Consequently, the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
28 133 


stringent provisions contained in section 43D(5) of the UAPA 

against grant of bail are not attracted at all; 

(iv) 
In the alternative it is submitted, that though the material on 

record does not even make-out the offence of engaging in any 

unlawful activity as defined in section 2(1)(o) and as punishable 

under section 13 of UAPA, even assuming that that issue is 

debatable, the harsh provisions against release on bail under 

section 43D(5) have no application to an offence punishable 

under section 13, since it falls under Chapter III of UAPA; 

(v) 
Insofar as the allegations of an offence under section 124A IPC 

are concerned, it is submitted that serious as these allegations 

may be, they are still only to be dealt with under the ordinary 

penal law and do not take the matter into the scope and ambit of 

UAPA; and therefore section 43D(5) UAPA has no application. 

26. To flesh-out his submissions, Mr. Aggarwal has drawn the attention of 

this court to certain portions of the subject charge-sheet, which portions 

are essentially the same as those referred to by the learned ASG, which 

are extracted and discussed below in this judgment. 

Respondent's Submissions 

27. Written Submissions dated 22.03.2021 have been filed on behalf of the 

respondent/Delhi Police, summarising the arguments made by Mr. 

Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on their 

behalf, which are detailed herein below. Dealing with the role of the 

appellant in the offences alleged, the learned ASG has relied upon 

certain portions of the subject FIR and the subject charge-sheet, which 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
29 133 


are extracted as screenshots in Annexure -B to this judgment for ease 

of reference. 

(i) 
That considering the "totality of evidence, including the 

statements of the protected witnesses, the documentary 

evidence and other evidences collected", the complicity of the 

appellant in the offences of which he is accused is prima facie 

established, within the meaning of section 43D(5) UAPA. It is 

urged that the test to justify rejection of bail is whether on the 

evidence available it is possible to arrive at the conclusion that 

the case against the appellant is prima facie true. It is not the 

purport of a bail proceeding that evidence be weighed and 

benefit of doubt be given to the appellant. 

(ii) 
It is argued that the present case is one of "serious disturbance 

of public order undermining security of state" as distinguished 

from one directed against the individuals, and the acts in their 

degree, extent and reach justifying the invocation of the 

provisions under which the appellant is accused. Moreover, it is 

submitted that the "context and circumstances in which the acts 

were committed would clearly cause reactions affecting not 

merely specific individuals but disorders of most extreme 

gravity". 

(iii) 
It has been argued that a communally surcharged environment 

was deliberately created by the conspirators, sharply dividing 

the religious communities hardening cleavages and eliminating 

any possibility of consensus, apart from disavowing all belief in 

the efficacy and worth of the existing system and portraying the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
30 133 


political establishment as inimical to a religious community. 

Having roused sentiments and having created a sense of 

insecurity, the "likelihood that any act or disorder would have 

the potential of tumultuous consequences could not only be 

foreseen but it is apparent that the conspirators desired these 

consequences"; and the intent to disrupt the unity and strike 

terror is obvious. Not merely physical and mental damage but 

prolonged psychological effect was produced affecting the 

society as a whole, disturbing its even tempo and tranquility 

and creating a general sense of fear and insecurity. 

(iv) 
Relying upon Kartar Singh (supra), it has been submitted that 

the proviso to section 43D(5) UAPA bars release on bail if, on 

perusal of the case diary or report under section 173 Cr.P.C., the 

court is of the opinion that there are "reasonable grounds for 

believing that the accusations against such persons are prima 

facie true"; and that the source of the power of the Special 

Court to grant bail is not in section 43D(5) UAPA which only 

places limitations on the grant of bail is referable to section 437 

Cr.P.C. since the Special Court is a Court other than the High 

Court and Court of Sessions. While the power of the High 

Court and Court of Sessions to grant bail is conferred by section 

439 Cr.P.C. which, unlike section 437 Cr.P.C., is unfettered by 

any conditions or limitations under section 437 Cr.P.C., 

however, bail cannot be granted "if there appear to be 

reasonable grounds for believing that an accused is guilty of an 

offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life". 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
31 133 


(v) 

Referring to the observations of the Supreme Court in Martin 

Burn Ltd. vs. R.N. Bangerjee , the State has argued that a 

15 

prima facie case does not mean a case proved to the hilt but a 

case which can be said to be established if the evidence which 

is led in support of the same were believed; and that while 

determining whether a prima facie case has been made-out the 

relevant consideration is whether on the evidence led it was 

possible to arrive at the conclusion in question and not whether 

that was the only conclusion which could be arrived at on that 

evidence. 

(vi) 
It is also pointed-out that in State of Gujarat vs. Gadhvi 

Rambhai Nathabhai and Ors , while construing section 20(8) 

16 

TADA, which provision imposed a far more onerous 

responsibility than the one under section 43D(5) UAPA, the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the power to grant bail cannot 

be exercised in a manner virtually amounting to an order of 

acquittal, giving benefit of doubt to the accused after weighing 

the evidence collected during investigation. 

(vii) The learned ASG has read the verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court in Watali (supra) to submit that the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court has said that at the stage of granting or denying bail under 

UAPA, an elaborate examination or dissection of the evidence 

is not required and the court is merely expected to record a 

finding on the basis of broad probabilities regarding the 

AIR 1958 SC 79. 

15 

(1994) 5 SC 111. 

16 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
32 133 


involvement of the accused in the commission of the stated 

offence or otherwise. It is pointed-out that relying on Watali 

(supra), this court in Ghulam Mohd. Bhat vs. National 

Investigating Agency , has said that the determination to be 

17 

made by this court at the stage of dealing with a bail application 

is within a very narrow compass and what the court is required 

to examine is the issue whether there are reasonable grounds for 

believing that the accusations made against the appellant are 

"prima facie true", which means the test to justify rejection of 

bail is whether on the evidence available it is possible to arrive 

at the conclusion that the case against the appellant is prima 

facie true. 

(viii) The State says therefore, that the case against the appellant is 

one of conspiracy to commit a crime, which is itself punishable 

as a substantive offence and every individual offence 

committed pursuant to conspiracy is a separate and distinct 

offence; and though all conspirators may not be liable for an 

individual offence, they are all guilty of the offence of 

conspiracy. It is further argued that it not necessary to prove 

that the parties actually came together and expressly agreed to 

have a common design; nor that they knew all details of the 

conspiracy, as long as the conspirators took several steps all 

towards the realisation of the object of conspiracy through a 

continued period of time, which it is urged, the record clearly 

shows in the instant case. 

(2019) SCC OnLine Del 9431. 

17 

CRL.A. 39/2021

33 133 


(ix) 

It is submitted that a perusal of the record will show that the 

appellant and the other conspirators, by their acts, pursued the 

same object, often by the same means, one performing one part 

of the act and the other performing the other part, so as to 

complete it with a view to attainment of the same object. 

(x) 
The State says that even if the objective of the conspiracy did 

not originate with the appellant or he joined after it was formed, 

he would even then be as guilty; and whatever may have been 

said or done by any of the conspirators in pursuance of the 

common design would be considered to be an act of the 

appellant. 

(xi) 
The State in fact submits that despite the unreliability of 

hearsay evidence, it is admissible in conspiracy prosecutions 

and that the rule of admissibility of evidence is relaxed in cases 

of conspiracy, since the principle of agency is attracted. 

(xii) Most importantly, it is the case of the prosecution, that the 

conspiratorial design contemplated something much more dire 

and malevolent, with repercussions on public tranquility that 

are far more serious than ordinary forms of political protest. It 

is further alleged that the chakkajam which was planned was 

with a "difference" and the intention was "to stop milk and 

water" and was to be done not only in Delhi but in "every place 

where it was possible for Muslims" to organise it. It was 

intended to "cause riots and fear". To support this submission 

the State draws attention to the portion of the subject charge-

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
34 133 


sheet extracted as Screenshot 1 and 2 in Annexure -B attached 

to this judgment. 

(xiii) As evidence of the "general agreement between the 

conspirators with regard to the common purpose", the State 

draws attention of this court to a portion of the purported 

statement dated 19.06.2020 of one of protected witnesses 

named Hector. To support this submission the State draws 

attention to the portion of the subject charge-sheet extracted as 

Screenshot 3 in Annexure -B. 

(xiv) The State alleges thereby that "a radical approach animated by 

extremist intent giving a different orientation to words of 

ordinary connotation like chakkajam is self-evident". To support 

this, the State has relied upon page No. 2052 of the subject 

charge-sheet as well as the statement of a protected witness 

named Bond, which portions are extracted as Screenshot 4 and 

5 in Annexure -B. 

(xv) The CAA only provided an excuse for the agitation, the real 

motivation of which was to denounce the existing system and 

create extreme disenchantment with it. Reliance has been 

placed by the State on the portion at page 2048 of the charge-

sheet, which has been extracted as Screenshot 6 in Annexure -

B. 

(xvi) It is argued that the subject charge-sheet further shows that the 

actions of the conspirators was premeditated, which is apparent 

from the meetings of 16.12.2019 and 17.12.2019, which 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
35 133 


followed the protest at the Parliament and at Jamia University 

on 13.12.2019 and 15.12.2019 respectively; and the two events 

having failed to yield desired results, the conspirators realised 

that stray or isolated events would not serve in achieving the 

objective of widespread turmoil, for which reason at the 

meetings of 16.12.2019 and 17.12.2019, in which the appellant 

had also participated, it was decided to hold protests in "an 

organised and planned way" and for this purpose the JCC was 

constituted; which, it is alleged, used religious identity as the 

tool to achieve its objectives. To support this submission, 

attention of the court is invited to pages 2045, 2057-59, 

2067-68 and 2070 of the subject charge-sheet, which portions 

are extracted as Screenshot 7, 8a-8c, 9a-9b and 10 in Annexure 

-B. 

(xvii) The above alleged objective of the JCC is stated to be 

corroborated by the statements recorded under section 164 

Cr.P.C. of the protected witness Bond and James. 

(xviii) The State contends that the object of JCC, with which the 

appellant is alleged to have been associated, was aligned with 

that of Muslim Students of JNU being run by one of the co-

accused/co-conspirator; and was to debunk the secular values of 

the Constitution and to aggravate differences between the 

communities so as to cause social disharmony and bring out a 

feeling of disunity. 

(xix) It is also alleged that the co-conspirators committed themselves 

to "avoiding over secularisation of movement", for which 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
36 133 


reference is made to portions of pages 2025 -26 of the subject 

charge-sheet, which are extracted as Screenshot 11 in Annexure 

-B. 

(xx) It is contended that the pamphlets were inflammatory and 

incendiary, were deliberately provocative and seditious in 

content and clearly undermined the State. In this regard the 

State refers to page 2040 of the subject charge-sheet, which is 

extracted as Screenshot 12 in Annexure -B. 

(xxi) Mr. Lekhi contends that the CAA had nothing to do with Indian 

Muslims; that there was no project to disenfranchise and 

definitely nothing to justify the allegation that Muslims will be 

put in detention camps. It is alleged that the endeavour of the 

co-conspirators was therefore only to inflame passions, whip-up 

religious frenzy and foment violence. The "burning" of Assam, 

"killing" of people and "disruption" of Delhi was intended 

towards that end. 

(xxii) It is urged that there was thus, an "emphasis upon division and 

polarisation through narrowing the areas of mutual engagement 

b y e m p h a s i s i n g e t h n o c u l t u r a l n a t i o n a l i s m o v e r 

cosmopolitanism and using the excuse of a political protest to 

give primacy to religion"; and a general disenchantment was 

sought to be created affecting the security of the State. 

Reference in this regard was made by the State to the statement 

dated 25.06.2020 of protected witness named Romeo, which is 

extracted as Screenshot 13 in Annexure -B, alleging that the 

actions therefore had the tendency of creating public disorder of

the most extreme gravity and demonstrated not just disaffection 

to the country but disloyalty to it. 

(xxiii) Though it is conceded that the appellant was excluded from the 

JCC after he was named in other FIRs, it is contended that such 

exclusion was nominal and the appellant continued to be 

associated with and participated in the objects of the conspiracy, 

which it is alleged, is apparent from his involvement in the 

meeting at Jamia University on 22.02.2020. 

(xxiv) It is argued that the "voice of sanity" (allegedly of one of the 

protected witness) was shut-out. Attention of the court was 

drawn in this regard to portions of pages 2205-06 of the subject 

charge-sheet, which portions are extracted as Screenshot 

14a-14b in Annexure -B; and it is submitted that the ill-boding 

intent of the secrecy of the real objective was apparent from the 

message of one of the co-conspirator / co-accused advising 

members from desisting sharing the real plans of conspirators in 

public. Reference in this regard was made to the portion of the 

subject charge-sheet extracted as Screenshot 15 in Annexure -

B. 

(xxv) It is alleged that in pursuance of the object, the "continued 

steps" towards the "shared intent" is apparent from page 2210 

of the subject charge-sheet, which portion is extracted as 

Screenshot 16 in Annexure -B. 

(xxvi) The State further argues that the appellant was part of the JCC 

meeting which was held on 22.02.2020 which further shows 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
38 133 


that his so-called exclusion on 24.01.2020 was "mere trickery 

to disguise his continued involvement and participation in the 

conspiracy"; and that he "remained party" to the plan to affect 

public tranquility by "engineering riots". To support this 

allegation, the State relies upon the statement of protected 

witnesses Bond and James which have been extracted as 

Screenshot 17 and 18 in Annexure -B. 

(xxvii) It is urged that the fact that the protest planned was "not a 

typical protest" normal in the political culture or democracy but 

one far more evil and injurious geared towards extremely grave 

consequences. To bolster this contention, the State relies upon 

alleged statements of protected witness Victor (page 1527-1531 

of the subject charge-sheet), Silver (page 1542-1545), Ct. Sunil 

(page 1662-1667), Ct. (GD) Mukesh (page 1681-1682), HC 

(GD) G. Nallaperumal (page 1682-1684 ) and Ct. (GD) Srinivas 

Rao (page 1684-1685), SI. Bheesham Rana (page 1801-1802) 

and Harender at (page 1802-1803), which are extracted as 

Screenshot 19a-19e, 20a-20c, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 in 

Annexure -B. 

(xxviii)It is alleged that the breach of public order was neither small 

nor insignificant but was grave and serious affecting public 

tranquility, impacting unity and integrity and creating terror; 

and that not merely law and order was affected but the even 

"tempo of the life of the community was also disturbed". 

(xxix) The State contends that the subject charge-sheet shows that 

there were 53 deaths including those of public functionaries, 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
39 133 


over seven hundred people were injured, deployment of an 

additional police force of 7800 was needed over and above the 

2200 policemen already deployed; that "protests were 

coordinated across Delhi and covered diverse areas like Jamia, 

Seelampur, Khajuri, Hauzrani, Khureji and Jafrabad", with 

there being plans to extend this protest across other cities of the 

country; and that there was extensive and widespread 

destruction of property involving settlement of claims of 

approximately Rs. 22 crores. As many as 16,381 PCR calls 

were received between 22.02.2020 and 26.02.2020; and 

cartridges, knives and swords, broken glass bottle (used for 

petrol bombs) and even scissors were weaponised and loose 

stones were liberally used. 

(xxx) It is argued that the activity in its essential quality may not be 

different from another act but in its potentiality and in its effect 

upon public tranquility there can be a vast difference. Reliance 

in this behalf is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court in Arun Ghosh vs. State of West Bengal , : 

18 

"3. … Take for instance, a man stabs another. People 
may be shocked and even disturbed, but the life of the 
community keeps moving at an even tempo, however 
much one may dislike the act. Take another case of a 
town where there is communal tension. A man stabs a 
member of the other community. This is an act of a 
very different sort. Its implications are deeper and it 
affects the even tempo of life and public order is 

(1970) 1 SCC 98. 

18 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
40 133 


jeopardized because the repercussions of the act 
embrace large sections of the community and incite 
them to make further breaches of the law and order 
and to subvert the public order. An act by itself is not 
determinant of its own gravity. In its quality it may not 
differ from another but in its potentiality it may be very 
different. …" 

(xxxi) It is further argued that the same principle was reiterated by the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Giridhari Parmanand Vadhava vs. 

State of Maharashtra , in the context of what constitutes a 

19 

terrorist act, where the Hon'ble Supreme Court holds that it is 

the impact of the crime and its fallout on the society and 

potentiality of such crime in producing fear in the minds of the 

people or a section of the people which makes a crime, a 

terrorist activity under section 3(1) of TADA. 

(xxxii) Much emphasis was laid by the learned ASG on the word 

'likely' being part of section 15, to urge that even presuming 

that 'intention' is not held to be disclosed on the appellant's 

part, the 'likelihood' of what section 15 contemplates will 

attract the provision. It is argued that the word 'likely' means 

"of such nature or so circumstantial as to make probable". 

(xxxiii)The State accordingly alleges that the actions of the co-

conspirators, including the appellant were (i) premeditated (ii) 

directed at a wider audience (iii) involved attacks on symbolic 

targets including civilians (iv) entailed acts of violence seen by 

the society as "extra normal" intended to provoke an 

(1996) 11 SCC 179. 

19 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
41 133 


overreaction serving as a catalyst for more general conflict and 

publicised as a political cause inducing both fear and a sense of 

insecurity, by reason of which the characteristics of 'terrorism' 

as set-out by Paul Wilikson and cited in People's Union For 

Civil Liberties and Anr. vs. Union of India , ('PUCL', for 

20 

short) and Mohd. Iqbal M. Shaikh and Ors. vs. State of 

Maharashtra are duly satisfied. The State argues that under 

21 

the UAPA, it is not just the intent to threaten the unity and 

integrity but the likelihood to threaten the unity and integrity, 

not just the intent to strike terror but the likelihood to strike 

terror, not just the use of firearms but the use of any means of 

whatsoever nature, the means not just causing but likely to 

cause not just death but injuries to any person or persons or loss 

or damage or destruction of property, constitutes terrorist act 

within the meaning of section 15 of UAPA. 

(xxxiv)It is urged that moreover, under section 18 of UAPA, not merely 

conspiracy to commit a terrorist act but an attempt to commit or 

advocating the commission or advising it or inciting or 

directing or knowingly facilitating commission of a terrorist act 

is also punishable. In fact, even acts preparatory to commission 

of terrorist acts are punishable under section 18 of UAPA. 

(xxxv) It is submitted that the objection of the appellant that a case is 

not made-out under UAPA is based on assessing the degree of 

sufficiency and credibility of evidence not the absence of its 

(2004) 9 SCC 580. 

20 

(1998) 4 SCC 494. 

21 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
42 133 


existence but the extent of its applicability; but that such 

objection of the appellant is outside the scope of section 43D(5) 

of the UAPA. 

(xxxvi)Distinguishing the present case from that in K.A. Najeeb 

(supra), the State argues that the reason for grant of bail in that 

case was "long period of incarceration and unlikelihood of the 

trial being completed anytime in the near future"; and that in 

K.A. Najeeb (supra), the High Court had relied upon a judgment 

of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shaheen Welfare Association 

vs. Union of India and Ors , wherein it was held that "no one 

22 

can justify gross delay in disposal of cases when undertrial 

perforce remains in jail giving rise to possible situations that 

may justify invocation of Article 21"; and that the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court did not interfere with the order passed by the 

High Court because of "there being no likelihood of trial being 

completed within the reasonable time and the period of 

incarceration already undergone has exceeded a substantial part 

of the prescribed sentence". It is pointed-out that in State of 

Maharashtra vs. Abdul Hamid Haji Mohammed , 

23 

notwithstanding section 19 of TADA providing for an appeal to 

the Supreme Court from an order passed by the Designated 

Court, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had yet held that in extreme 

cases where accusations are ex facie not constituting an offence, 

power under Article 226 of the Constitution can be invoked but 

(1996) 2 SC 616. 

22 

(1994) 2 SCC 664. 

23 

CRL.A. 39/2021

43 133 


that in the present case the appellant has not chosen to invoke 

Article 226 of the Constitution. 

Analysis of section 15 UAPA 

28. Before applying the additional conditions engrafted in section 43D(5) 

UAPA, it would be advisable to first analyse if the allegations against 

the appellant contained in the subject charge-sheet even prima facie 

disclose the commission of an offence under sections 15 and 18 of the 

UAPA. Although section 15 of the UAPA defines 'terrorist act' and 

section 18 provides for 'punishment for conspiracy for committing a 

terrorist act, including an attempt to commit or advocating, abetting, 

advising or inciting the commission of a terrorist act, as also of any act 

preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act', the word 'terrorism' or 

'terror' has nowhere been defined in the UAPA. For completeness it 

may be noticed that section 2(1)(k) of the UAPA says that the phrase 

'terrorist act' shall have the meaning as assigned to it in section 15 and 

that the expressions 'terrorism' and 'terrorist' shall be construed 

accordingly. 

29. What however, is 'terrorism' or 'terror', from which the meaning of 

'terrorist act' and other related words may be derived? 

30. The concept and construction of terrorism has been dealt-with by the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court in relation to earlier legislations inter alia in 

the decisions discussed below. 

31. In Hitendra Vishnu Thakur & Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. , 

24 

defining terrorism, the Hon'ble Supreme Court says : 

(1994) 4 SCC 602. 

24 

CRL.A. 39/2021

"7. 'Terrorism' is one of the manifestations of increased 
lawlessness and cult of violence. Violence and crime constitute a 
threat to an established order and are a revolt against a civilised 
society. 'Terrorism' has not been defined under TADA nor is it 
possible to give a precise definition of 'terrorism' or lay down what 
constitutes 'terrorism'. It may be possible to describe it as use of 
violence when its most important result is not merely the physical 
and mental damage of the victim but the prolonged psychological 
effect it produces or has the potential of producing on the society 
as a whole. There may be death, injury, or destruction of property 
or even deprivation of individual liberty in the process but the 
extent and reach of the intended terrorist activity travels beyond 
the effect of an ordinary crime capable of being punished under 
the ordinary penal law of the land and its main objective is to 
overawe the Government or disturb harmony of the society or 
"terrorise" people and the society and not only those directly 
assaulted, with a view to disturb even tempo, peace and tranquillity 
of the society and create a sense of fear and insecurity. A 'terrorist' 
activity does not merely arise by causing disturbance of law and 
order or of public order. The fall out of the intended activity must 
be such that it travels beyond the capacity of the ordinary law 
enforcement agencies to tackle it under the ordinary penal law. 
Experience has shown us that 'terrorism' is generally an attempt to 
acquire or maintain power or control by intimidation and causing 
fear and helplessness in the minds of the people at large or any 
section thereof and is a totally abnormal phenomenon. What 
distinguishes 'terrorism' from other forms of violence, therefore, 
appears to be the deliberate and systematic use of coercive 
intimidation. More often than not, a hardened criminal today takes 
advantage of the situation and by wearing the cloak of 'terrorism', 
aims to achieve for himself acceptability and respectability in the 
society because unfortunately in the States affected by militancy, a 
'terrorist' is projected as a hero by his group and often even by the 
misguided youth. It is therefore, essential to treat such a criminal 
and deal with him differently than an ordinary criminal capable of 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
45 133 


being tried by the ordinary courts under the penal law of the land. 
Even though the crime committed by a 'terrorist' and an ordinary 
criminal would be overlapping to an extent but then it is not the 
intention of the Legislature that every criminal should be tried 
under TADA, where the fall out of his activity does not extend 
beyond the normal frontiers of the ordinary criminal activity. 
Every 'terrorist' may be a criminal but every criminal cannot be 
given the label of a 'terrorist' only to set in motion the more 
stringent provisions of TADA. The criminal activity in order to 
invoke TADA must be committed with the requisite intention as 
contemplated by Section 3(1) of the Act by use of such weapons as 
have been enumerated in Section 3(1) and which cause or are likely 
to result in the offences as mentioned in the said section." 

(emphasis supplied) 

32. TADA deals with activity "which cannot be classified as a mere law 

and order problem or disturbance of public order or even disturbance of 

the even tempo of the life of the community of any specified locality, 

but is of the nature which cannot be tackled as an ordinary criminal 

activity under the ordinary penal law by the normal law enforcement 

agencies because the intended extent and reach of the criminal activity 

of the 'terrorist' is such which travels beyond the gravity of the mere 

disturbance of public order even of a 'virulent nature' and may at times 

transcend the frontiers of the locality...", as explained by the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court in Kartar Singh (supra) : 

"68. The terrorism, the Act (TADA) contemplates, cannot be 
classified as mere disturbance of 'public order' disturbing the 
"even tempo of the life of community of any specified locality" -
in the words of Hidayatullah, C.J. in Arun Ghosh v. State of W.B. 
[(1970) 1 SCC 98] but it is much more, rather a grave emergent 
situation created either by external forces particularly at the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
46 133 


frontiers of this country or by anti-nationals throwing a challenge 
to the very existence and sovereignty of the country in its 
democratic polity." 

(emphasis supplied) 

33. Since the theme of section 15 is evidently the intent or likelihood of an 

act threatening (i) the security of the State, described variously in the 

section as unity, integrity, security, economic security, sovereignty and 

(ii) of striking terror, it is necessary to understand the concept and 

distinction between "law and order", "public order" and "security of 

the State", as eloquently explained by Hidayatullah, J. (as the learned 

Chief Justice then was) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ram 

Manohar Lohia (Dr) vs. State of Bihar : 

25 

"55. It will thus appear that just as "public order" in the rulings of 
this Court (earlier cited) was said to comprehend disorders of less 
gravity than those affecting "security of State", "law and order" 
also comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting 
"public order". One has to imagine three concentric circles. Law 
and order represents the largest circle within which is the next 
circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents 
security of State. It is then easy to see that an act may affect law 
and order but not public order just as an act may affect public 
order but not security of the State.… 

34. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kartar Singh (supra) observed: 

"67. In order to ascertain the pith and substance of the impugned 
enactments, the preamble, Statement of Objects and Reasons, the 
legal significance and the intendment of the provisions of these 
Acts, their scope and the nexus with the object that these Acts seek 
to subserve must be objectively examined in the background of the 

AIR 1966 SC 740. 

25

totality of the series of events -due to the unleashing of terrorism, 
waves after waves, leading to the series of bomb blasts causing 
extensive damage to the properties, killing of hundreds of people, 
the blood-curdling incidents during which the blood of the sons of 
the soil had been spilled over the soil of their motherland itself, the 
ruthless massacre of the defenceless and innocent people especially 
of poor as if they were all 'marked for death' or for 'human 
sacrifice' and the sudden outbreak of violence, mass killing of army 
personnel, jawans of Border Security Force, government officials, 
politicians, statesmen, heads of religious sects by using bombs and 
sophisticated lethal weapons thereby injecting a sense of insecurity 
in the minds of the people, with the intention of destabilizing the 
sovereignty or overthrowing the Government as established by law. 
The way in which the alleged violent crimes is shown to have been 
perpetrated, the manner in which they have been cruelly executed, 
the vulnerable territorial frontiers which form part of the scene of 
unprecedented and unprovoked occurrences, lead to an 
inescapable illation and conclusion that the activities of the 
terrorists and disruptionists pose a serious challenge to the very 
existence of sovereignty as well as to the security of India 
notwithstanding the fact whether such threats or challenges come by 
way of external aggression or internal disturbance. 

* * * * * 

"113. Though normally the plain ordinary grammatical meaning of 
an enactment affords the best guide and the object of interpreting a 
statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature enacting it, 
other methods of extracting the meaning can be resorted to if the 
language is contradictory, ambiguous or leads really to absurd 
results so as to keep at the real sense and meaning. See (1) 
Salmond : Jurisprudence, 11th Edn. p. 152, (2) South Asia 
Industries (P) Ltd. v. S. Sarup Singh [AIR 1966 SC 346, 348] (AIR 
at p. 348), and (3) G. Narayanaswami v. G. Panneerselvam [(1972) 
3 SCC 717] (SCC at p. 720)."

35. Illustrating what terrorist acts might be, in PUCL (supra), the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court says : 

"6. In all acts of terrorism, it is mainly the psychological element 
that distinguishes it from other political offences, which are 
invariably accompanied with violence and disorder. Fear is 
induced not merely by making civilians the direct targets of violence 
but also by exposing them to a sense of insecurity. It is in this 
context that this Court held in Mohd. Iqbal M. Shaikh v. State of 
Maharashtra [(1998) 4 SCC 494] that: (SCC p. 504, para 7) 

"[I]t is not possible to give a precise definition of 
terrorism or to lay down what constitutes terrorism. But 
… it may be possible to describe it as use of violence 
when its most important result is not merely the 
physical and mental damage of the victim but the 
prolonged psychological effect it produces or has the 
potential of producing on the society as a whole. … if 
the object of the activity is to disturb harmony of the 
society or to terrorize people and the society with a view 
to disturb the even tempo, tranquillity of the society, and 
a sense of fear and insecurity is created in the minds of a 
section of the society at large, then it will, undoubtedly, 
be held to be a terrorist act." 

* * * * * 

"8. All these terrorist strikes have certain common features. They 
could be very broadly grouped into three: 

1. Attack on the institution of democracy, which is the 
very basis of our country (by attacking Parliament, 
Legislative Assembly etc.). And the attack on economic 
system by targeting economic nerve centres. 

2. Attack on symbols of national pride and on security/ 
strategic installations (e.g. Red Fort, military 
installations and camps, radio stations etc.). 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
49 133 


3. Attack on civilians to generate terror and fear 
psychosis among the general populace. The attack at 
worshipping places to injure sentiments and to whip 
communal passions. These are designed to position the 
people against the Government by creating a feeling of 
insecurity. 

"9. Terrorist acts are meant to destabilise the nation by 
challenging its sovereignty and integrity, to raze the constitutional 
principles that we hold dear, to create a psyche of fear and 
anarchism among common people, to tear apart the secular fabric, 
to overthrow democratically elected government, to promote 
prejudice and bigotry, to demoralise the security forces, to thwart 
the economic progress and development and so on. This cannot be 
equated with a usual law and order problem within a State. On the 
other hand, it is inter-State, international or cross-border in 
character. Fight against the overt and covert acts of terrorism is 
not a regular criminal justice endeavour. Rather, it is defence of 
our nation and its citizens. It is a challenge to the whole nation 
and invisible force of Indianness that binds this great nation 
together. Therefore, terrorism is a new challenge for law 
enforcement. By indulging in terrorist activities organised groups or 
individuals, trained, inspired and supported by fundamentalists and 
anti-Indian elements are trying to destabilise the country. This new 
breed of menace was hitherto unheard of. Terrorism is definitely a 
criminal act, but it is much more than mere criminality. Today the 
Government is charged with the duty of protecting the unity, 
integrity, secularism and sovereignty of India from terrorists, both 
from outside and within the borders. To face terrorism we need new 
approaches, techniques, weapons, expertise and of course new laws. 
In the abovesaid circumstances Parliament felt that a new anti-
terrorism law is necessary for a better future. This parliamentary 
resolve is epitomised in POTA."

36. More recently in Yakub Abdul Razak Memon vs State of Maharashtra 

through CBI, Bombay , the Hon'ble Supreme Court held: 

26 

"809. The term "terrorism" is a concept that is commonly and 
widely used in everyday parlance and is derived from the Latin word 
"terror" which means the state of intense fear and submission to it. 
There is no particular form of terror, hence, anything intended to 
create terror in the minds of general public in order to endanger the 
lives of the members and damage to public property may be termed 
as a terrorist act and a manifestation of terrorism. Black's Law 
Dictionary defines terrorism as: 

"Terrorism.-The use or threat of violence to intimidate 
or cause panic, esp. as a means of affecting political 
conduct." (8th Edn., p. 1512.) 

"810. Terrorism is a global phenomenon in today's world and India 
is one of the worst victims of terrorist acts. Terrorism has a long 
history of being used to achieve political, religious and ideological 
objectives. Acts of terrorism can range from threats to actual 
assassinations, kidnappings, airline hijackings, bomb scares, car 
bombs, building explosions, mailing of dangerous materials, 
computer based attacks and the use of chemical, biological, and 
nuclear weapons-weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

"816. The United Nations Security Council in its 2004 Resolution 
[Ed. : UN Doc. S/RES/1566 (2004); Resolution 1566 (2004) 
adopted by the Security Council on 8-10-2004.] denounced 
"terrorist acts" as follows" 

"criminal acts, including against civilians, committed 
with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, 
or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a 
state of terror in the general public or in a group of

persons or particular persons, intimidate a population 
or compel a Government or an international 
organisation to do or abstain from doing any act, 
which constitute offences within the scope of and as 
defined in the international conventions and protocols 
relating to terrorism, are under no circumstances 
justifiable by considerations or a political, 
philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or 
other similar nature,..."

37. In Zameer Ahmed Latifur Rehman Sheikh vs. State of Maharashtra 

& Ors , dealing with the constitutionality of MCOCA and opining on 

27 

the distinction between 'public order' and 'security of the State', the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court says : 

"31. It has been time and again held by this Court that the 
expression "public order" is of a wide connotation. In Romesh 
Thappar v. State of Madras [AIR 1950 SC 124] it has been held by 
this Court that "public order" signifies a state of tranquillity which 
prevails among the members of a political society as a result of 
internal regulations enforced by the Government which they have 
established. This Court, in para 10, at AIR p. 128, quoted a passage 
from Stephen's Criminal Law of England, wherein he observed as 
follows: 

"Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, 
levying of war, are offences which run into each other 
and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly 
defined boundaries. All of them have in common one 
feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a 
civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned 

(2010) 5 SCC 246. 

27 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
52 133 


disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show 
and threat of it." 

This Court further observed that though all these offences 
involve disturbances of public tranquillity and are in theory 
offences against public order, the difference between them is 
only one of degree. The Constitution thus requires a line, 
perhaps only a rough line, to be drawn between the fields of 
public order or tranquillity and those serious and aggravated 
forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger 
the security of the State. 

"32. In Supdt., Central Prison v. Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia [AIR 
1960 SC 633] this Court had held that "public order" is 
synonymous with public safety and tranquillity, and it is the 
absence of any disorder involving a breach of local significance in 
contradistinction to national upheavals, such as revolution, civil 
strife, war, affecting the security of the State. 

"33. Subsequently, in Ram Manohar Lohia (Dr.) v. State of Bihar 
[AIR 1966 SC 740], Hidayatullah, J., held that any contravention of 
law always affected order, but before it could be said to affect 
public order, it must affect the community at large. He was of the 
opinion that offences against "law and order", "public order", and 
"security of State" are demarcated on the basis of their gravity. The 
said observation is as follows: (AIR pp. 758-59, para 52) 

"52. It will thus appear that just as 'public order' in the 
rulings of this Court (earlier cited) was said to 
comprehend disorders of less gravity than those 
affecting 'security of State', 'law and order' also 
comprehends disorders of less gravity than those 
affecting 'public order'. One has to imagine three 
concentric circles. Law and order represents the largest 
circle within which is the next circle representing public 
order and the smallest circle represents security of State. 
It is then easy to see that an act may affect law and

order but not public order just as an act may affect 
public order but not security of the State." 

"34. The Constitution Bench of this Court in Madhu Limaye v. Sub-
Divisional Magistrate, Monghyr [(1970) 3 SCC 746] while 
adopting and explaining the scope of the test laid down in Ram 
Manohar Lohia (Dr.) v. State of Bihar [AIR 1966 SC 740] stated 
that the State is at the centre of the society. Disturbances in the 
normal functioning of the society fall into a broad spectrum, from 
mere disturbance of the serenity of life to jeopardy of the State. The 
acts become more and more grave as we journey from the periphery 
of the largest circle towards the centre. In this journey we travel first 
through public tranquillity, then through public order and lastly to 
the security of the State. This Court further held that in the judgment 
of this Court, the expression "in the interest of public order" as 
mentioned in the Constitution of India encompasses not only those 
acts which disturb the security of the State or acts within ordre 
publique as described but also certain acts which disturb public 
tranquillity or are breaches of the peace. It is not necessary to give 
the expression a narrow meaning because, as has been observed, the 
expression "in the interest of public order" is very wide." 

(emphasis supplied) 

38. In the same judgment observing that a court must always presume that 

a statute was within the legislative competence of the legislature that 

drafted it, the Hon'ble Supreme Court further says: 

"39. It is also a cardinal rule of interpretation that there shall 
always be a presumption of constitutionality in favour of a statute 
and while construing such statute every legally permissible effort 
should be made to keep the statute within the competence of the 
State Legislature. (Reference may be made to Charanjit Lal 
Chowdhury v. Union of India [AIR 1951 SC 41], T.M.A. Pai 
Foundation v. State of Karnataka [(2002) 8 SCC 481] and 
Karnataka Bank Ltd. v. State of A.P. [(2008) 2 SCC 254] )"

39. In the same judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court has also explained 

the intention of Legislature in enacting UAPA and has said that UAPA 

falls under Entry 1 of List-I of the Seventh Schedule of the 

Constitution: 

"64. Prior to the 2004 Amendment, UAPA did not contain the 
provisions to deal with terrorism and terrorist activities. By the 2004 
Amendment, new provisions were inserted in UAPA to deal with 
terrorism and terrorist activities. The Preamble of UAPA was also 
amended to state that the said Act is enacted to provide for the more 
effective prevention of certain unlawful activities of individuals and 
associations, and dealing with terrorist activities and for matters 
connected therewith. 

"65. In the 2008 Amendment, the Preamble has again been amended 
and the amended Preamble now also contains a reference to the 
Resolution adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations on 
28-9-2001 and also makes reference to the other resolutions passed 
by the Security Council requiring the States (nations which are 
members of the United Nations) to take action against certain 
terrorist and terrorist organisations. It also makes reference to the 
order issued by the Central Government in exercise of power under 
Section 2 of the United Nations (Security Council) Act, 1947 which 
is known as the Prevention and Suppression of Terrorism 
(Implementation of Security Council Resolutions) Order, 2007. 

* * * * * 

"72. The precise reason why we have extracted the list of terrorist 
organisations under UAPA hereinbefore is to bring to the fore the 
contrast between the two legislations which are in question before 
us. The exhaustive list of terrorist organisations in the First 
Schedule to UAPA has been included in order to show the type and 
nature of the organisations contemplated under that Act. A careful 
look of the same would indicate that all the organisations 
mentioned therein have as their aims and objects undermining 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
55 133 


and prejudicially affecting the integrity and sovereignty of India, 
which certainly stand on a different footing when compared to the 
activities carried out by the forces like the appellant. 

* * * * * * 

"75. A perusal of the Preamble, the Statement of Objects and 
Reasons and the interpretation clauses of MCOCA and UAPA would 
show that both the Acts operate in different fields and the ambit 
and scope of each is distinct from the other. So far as MCOCA is 
concerned, it principally deals with prevention and control of 
criminal activity by organised crime syndicate or gang within India 
and its purpose is to curb a wide range of criminal activities 
indulged in by organised syndicate or gang. The aim of UAPA, on 
the other hand, is to deal with terrorist and certain unlawful 
activities, which are committed with the intent to threaten the 
unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or with the intent 
to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India 
or in any foreign country or relate to cessation or secession of the 
territory of India. 

* * * * * 

"77. The offence of terrorist act under Section 15 and the offence of 
unlawful activity under Section 2(1)(o) of UAPA have some elements 
in commonality. The essential element in both is the challenge or 
threat or likely threat to the sovereignty, security, integrity and 
unity of India. While Section 15 requires some physical act like use 
of bombs and other weapons, etc., Section 2(1)(o) takes in its 
compass even written or spoken words or any other visible 
representation intended or which supports a challenge to the unity, 
sovereignty, integrity and security of India. The said offences are 
related to the defence of India and are covered by Entry 1 of the 
Union List. 

"78. Moreover, the meaning of the term "unlawful activity" in 
MCOCA is altogether different from the meaning of the term 
"unlawful activity" in UAPA. It is also pertinent to note that MCOCA 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
56 133 


does not deal with the terrorist organisations which indulge in 
terrorist activities and similarly, UAPA does not deal with organised 
gangs or crime syndicate of the kind specifically targeted by 
MCOCA. Thus, the offence of organised crime under MCOCA and the 
offence of terrorist act under UAPA operate in different fields and 
are of different kinds and their essential contents and ingredients are 
altogether different." 

(emphasis supplied) 

40. Another sacrosanct principle of interpretation of penal provisions is 

that they must be construed strictly and narrowly, to ensure that a 

person who was not within the legislative intendment does not get 

roped into a penal provision. Also, the more stringent a penal provision, 

the more strictly it must be construed. A brief reference to the decisions 

of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this behalf may be made here. 

41. In A.K. Roy vs. Union of India and Ors. , dealing with the validity of 

28 

certain provisions of the National Security Ordinance/Act, which were 

challenged as unconstitutional on the ground of vagueness, and which 

ordinance provided for preventive detention, the majority of a 5-Judge 

Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court partly accepted the challenge, 

holding that what constitutes 'essential services and supplies' should 

have been specified and published in advance by a law, order or 

notification, and says: 

"62. The requirement that crimes must be defined with appropriate 
definiteness is regarded as a fundamental concept in criminal law 
and must now be regarded as a pervading theme of our 
Constitution since the decision in Maneka Gandhi [AIR 1978 SC 
597]. The underlying principle is that every person is entitled to be 

(1982) 1 SCC 271. 

28 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
57 133 


informed as to what the State commands or forbids and that the 
life and liberty of a person cannot be put in peril on an ambiguity. 
However, even in the domain of criminal law, the processes of which 
can result in the taking away of life itself, no more than a reasonable 
degree of certainty has to be accepted as a fact. Neither the criminal 
law nor the Constitution requires the application of impossible 
standards and therefore, what is expected is that the language of 
the law must contain an adequate warning of the conduct which 
may fall within the proscribed area, when measured by common 
understanding. In criminal law, the legislature frequently uses 
vague expressions like 'bring into hatred or contempt', or 
'maintenance of harmony between different religious groups', or 
'likely to cause disharmony or … hatred or ill will', or 'annoyance 
to the public' [see Sections 124-A, 153-A(1)(b), 153-B(1)(c), and 
268 of the Penal Code]. These expressions, though they are 
difficult to define, do not elude a just application to practical 
situations. The use of language carries with it the inconvenience 
of the imperfections of language. 

"63. We see that the concepts aforesaid, namely, 'defence of 
India', 'security of India', 'security of the State' and 'relations of 
India with foreign powers', which are mentioned in Section 3 of 
the Act, are not of any great certainty or definiteness. But in the 
very nature of things they are difficult to define. We cannot 
therefore strike down these provisions of Section 3 of the Act on the 
ground of their vagueness and uncertainty. We must, however, utter 
a word of caution that since the concepts are not defined, 
undoubtedly because they are not capable of a precise definition, 
courts must strive to give to those concepts a narrower 
construction than what the literal words suggest. While construing 
laws of preventive detention like the National Security Act, care 
must be taken to restrict their application to as few situations as 
possible. Indeed, that can well be the unstated premise for 
upholding the constitutionality of clauses like those in Section 3, 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
58 133 


which are fraught with grave consequences to personal liberty, if 
construed liberally. 

"64. What we have said above in regard to the expressions 
'defence of India', 'security of India', 'security of the State' and 
'relations of India with foreign powers' cannot apply to the 
expression "acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance 
of supplies and services essential to the community" which occurs 
in Section 3(2) of the Act. Which supplies and services are 
essential to the community can easily be defined by the legislature 
and indeed, legislations which regulate the prices and possession of 
essential commodities either enumerate those commodities or confer 
upon the appropriate Government the power to do so. In the 
absence of a definition of 'supplies and services essential to the 
community', the detaining authority will be free to extend the 
application of this clause of sub-section (2) to any commodities or 
services the maintenance of supply of which, according to him, is 
essential to the community. 

"65. But that is not all. The Explanation to sub-section (2) gives to 
the particular phrase in that sub-section a meaning which is not 
only uncertain but which, at any given point of time, will be difficult 
to ascertain or fasten upon. … We find it quite difficult to 
understand as to which are the remaining commodities outside the 
scope of the Act of 1980, in respect of which it can be said that the 
maintenance of their supplies is essential to the community. The 
particular clause in sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the National 
Security Act is, therefore, capable of wanton abuse in that, the 
detaining authority can place under detention any person for 
possession of any commodity on the basis that the authority is of 
the opinion that the maintenance of supply of that commodity is 
essential to the community. We consider the particular clause not 
only vague and uncertain but, in the context of the Explanation, 
capable of being extended cavalierly to supplies, the maintenance of 
which is not essential to the community. To allow the personal 
liberty of the people to be taken away by the application of that 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
59 133 


clause would be a flagrant violation of the fairness and justness of 
procedure which is implicit in the provisions of Article 21. 

* * * * * 

"67. We do not, however, propose to strike down the power given to 
detain persons under Section 3(2) on the ground that they are acting 
in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and 
services essential to the community. The reason for this is that it is 
vitally necessary to ensure a steady flow of supplies and services 
which are essential to the community, and if the State has the power 
to detain persons on the grounds mentioned in Section 3(1) and the 
other grounds mentioned in Section 3(2), it must also have the 
power to pass orders of detention on this particular ground. What 
we propose to do is to hold that no person can be detained with a 
view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to 
the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the 
community unless, by a law, order or notification made or 
published fairly in advance, the supplies and services, the 
maintenance of which is regarded as essential to the community 
and in respect of which the order of detention is proposed to be 
passed, are made known appropriately, to the public."

29 

Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court cites with approval its decision in 

Niranjan Singh Karam Singh Punjabi vs Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya , 

30 

and says : 

"17. … Applying the settled rule of construction of penal statutes in

one of us (Ahmadi, J.) construing certain provisions of the TADA Act 
reiterated the principle thus: (SCC pp. 85-86, para 8) 

"The Act is a penal statute. Its provisions are drastic in 
that they provide minimum punishments and in certain 
cases enhanced punishments also; make confessional 
statements made to a police officer not below the rank of 
a Superintendent of Police admissible in evidence and 
mandates raising of a rebuttable presumption on proof 
of facts stated in clauses (a) to (d) of sub-section (1) of 
Section 21. Provision is also made in regard to the 
identification of an accused who is not traced through 
photographs. There are some of the special provisions 
introduced in the Act with a view to controlling the 
menace of terrorism. These provisions are a departure 
from the ordinary law since the said law was found to be 
inadequate and not sufficiently effective to deal with the 
special class of offenders indulging in terrorist and 
disruptive activities. There can, therefore, be no doubt 
that the legislature considered such crimes to be of an 
aggravated nature which could not be checked or 
controlled under the ordinary law and enacted deterrent 
provisions to combat the same. The legislature, 
therefore, made special provisions which can in certain 
respects be said to be harsh, created a special forum for 
the speedy disposal of such cases, provided for raising a 
presumption of guilt, placed extra restrictions in regard 
to the release of the offender on bail, and made suitable 
changes in the procedure with a view to achieving its 
objects. It is well settled that statutes which impose a 
term of imprisonment for what is a criminal offence 
under the law must be strictly construed. 

* * * 

Therefore when a law visits a person with serious penal 
consequences extra care must be taken to ensure that 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
61 133 


those whom the legislature did not intend to be covered 
by the express language of the statute are not roped in 
by stretching the law." 

With respect, we fully concur with the above perception for 
construing the provisions of the TADA Act" 

(emphasis supplied) 

43. In Ranjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma vs. State of Maharashtra and 

Anr , a 3-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court says : 

31 

"23. Interpretation clauses contained in Sections 2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) 
are interrelated. An "organised crime syndicate" refers to an 
"organised crime" which in turn refers to "continuing unlawful 
activity". As at present advised, it may not be necessary for us to 
consider as to whether the words "or other unlawful means" 
c o n t a i n e d i n S e c t i o n 2 ( e ) s h o u l d b e re a d " e j u s d e m 
generis"/"noscitur a sociis" with the words (i) violence, (ii) threat 
of violence, (iii) intimidation, or (iv) coercion. We may, however, 
notice that the word "violence" has been used only in Sections 146 
and 153-A of the Penal Code, 1860. The word "intimidation" alone 
has not been used therein but only Section 506 occurring in Chapter 
XXII thereof refers to "criminal intimidation". The word "coercion" 
finds place only in the Contract Act. If the words "unlawful means" 
are to be widely construed as including any or other unlawful 
means, having regard to the provisions contained in Sections 400, 
401 and 413 IPC relating to commission of offences of cheating or 
criminal breach of trust, the provisions of the said Act can be 
applied, which prima facie, does not appear to have been intended 
by Parliament. 

"24. The Statement of Objects and Reasons clearly states as to why 
the said Act had to be enacted. Thus, it will be safe to presume that 
the expression "any unlawful means" must refer to any such act 

(2005) 5 SCC 294. 

31 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
62 133 


which has a direct nexus with the commission of a crime which 
MCOCA seeks to prevent or control. In other words, an offence 
falling within the definition of organised crime and committed by an 
organised crime syndicate is the offence contemplated by the 
Statement of Objects and Reasons. There are offences and offences 
under the Penal Code, 1860 and other penal statutes providing for 
punishment of three years or more and in relation to such offences 
more than one charge-sheet may be filed. As we have indicated 
hereinbefore, only because a person cheats or commits a criminal 
breach of trust, more than once, the same by itself may not be 
sufficient to attract the provisions of MCOCA. Furthermore, mens 
rea is a necessary ingredient for commission of a crime under 
MCOCA. 

* * * * * 

"38. We are furthermore of the opinion that the restrictions on the 
power of the court to grant bail should not be pushed too far. If the 
court, having regard to the materials brought on record, is 
satisfied that in all probability he may not be ultimately convicted, 
an order granting bail may be passed. ...What would further be 
necessary on the part of the court is to see the culpability of the 
accused in his involvement in the commission of an organised crime 
either directly or indirectly. The court at the time of considering the 
application for grant of bail shall consider the question from the 
angle as to whether he was possessed of the requisite mens rea.…" 

(emphasis supplied) 

44. To complete the analysis as regards the presumption of constitutionality 

of a statute, a brief reference may also be made to this presumption as 

explained succinctly in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia & Ors. vs. Shri 

Justice S.R. Tendolkar & Ors , where a 5-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble 

32 

Supreme Court says: 

AIR 1958 SC 538. 

32 

CRL.A. 39/2021

63 133 


"11. …The principle enunciated above has been consistently 
adopted and applied in subsequent cases. The decisions of this 
Court further establish-

… 

(c) that it must be presumed that the legislature understands 
and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its 
laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience 
and that its discriminations are based on adequate 
grounds; 

(d) that the legislature is free to recognise degrees of harm 
and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the 
need is deemed to be the clearest; 

(e) that in order to sustain the presumption of 
constitutionality the court may take into consideration 
matters of common knowledge, matters of common report, 
the history of the times and may assume every state of facts 
which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation; 
and 

(f) that while good faith and knowledge of the existing 
conditions on the part of a legislature are to be presumed, if 
there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding 
circumstances brought to the notice of the court on which the 
classification may reasonably be regarded as based, the 
presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried to the 
extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed 
and un-known reasons for subjecting certain individuals or 
corporations to hostile or discriminating legislation. 

The above principles will have to be constantly borne in mind by the 
court when it is called upon to adjudge the constitutionality of any 
particular law attacked as discriminatory and violative of the equal 
protection of the laws."

45. Since the event that led to the registration of the subject FIR arose from 

a protest allegedly organised and arranged inter alia by the appellant, it 

would be worthwhile at this point to appreciate the constitutional 

protection offered under our jurisprudence to the 'right to protest', 

which right has been repeatedly and unequivocally been held to be part 

of the fundamental rights guaranteed under our Constitution. The right 

to protest has been discussed and expatiated in various judgements, a 

reference to some of which is made below. 

46. In Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan vs Union of India and Anr , the 

33 

Hon'ble Supreme Court says: 

"48. …Undoubtedly, holding peaceful demonstrations by the 
citizenry in order to air its grievances and to ensure that these 
grievances are heard in the relevant quarters, is its fundamental 
right. This right is specifically enshrined under Articles 19(1)(a) 
and 19(1)(b) of the Constitution of India. Article 19(1)(a) confers a 
very valuable right on the citizens, namely, right of free speech. 
Likewise, Article 19(1)(b) gives the right to assemble peacefully and 
without arms. Together, both these rights ensure that the people of 
this country have the right to assemble peacefully and protest 
against any of the actions or the decisions taken by the 
Government or other governmental authorities which are not to 
the liking. Legitimate dissent is a distinguishable feature of any 
democracy. Question is not as to whether the issue raised by the 
protestors is right or wrong or it is justified or unjustified. The 
fundamental aspect is the right which is conferred upon the 
affected people in a democracy to voice their grievances. 
Dissenters may be in minority. They have a right to express their 
views. A particular cause which, in the first instance, may appear 
to be insignificant or irrelevant may gain momentum and

33

acceptability when it is duly voiced and debated. That is the reason 
that this Court has always protected the valuable right of peaceful 
and orderly demonstrations and protests. 

"49. In Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1961 SC 
884], this Court observed: (AIR p. 891, para 31) 

"31. The right of citizens to take out processions or to 
hold public meetings flows from the right in Article 
19(1)(b) to assemble peaceably and without arms and 
the right to move anywhere in the territory of India." 

"50. In Kameshwar Prasad v. State of Bihar [AIR 1962 SC 1166] 
the Court was mainly dealing with the question whether the right to 
make a demonstration is protected under Articles 19(1)(a) and (b) 
and whether a government servant is entitled to this right. This 
Court held: (AIR p. 1171, para 13) 

"13. … A demonstration might take the form of an 
assembly and even then the intention is to convey to 
the person or authority to whom the communication is 
intended the feelings of the group which assembles. It 
necessarily follows that there are forms of 
demonstration which would fall within the freedoms 
guaranteed by Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b). It is 
needless to add that from the very nature of things a 
demonstration may take various forms; it may be noisy 
and disorderly, for instance stone-throwing by a crowd 
may be cited as an example of a violent and disorderly 
demonstration and this would not obviously be within 
Article 19(1)(a) or (b). It can equally be peaceful and 
orderly such as happens when the members of the group 
merely wear some badge drawing attention to their 
grievances." 

"51. The Supreme Court has also gone beyond upholding the 
right to protest as a fundamental right and has held that the State 
must aid the right to assembly of the citizens. In the Constitution 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
66 133 


Bench judgment, Himat Lal K. Shah v. Commr. of Police [(1973) 
1 SCC 227], while dealing with the challenge to the Rules framed 
under the Bombay Police Act regulating public meetings on streets, 
held that the Government has power to regulate which includes 
prohibition of public meetings on streets or highways to avoid 
nuisance or disruption to traffic and thus, it can provide a public 
meeting on roads, but it does not mean that the Government can 
close all the streets or open areas for public meetings, thus 
denying the fundamental right which flows from Articles 19(1)(a) 
and (b). The Court held: (SCC pp. 239 & 248, paras 33 & 70) 

"33. This is true but nevertheless the State cannot by 
law abridge or take away the right of assembly by 
prohibiting assembly on every public street or public 
place. The State can only make regulations in aid of 
the right of assembly of each citizen and can only 
impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public 
order. 

* * * 

70. Public meeting in open spaces and public streets 
forms part of the tradition of our national life. In the 
pre-Independence days such meetings have been held 
in open space and public streets and the people have 
come to regard it as a part of their privileges and 
immunities. The State and the local authority have a 
virtual monopoly of every open space at which an 
outdoor meeting can be held. If, therefore, the State or 
Municipality can constitutionally close both its streets 
and its parks entirely to public meetings, the practical 
result would be that it would be impossible to hold any 
open-air meetings in any large city. The real problem is 
that of reconciling the city's function of providing for 
the exigencies of traffic in its streets and for the 
recreation of the public in its parks, with its other 
obligations, of providing adequate places for public 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
67 133 


discussion in order to safeguard the guaranteed right 
of public assembly. The assumption made by Justice 
Holmes is that a city owns its parks and highways in the 
same sense and with the same rights as a private owner 
owns his property with the right to exclude or admit 
anyone he pleases. That may not accord with the 
concept of dedication of public streets and parks. The 
parks are held for public and the public streets are also 
held for the public. It is doubtless true that the State or 
local authority can regulate its property in order to 
serve its public purposes. Streets and public parks exist 
primarily for other purposes and the social interest 
promoted by untrammelled exercise of freedom of 
utterance and assembly in public street must yield to 
social interest which prohibition and regulation of 
speech are designed to protect. But there is a 
constitutional difference between reasonable regulation 
and arbitrary exclusion." 

"52. While adjudicating with respect to the validity of police action 
against protestors, this Court again reiterated that right to protest 
was a fundamental right guaranteed to the citizens under Article 
19. In Ramlila Maidan Incident, In re [(2012) 5 SCC 1], the Court 
observed that the right to assembly and peaceful agitations were 
basic features of a democratic system and the Government should 
encourage exercise of these rights: (SCC p. 99, para 245) 

"245. Freedom of speech, right to assemble and 
demonstrate by holding dharnas and peaceful 
agitations are the basic features of a democratic 
system. The people of a democratic country like ours 
have a right to raise their voice against the decisions 
and actions of the Government or even to express their 
resentment over the actions of the Government on any 
subject of social or national importance. The 
Government has to respect and, in fact, encourage 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
68 133 


exercise of such rights. It is the abundant duty of the 
State to aid the exercise of the right to freedom of speech 
as understood in its comprehensive sense and not to 
throttle or frustrate exercise of such rights by exercising 
its executive or legislative powers and passing orders or 
taking action in that direction in the name of reasonable 
restrictions. The preventive steps should be founded on 
actual and prominent threat endangering public order 
and tranquillity, as it may disturb the social order. This 
delegated power vested in the State has to be exercised 
with great caution and free from arbitrariness. It must 
serve the ends of the constitutional rights rather than to 
subvert them." 

"53. Further, in Anita Thakur [(2016) 15 SCC 525], the Court 
recognised that the right to peaceful protest was a fundamental 
right under Articles 19(1), (b) and (c) of the Constitution, subject to 
reasonable restrictions. It was finally held that in that while the 
protestors turned violent first, the police used excessive force: (SCC 
pp. 533-34, paras 12-13 & 15) 

"12. ..... The "right to assemble" is beautifully captured 
in an eloquent statement that "an unarmed, peaceful 
protest procession in the land of "salt satyagraha", fast-
unto-death and "do or die" is no jural anathema". It 
hardly needs elaboration that a distinguishing feature 
of any democracy is the space offered for legitimate 
dissent. One cherished and valuable aspect of political 
life in India is a tradition to express grievances through 
direct action or peaceful protest. Organised, non-violent 
protest marches were a key weapon in the struggle for 
Independence, and the right to peaceful protest is now 
recognised as a fundamental right in the Constitution. 

13. Notwithstanding above, it is also to be borne in 
mind that the aforesaid rights are subject to reasonable 
restrictions in the interest of the sovereignty and 

CRL.A. 39/2021

integrity of India, as well as public order. It is for this 
reason, the State authorities many a times designate 
particular areas and routes, dedicating them for the 
purpose of holding public meetings. 

* * * 

15. Thus, while on the one hand, citizens are guaranteed 
fundamental right of speech, right to assemble for the 
purpose of carrying peaceful protest processions and 
right of free movement, on the other hand, reasonable 
restrictions on such right can be put by law. Provisions 
of IPC and CrPC, discussed above, are in the form of 
statutory provisions giving powers to the State to 
ensure that such public assemblies, protests, dharnas 
or marches are peaceful and they do not become 
"unlawful". At the same time, while exercising such 
powers, the authorities are supposed to act within the 
limits of law and cannot indulge into excesses." 

* * * * * 

"61. Undoubtedly, right of people to hold peaceful protests and 
demonstrations, etc. is a fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 
19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b) of the Constitution. The question is as to 
whether disturbances, etc. caused by it to the residents, as mentioned 
in detail by the NGT, is a larger public interest which outweighs the 
rights of protestors to hold demonstrations at Jantar Mantar Road 
and, therefore, amounts to reasonable restriction in curbing such 
demonstrations. Here, we agree with the detailed reasoning given by 
the NGT that holding of demonstrations in the way it has been 
happening is causing serious discomfort and harassment to the 
residents. At the same time, it is also to be kept in mind that for quite 
some time Jantar Mantar has been chosen as a place for holding 
demonstrations and was earmarked by the authorities as well. Going 
by the dicta in Asha Ranjan [(2017) 4 SCC 397], principle of primacy 
cannot be given to one right whereby the right of the other gets totally 
extinguished. Total extinction is not balancing. Balancing would mean 
curtailing one right of one class to some extent so that the right of the 
other class is also protected. 

CRL.A. 39/2021

"62. We feel that the pathetic conditions which were caused as a 
result of the processions, demonstrations and agitations, etc. at the 
Jantar Mantar were primarily because of the reason that the 
authorities did not take necessary measures to regulate the same. 
Had adequate and sufficient steps been taken by the authorities to 
ensure that such dharnas and demonstrations are held within their 
bounds, it would have balanced the rights of protestors as well as the 
residents. For example, the dharnas and protests were allowed to be 
stretched almost on the entire Jantar Mantar Road, on both sides, and 
even across the width of the road. Instead, a particular area could 
have been earmarked for this purpose, sufficiently away from the 
houses, etc. so that there is no unnecessary blockage of roads and 
pathways. Likewise, the demonstrators were allowed to go on with 
nonstop slogans, even at odd hours, at night, and that too with the use 
of loudspeakers, etc. The authorities could have ensured that such 
slogans are within the parameters of noise pollution norms and there 
are no shoutings or slogans at night hours or early morning hours. 
Again, these dharnas, agitations and processions could be prohibited 
on certain occasions, for example, whenever some foreign dignitaries 
visit and pass through the said area or other such sensitive occasions. 
The authorities could also ensure that the protestors do not bring their 
trucks/buses, etc. and park those vehicles in and around the residential 
buildings; the protestors are not allowed to pitch up their tents and 
stay for days together; they are not allowed to bathe or wash their 
clothes using Delhi Jal Board tankers or defecate in the open, on 
pavements; and do not create any unhygienic situations. The 
authorities could also examine, while allowing such demonstration, as 
to the number of protestors who are likely to participate and could 
refuse permission to hold any such demonstration, etc. when the 
number is going to be abnormally large which, if allowed, would per 
se create hardships of various kinds to the residents. These are some of 
the examples given by us. The underlying message is that certain 
categories of peaceful protests and demonstrations, in a guarded and 
regulated manner, could be allowed so as to enable the protestors to 
exercise their right and, at the same time, ensuring that no 
inconvenience of any kind is caused to the residents. 

* * * * * 

"64. At this juncture, while discussing the aspect of balancing of the 
two rights, we have to keep in mind certain other relevant factors as 
well. In the first instance, what needs to be noted is that a portion of 
Ramlila Maidan has been earmarked for such demonstrations, etc. 
Therefore, that space is already available. One of the arguments 
raised by the petitioner in the writ petition and the appellants in the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
71 133 


appeal is that Ramlila Maidan is far away from that portion of New 
Delhi area where there is a concentration of "power" and, therefore, 
holding protests and demonstration at a far place in Ramlila Maidan 
would have no impact or very little effect. It was stressed that the 
purpose of holding such demonstrations and raising slogans is that 
they reach persons concerned for whom these are meant. This may be 
correct. However, it is also to be borne in mind that we are living in 
an era of technology where a concerned voice by a group of persons 
can reach the right quarters by numerous means. Electronic and 
print media play a pivotal role. Then, we have social media and 
various applications like "WhatsApp", "Twitter", "Instagram", etc. 
which take no time in spreading such events. ......." 

(emphasis supplied) 

True connotation of 'terrorist act' & 
do accusations make-out an offence 
under UAPA 

47. First and foremost, this court would be required to consider whether the 

allegations against the appellant in the subject charge-sheet make-out 

any offence under Chapters IV and/or VI of the UAPA, and if so, which 

offence or offences are disclosed. As seen from the discussion above, 

the offences alleged against the appellant under Chapter IV are 

offences under sections 15, 17 and 18, all of which fall under Chapter 

IV of the UAPA. Section 15 engrafts the offence of 'terrorist act', 

section 17 lays-down the punishment for raising funds for committing a 

terrorist act and section 18 engrafts the offence of 'punishment for 

conspiracy etc. to commit a terrorist act or any act preparatory to 

commit a terrorist act'. At this point, we would remind ourselves that 

'terrorist act', including conspiracy and act preparatory to the 

commission of a terrorist act, were brought within the purview of the 

UAPA by an amendment made in 2004, on the heels of the Parliament 

repealing POTA in the year 2004, TADA having already been repealed 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
72 133 


in 1995. Evidently therefore, the phrase 'terrorist act' must get its 

colour and flavour from the problem of terrorism as was earlier 

addressed by the Parliament under TADA and POTA. 

48. Though, as seen above, the phrase 'terrorist act' has been defined in a 

very wide and detailed manner within section 15 itself, in our opinion, 

the court must be careful in employing the definitional words and 

phrases used in section 15 in their absolute literal sense or use them 

lightly in a manner that would trivialise the extremely heinous offence 

of 'terrorist act', without understanding how terrorism is different even 

from conventional, heinous crime. 

49. As observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur 

(supra), the extent and reach of terrorist activity must travel beyond the 

effect of an ordinary crime and must not arise merely by causing 

disturbance of law and order or even public order; and must be such 

that it travels beyond the capacity of the ordinary law enforcement 

agencies to deal with it under the ordinary penal law. The following 

words of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur 

(supra) bear repetition: 

"…'terrorism' is generally an attempt to acquire or maintain power or 
control by intimidation and causing fear and helplessness in the minds of 
the people at large or any section thereof and is a totally abnormal 
phenomenon …". 

(emphasis supplied) 

50. Furthermore, in the same judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court says: 

"...it is not the intention of the Legislature that every criminal should be 
tried under TADA, where the fall out of his activity does not extend beyond 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
73 133 


the normal frontiers of the ordinary criminal activity. Every 'terrorist' 
may be a criminal but every criminal cannot be given the label of a 
'terrorist' only to set in motion the more stringent provisions of TADA 
…" 

(emphasis supplied) 

51. The same sense and meaning has been echoed by the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court in PUCL (supra) where, quoting Mohd. Iqbal M Shaikh, the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court says: 

"…it may be possible to describe it as use of violence when its most 
important result is not merely the physical and mental damage of the 
victim but the prolonged psychological effect it produces or has the 
potential of producing on the society as a whole …" 

(emphasis supplied) 

52. Furthermore, in PUCL (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court also 

observes that: 

"... Terrorist acts are meant to destabilise the nation by 
challenging its sovereignty and integrity, to raze the 
constitutional principles that we hold dear, to create a psyche 
of fear and anarchism among common people, to tear apart 
the secular fabric, to overthrow democratically elected 
government, to promote prejudice and bigotry, to demoralise 
the security forces, to thwart the economic progress and 
development and so on. This cannot be equated with a usual 
law and order problem within a State. On the other hand, it is 
inter-State, international or cross-border in character. Fight 
against the overt and covert acts of terrorism is not a regular 
criminal justice endeavour. Rather, it is defence of our nation 
and its citizens. It is a challenge to the whole nation and 
invisible force of Indianness that binds this great nation 
together ..." 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
74 133 


(emphasis supplied) 

53. Again, in Yakub Abdul Razak Memon (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court refers to acts of terrorism by saying that: 

"... Acts of terrorism can range from threats to actual assassinations, 
kidnappings, airline hijackings, bomb scares, car bombs, building 
explosions, mailing of dangerous materials, computer based attacks and 
the use of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons-weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD)" 

(emphasis supplied) 

54. In our view therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the definition of 

'terrorist act' in section 15 UAPA is wide and even somewhat vague, 

the phrase must partake of the essential character of terrorism and the 

phrase 'terrorist act' cannot be permitted to be casually applied to 

criminal acts or omissions that fall squarely within the definition of 

conventional offences as defined inter alia under the IPC. We remind 

ourselves of the principle laid down by the Constitution Bench of the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court in A.K. Roy (supra) where it said that the 

requirement that crimes must be defined with an appropriate 

definitiveness is a fundamental concept of criminal law and must be 

regarded as a pervading theme of our Constitution since the decision 

in Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India ; and that the underlying 

34 

principle is that every person is entitled to be informed as to what the 

State commands or permits and the life and liberty of the person 

cannot be put on peril of an ambiguity. The Constitution Bench 

further says that to stand true to this principle what is expected is that 

the language of the law must contain adequate warning of the conduct 

1978 (1) SCC 248 

34 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
75 133 


which may fall within the proscribed area 'when measured by common 

understanding'. Most importantly, the Constitution Bench observes, 

and it is imperative that we extract the words again: 

"... These expressions, though they are difficult to define, do not 
elude a just application to practical situations. The use of language 
carries with it the inconvenience of the imperfections of 
language...". 

"...We must, however, utter a word of caution that since the concepts 
are not defined, undoubtedly because they are not capable of a 
precise definition, courts must strive to give to those concepts a 
narrower construction than what the literal words suggest ...". 

55. Also noteworthy are the words of another Constitution Bench of the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sanjay Dutt (supra) to the effect that when 

law visits a person with serious penal consequences, the courts must 

take extra care to ensure that those to whom the legislature did not 

intend to be covered by the express language of the statute "are not 

roped in by stretching the law". 

56. It is therefore clearly the position in our jurisprudence that where a 

provision of law engrafting serious penal consequences is vague, such 

provision must be construed narrowly in order to bring it within the 

constitutional framework; and must be applied in a just and fair way, 

lest it unjustly ropes within its ambit persons whom the Legislature 

never intended to punish. Where the court finds that an act or omission 

is adequately addressed and dealt with by the ordinary penal law of the 

land, the court must not countenance a State agency 'crying wolf'. 

57. In our opinion, the intent and purport of the Parliament in enacting the 

UAPA, and more specifically in amending it in 2004 and 2008 to bring 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
76 133 


terrorist activity within its scope, was, and could only have had been, to 

deal with matters of profound impact on the 'Defence of India', 

nothing more and nothing less. Absent this, UAPA could not have been 

enacted by the Parliament since the only entries in List-I of the Seventh 

Schedule to the Constitution that would bring the statute within the 

legislative competence of the Parliament are Entry 1 read with Entry 93 

relating to the Defence of India and offences with respect to the 

Defence of India. It was neither the intent nor purport of enacting 

UAPA that other offences of the usual and ordinary kind, however 

grave, egregious or heinous in their nature and extent, should also be 

covered by UAPA, since such conventional matters would have fallen 

within Entry 1 of List-II (State List) and/or Entry 1 of List-III 

(Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule to our Constitution. In order 

to lean in favour of constitutionality of the provisions of section 15, 17 

and 18 of the UAPA, as we must, it must be taken that the Parliament 

acted within the realm of its legislative competence and that UAPA 

came to be enacted and amended in 2004 and 2008 to address issues 

relating to the 'Defence of India'. 

58. In the above view of the scope and ambit of UAPA, and in particular 

sections 15, 17 and 18 thereof, and based on the allegations made in the 

subject charge-sheet against the appellant as highlighted before us on 

behalf of the State, what we find is the following: 

(a) 
The essential aim and intent of the activities, in which the 

appellant is alleged to have been involved, was to orchestrate 

and participate in a protest across the city of Delhi to oppose 

the enactment of the CAA, which was perceived as a law 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
77 133 


intended to deprive members of the Muslim community of 

citizenship of the Republic of India; 

(b) 
The allegation is that, alongwith co-conspirators, the 

appellant engaged in various steps and actions, the object of 

which was to organise a protest and take it to a crescendo that 

would lead to a chakkajam, namely to cause complete 

stoppage of vehicles and blockade of roads, so that supplies 

and services to the people of Delhi are adversely affected; 

and also to spread fear and cause riots; 

(c) 
There is no allegation in the subject charge-sheet that the 

appellant was leading the co-conspirators, who are alleged to 

have been indulging in the aforestated acts; nor that he had 

formed the JCC; nor that he was even the group 

administrator of any of the WhatsApp groups, which, the 

allegation goes, were formed with the sinister aim of 

organising a protest against the CAA that would cause havoc 

amongst the ordinary citizenry; 

(d) 
The appellant is stated to be a member of the SIO and the 

JCC, admittedly neither of which is a banned organisation or 

terrorist organisation listed in the First Schedule to the 

UAPA. The JCC in fact is not even an organisation but only 

an inchoate committee, defined perhaps only by the 

WhatsApp group that it runs; 

(e) 
The common refrain running through the subject charge-

sheet, as seen from the extracts cited and relied upon by the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
78 133 


State, is that the appellant's co-conspirators directed and 

instructed him to do certain things, including to visit Muslim 

areas, coordinate with local Imams, and help in orchestrating 

the anti-CAA protests at various locations in Delhi; 

(f) 
There is no allegation in the subject charge-sheet that the 

anti-CAA protest extended even to the whole of the National 

Capital Territory of Delhi; and a perusal of the subject 

charge-sheet shows that the protest and the disruptions it is 

alleged to have caused were restricted to North-East Delhi. It 

would therefore be a stretch to say that the protest affected 

the community at large for it to qualify as an act of terror; 

(g) 
In fact, from the extracts of the subject charge-sheet cited on 

behalf of the State, which are the most material allegations 

against the appellant, this court is able to discern only one 

specific, particular and overt act that the appellant is stated 

to have committed, namely that he handed over a SIM card 

given to him by someone else, to a co-conspirator / co-

accused, which, it is further alleged, was used by the said co-

accused to send messages on a WhatsApp group. Other than 

this one action that is specifically attributed to the appellant, 

this court is unable to discern any other act or omission 

attributed specifically to the appellant; 

(h) 
Furthermore, there is no allegation whatsoever that the arms, 

ammunition and other articles, that were supposedly to be 

used as weapons, were recovered from or at the instance of 

the appellant. In this context the provisions of section 43E of 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
79 133 


the UAPA may be noted, which contain a presumption 

against an accused person, to the effect that unless the 

contrary is shown, the court shall presume that the accused 

had committed an offence under section 15 provided it is 

proved that the arms, explosives or other substances were 

recovered from the possession of the accused and there is 

reason to believe that these were used in the commission of 

the offence; or finger prints or other definitive evidence 

suggesting involvement of the accused was found at the site 

of the offence. In the present case, since there is not even a 

whisper of an allegation that any of the articles referred to 

above were even recovered from the possession or at the 

instance of the appellant, the question of any presumption 

arising under section 43E does not arise; 

(i) 
The State is at pains to argue that section 15 contemplates not 

only an act 'with intent to threaten' the foundations of a 

nation but also any act 'likely to threaten' such foundations. 

It is further stressed that not only is the 'intent to strike 

terror' outlawed under section 15 but also an act that is 

'likely to strike terror'. The point sought to be made is that 

even the likelihood that the appellant's acts or omissions may 

threaten the nation are an offence within the meaning of 

sections 15 and 18 of the UAPA. Having given our anxious 

consideration to this aspect of 'likelihood' of threat and 

terror, we are of the view that the foundations of our nation 

stand on surer footing than to be likely to be shaken by a 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
80 133 


protest, however vicious, organised by a tribe of college 

students or other persons, operating as a coordination 

committee from the confines of a University situate in the 

heart of Delhi; 

(j) 
It has been a recurrent theme, repeatedly urged by the State, 

that what was contemplated and in fact brought to fruition 

was not a typical protest but an aggravated protest which 

was intended to disrupt the life of the community in Delhi. 

We find ourselves unpersuaded and unconvinced with this 

submission since we find it is not founded on any specific 

factual allegation and we are of the view that the mere use of 

alarming and hyperbolic verbiage in the subject charge-sheet 

will not convince us otherwise. In fact, upon a closer scrutiny 

of the submissions made on behalf of the State, we find that 

the submissions are based upon inferences drawn by the 

prosecuting agency and not upon factual allegations; 

(k) 
It is the admitted position that the protest that is alleged to 

have been the culmination of the so-called conspiracy, in 

which inter alia the appellant participated, was neither 

banned nor outlawed. The protest was monitored by law 

enforcement agencies; and it is precisely by reason of 

disorderliness of the protest that the appellant is also an 

accused in another FIR bearing No. 298/2019 dated 

16.12.2019, in which however the appellant has already been 

enlarged on bail vidé order dated 28.05.2020 by the learned 

ASJ, Saket District Courts, New Delhi; 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
81 133 


(l) 

In the statutory framework of the now repealed TADA and 

POTA, before allowing a bail plea, the court was required to 

assess whether the accused person was 'not guilty' of the 

offence alleged; and therefore the burden was clearly on the 

defence to disprove the allegations on a prima facie basis. 

Correspondingly therefore, under section 43D(5) of the 

UAPA, where, before allowing a bail plea, the court is 

required to assess if the accusation against an accused is 

prima facie true, the burden to demonstrate the prima facie 

veracity of the allegation must fall upon the prosecution. The 

requirement of being satisfied that an accused is 'not guilty' 

under TADA or POTA meant that the court must have 

reasons to prima facie exclude guilt; whereas the requirement 

of believing an accusation to be 'prima facie true' would 

mean that the court must have reason to prima facie accept 

guilt of the accused persons, even if on broad probabilities; 

(m) 
The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Watali (supra) 

proscribes the court from delving into the merits or demerits 

of the evidence at the stage of deciding a bail plea; and as a 

sequitur, for assessing the prima facie veracity of the 

accusations, the court would equally not delve into the 

suspicions and inferences that the prosecution may seek to 

draw from the evidence and other material placed with the 

subject charge-sheet. To bring its case within Chapter IV of 

the UAPA the State must therefore, without calling upon the 

court to draw inferences and conclusions, show that the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
82 133 


accusations made against the appellant prima facie disclose 

the commission of a 'terrorist act' or a 'conspiracy' or an 'act 

preparatory' to the commission of a terrorist act. 

59. In so far as the reliance placed by the State on the decision in Ghulam 

Mohd. Bhat (supra) is concerned, to which decision one of us was a 

member, we need only say that in that case charges had already been 

framed against the appellant therein and two co-accused had already 

pleaded guilty; whereby, after appreciating the evidence adduced 

alongwith the charge-sheet, the Special Court had already determined 

that the accusations against the appellant therein were prima facie true; 

and the order framing charges was not under challenge before the High 

Court. 

60. In this case, we find that the State's attempt to show that the 

accusations made against the appellant are prima facie true, does not 

commend itself for acceptance. 

61. Once we are of the opinion, as we are in the present case, that there are 

no reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against the 

appellant are prima facie true, the Proviso to section 43D(5) would not 

apply; and we must therefore fall back upon the general principles of 

grant or denial of bail to an accused person charged with certain 

offences. 

Right to Protest 

62. Since this matter emanates from a protest organised by certain persons, 

which the State alleges, was no ordinary protest but one that has shaken 

or is likely to have shaken, the entire foundations of our Republic, we 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
83 133 


feel compelled to discuss what might be the permissible contours of a 

protest that would not threaten our nation. 

63. In this context we examined, when, the constitutionally guaranteed 

right to protest, which derives from the rights under Article 19(1)(b) of 

the Constitution to "assemble peaceably and without arms", crosses the 

line and ventures into commission of a cognizable offence under the 

ordinary penal law; and even more so, when, the right to protest further 

crosses into the territory of becoming a terrorist act or a conspiracy or 

an act preparatory to commission of a terrorist act under the UAPA. 

64. The observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mazdoor Kisan 

Shakti Sangathan (supra) appear to us to be the most lucid and pithy 

answer as to the contours of legitimate protest and these bear repetition. 

In the said decision the Hon'ble Supreme Court says that legitimate 

dissent is a distinguishable feature of any democracy and the question 

is not whether the issue raised by the protestors is right or wrong or 

whether it is justified or unjustified, people have the right to express 

their views; and a particular cause, which in the first instance, may 

appear to be insignificant or irrelevant may gain momentum and 

acceptability when it is duly voiced and debated. The Hon'ble Supreme 

Court further says that a demonstration may take various forms : it may 

be noisy, disorderly and even violent, in which case it would not fall 

within the permissible limits of Articles 19(1)(a) or 19(1)(b) and in 

such case the Government has the power to regulate, including 

prohibit, such protest or demonstration. The Government may even 

prohibit public meetings, demonstrations or protests on streets or 

highways to avoid nuisance or disturbance of traffic but the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
84 133 


Government cannot close all streets or open areas for public meetings 

thereby defeating the fundamental right that flows from Articles 19(1) 

(a) and 19(1)(b) of the Constitution. 

65. Assuming, without however expressing any opinion thereon, that in the 

present case the protest in question crossed the limit of what is 

permissible under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b) and went into the 

forbidden realm of a non-peaceful protest, first of all there is nothing to 

show that the Government had prohibited the protest at the relevant 

time, much less is there anything to show that the appellant was the 

perpetrator or conspirator or was involved in any illegal protest. In any 

case, whatever offences are alleged to have been committed by reason 

of the protests having turned non-peaceful are subject matter of F.I.R. 

No. 298/2019, in which the appellant is an accused and in which he has 

already been admitted to bail and will face trial in due course. There is 

absolutely nothing in the subject charge-sheet, by way of any specific 

or particularised allegation that would show the possible commission of 

a 'terrorist act' within the meaning of section 15 UAPA; or an act of 

'raising funds' to commit a terrorist act under section 17; or an act of 

'conspiracy' to commit or an 'act preparatory' to commit, a terrorist act 

within the meaning of section 18 UAPA. We are unable to discern in 

the subject charge-sheet the elemental factual ingredients that are a 

must to found the offences defined under section 15, 17 or 18 UAPA. 

66. In our view, on an objective reading of the allegations contained in the 

subject charge-sheet, there is complete lack of any specific, 

particularised, factual allegations, that is to say allegations other than 

those sought to be spun by mere grandiloquence, contained in the 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
85 133 


subject charge-sheet that would make-out the ingredients of the 

offences under sections 15, 17 or 18 UAPA. Foisting extremely grave 

and serious penal provisions engrafted in sections 15, 17 and 18 UAPA 

frivolously upon people, would undermine the intent and purpose of the 

Parliament in enacting a law that is meant to address threats to the very 

existence of our Nation. Wanton use of serious penal provisions would 

only trivialise them. Whatever other offence(s) the appellant may or 

may not have committed, at least on a prima facie view, the State has 

been unable to persuade us that the accusations against the appellant 

show commission of offences under sections 15, 17 or 18 UAPA. 

67. On another note, the learned ASG has attempted to distinguish the 

decision of a 3-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in K. A. 

Najeeb (supra), submitting that that decision came to be made in the 

backdrop of an extended period of incarceration of the accused person 

as an undertrial and there being no likelihood of the trial being 

completed in a reasonable time. This, the learned ASG says, is not the 

case in the present matter. As presently advised, though the subject 

charge-sheet has been filed, there are some 740 prosecution witnesses, 

including public witnesses, protected witnesses, police witnesses cited 

in it; and trial is yet to commence. Should this court then wait until the 

appellant has languished in prison for a long enough time to be able to 

see that it will be impossible to complete the deposition of 740 

prosecution witnesses in any foreseeable future, especially in view of 

the prevailing pandemic when all proceedings in the trial are effectively 

stalled? Should this court wait till the appellant's right to a speedy trial 

guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution is fully and completely 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
86 133 


negated, before it steps in and wakes-up to such violation? We hardly 

think that that would be the desirable course of action. In our view the 

court must exercise foresight and see that trial in the subject charge-

sheet will not see conclusion for many-many years to come; which 

warrants, nay invites, the application of the principles laid down by the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court in K. A. Najeeb (supra). 

68. Since we are of the view that no offence under sections 15, 17 or 18 

UAPA is made-out against the appellant on a prima facie appreciation 

of the subject charge-sheet and the material collected and cited by the 

prosecution, the additional limitations and restrictions for grant of bail 

under section 43D(5) UAPA do not apply; and the court may therefore 

fall back upon the usual and ordinary considerations for bail under the 

Cr.P.C. 

69. In this behalf the submission made on behalf of the State, which we 

must address, is that the High Court while deciding an appeal under 

section 21 of the NIA Act must consider the grant or denial of bail only 

within the parameters of section 437 Cr.P.C. and not section 439 

Cr.P.C. since the High Court is seized of an appeal arising from the 

Special Court, which (latter) has acted under section 437 Cr.P.C., since 

in dealing with a case under the UAPA, the Special Court is not a Court 

of Sessions. Although, the learned ASG contends that this is the 

principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kartar Singh 

(supra), we are unable to find any precept to that effect laid down in 

Kartar Singh (supra). Moreover, to say that while considering a bail 

plea, even if in an appeal under section 21 of the NIA Act, the High 

Court would be constrained by the restrictive power for bail under 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
87 133 


section 437 Cr.P.C., in our view, does violence both to the express 

wording of section 437 Cr.P.C. as also to the wider powers of the High 

Court with regard to bail under section 439 Cr.P.C. It requires to be 

noticed that section 439 Cr.P.C. in so many words applies to "a Court 

other than the High Court or Court of Sessions". These words in 

section 437 Cr.P.C. cannot be deemed to have been amended by any 

provision of the NIA Act or the UAPA. Moreover, it does not appeal to 

our sense of reason, that when dealing with a bail plea in an appeal 

under section 21 of the NIA Act, the High Court would be bereft of its 

own powers under section 439 Cr.P.C., or absent even those powers, 

would be unable to act ex debito justitiae in exercise of its inherent 

powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. In our view therefore, regardless of 

the fact that the present case arises as an appeal under section 21 of the 

NIA Act, since the additional constraints of section 43D(5) of UAPA do 

not apply, this court would be entitled to consider the matter of bail on 

the touchstone of the provisions of section 439 Cr.P.C. 

70. In this behalf, we remind ourselves of the following precepts laid down 

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for grant or denial of bail. 

General Principles of Bail 

71. A quick conspectus of the general principles for considering a bail plea 

would not be out of place at this point. Outlining the considerations for 

bail, in Ash Mohammad vs. Shiv Raj Singh & Anr. the Supreme 

35 

Court expressed itself as follows: 

(2012) 9 SCC 446 

35 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
88 133 


"8. In Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh , it has been 

36 

opined that the grant of bail though involves exercise of 
discretionary power of the Court, such exercise of discretion has to 
be made in a judicious manner and not as a matter of course. The 
heinous nature of the crime warrants more caution and there is 
greater chance of rejection of bail, though, however dependent on 
the factual matrix of the matter. In the said case the learned Judges 
referred to the decision in Prahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT, Delhi and 
stated as follows: (Ram Govind case, SCC p. 602, para 4) 

"(a) While granting bail the court has to keep in mind not only 
the nature of the accusations, but the severity of the 
punishment, if the accusation entails a conviction and the 
nature of evidence in support of the accusations. 

(b) Reasonable apprehensions of the witnesses being tampered 
with or the apprehension of there being a threat for the 
complainant should also weigh with the court in the matter of 
grant of bail. 

(c) While it is not expected to have the entire evidence 
establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt 
but there ought always to be a prima facie satisfaction of the 
court in support of the charge. 

(d) Frivolity in prosecution should always be considered and it 
is only the element of genuineness that shall have to be 
considered in the matter of grant of bail, and in the event of 
there being some doubt as to the genuineness of the 
prosecution, in the normal course of events, the accused is 
entitled to an order of bail." 

"9. In Chaman Lal v. State of U.P. this Court while dealing with an 

37 

application for bail has stated that certain factors are to be 
considered for grant of bail, they are: (SCC p. 525) 

(2002) 3 SCC 598 

36 

(2004) 7 SCC 525 

37 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
89 133 


"… (i) the nature of accusation and the severity of punishment 
in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence, 
(ii) reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witness or 
apprehension of threat to the complainant, and (iii) prima 
facie satisfaction of the court in support of the charge." 

"10. In Masroor v. State of U.P. , while giving emphasis to 

38 

ascribing reasons for granting of bail, however, brief it may be, a 
two-Judge Bench observed that: (SCC p. 290, para 15) 

"15. There is no denying the fact that the liberty of an 
individual is precious and is to be zealously protected by the 
courts. Nonetheless, such a protection cannot be absolute in 
every situation. The valuable right of liberty of an individual 
and the interest of the society in general has to be balanced. 
Liberty of a person accused of an offence would depend upon 
the exigencies of the case." 

"11. In Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee it has been 

39 

observed that (SCC p. 499, para 9) normally this Court does not 
interfere with an order passed by the High Court granting or 
rejecting the bail of the accused, however, it is equally incumbent 
upon the High Court to exercise its discretion judiciously, cautiously 
and strictly in compliance with the basic principles laid down in a 
plethora of decisions of this Court on the point. 

"9. … among other circumstances, the factors [which are] to 
be borne in mind while considering an application for bail 
are: 

(i) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to 
believe that the accused had committed the offence; 

(ii) nature and gravity of the accusation; 

(iii) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction;

(2010) 14 SCC 496 

39

90 133 


(iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if released 
on bail; 

(v) character, behaviour, means, position and standing of the 
accused; 

(vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated; 

(vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being 
influenced; and 

(viii) danger, of course, of justice being thwarted by grant of 
bail." 

* * * * * * 

"20. Having said about the sanctity of liberty and the restrictions 
imposed by law and the necessity of collective security, we may 
proceed to state as to what is the connotative concept of bail. In 
Halsbury's Laws of England it has been stated thus: 

"166. Effect of bail.-The effect of granting bail is not to set 
the defendant [(accused) at liberty], but to release him from 
the custody of the law and to entrust him to the custody of his 
sureties, who are bound to produce him to appear at his trial 
at a specified time and place. The sureties may seize their 
principal at any time and may discharge themselves by 
handing him over to the custody of law, and he will then be 
imprisoned…." 

"21. In Sunil Fulchand Shah v. Union of India Dr A.S. Anand, 

40 

learned Chief Justice, in his concurring opinion, observed: (SCC pp. 
429-30, para 24) 

"24. … Bail is well understood in criminal jurisprudence and 
Chapter 33 of the Code of Criminal Procedure contains 
elaborate provisions relating to grant of bail. Bail is granted 
to a person who has been arrested in a non-bailable offence or 
has been convicted of an offence after trial. The effect of 

(2000) 3 SCC 409 

40 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
91 133 


granting bail is to release the accused from internment though 
the court would still retain constructive control over him 
through the sureties. In case the accused is released on his 
own bond such constructive control could still be exercised 
through the conditions of the bond secured from him. The 
literal meaning of the word 'bail' is surety." 

(emphasis supplied) 

72. In a recent decision in Sanjay Chandra vs. CBI the Supreme Court 

41 

has held that : 

"21. In bail applications, generally, it has been laid down from the 
earliest times that the object of bail is to secure the appearance of 
the accused person at his trial by reasonable amount of bail. The 
object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative. Deprivation of 
liberty must be considered a punishment, unless it is required to 
ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon. 
The courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that 
punishment begins after conviction, and that every man is deemed 
to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty. 

"22. From the earliest times, it was appreciated that detention in 
custody pending completion of trial could be a cause of great 
hardship. From time to time, necessity demands that some 
unconvicted persons should be held in custody pending trial to 
secure their attendance at the trial but in such cases, "necessity" is 
the operative test. In this country, it would be quite contrary to the 
concept of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution that any 
person should be punished in respect of any matter, upon which, he 
has not been convicted or that in any circumstances, he should be 
deprived of his liberty upon only the belief that he will tamper with 
the witnesses if left at liberty, save in the most extraordinary 
circumstances. 

(2012) 1 SCC 40 

41 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
92 133 


"23. Apart from the question of prevention being the object of 
refusal of bail, one must not lose sight of the fact that any 
imprisonment before conviction has a substantial punitive content 
and it would be improper for any court to refuse bail as a mark of 
disapproval of former conduct whether the accused has been 
convicted for it or not or to refuse bail to an unconvicted person 
for the purpose of giving him a taste of imprisonment as a lesson. 

"24. In the instant case, we have already noticed that the "pointing 
finger of accusation" against the appellants is "the seriousness of 
the charge". The offences alleged are economic offences which have 
resulted in loss to the State exchequer. Though, they contend that 
there is a possibility of the appellants tampering with the witnesses, 
they have not placed any material in support of the allegation. In 
our view, seriousness of the charge is, no doubt, one of the relevant 
considerations while considering bail applications but that is not 
the only test or the factor: the other factor that also requires to be 
taken note of is the punishment that could be imposed after trial and 
conviction, both under the Penal Code and the Prevention of 
Corruption Act. Otherwise, if the former is the only test, we would 
not be balancing the constitutional rights but rather "recalibrating 
the scales of justice"." 

* * * * * 

"39. Coming back to the facts of the present case, both the courts 
have refused the request for grant of bail on two grounds: the 
primary ground is that the offence alleged against the accused 
persons is very serious involving deep-rooted planning in which, 
huge financial loss is caused to the State exchequer; the secondary 
ground is that of the possibility of the accused persons tampering 
with the witnesses. In the present case, the charge is that of cheating 
and dishonestly inducing delivery of property and forgery for the 
purpose of cheating using as genuine a forged document. The 
punishment for the offence is imprisonment for a term which may 
extend to seven years. It is, no doubt, true that the nature of the 
charge may be relevant, but at the same time, the punishment to 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
93 133 


which the party may be liable, if convicted, also bears upon the 
issue. Therefore, in determining whether to grant bail, both the 
seriousness of the charge and the severity of the punishment should 
be taken into consideration." 

* * * * * 

"46. We are conscious of the fact that the accused are charged with 
economic offences of huge magnitude. We are also conscious of the 
fact that the offences alleged, if proved, may jeopardise the economy 
of the country. At the same time, we cannot lose sight of the fact that 
the investigating agency has already completed investigation and 
the charge-sheet is already filed before the Special Judge, CBI, 
New Delhi. Therefore, their presence in the custody may not be 
necessary for further investigation. We are of the view that the 
appellants are entitled to the grant of bail pending trial on stringent 
conditions in order to ally the apprehension expressed by CBI." 

(emphasis supplied) 

73. Most recently, in P. Chidambaram vs. CBI the Supreme Court has 

42 

held : 

"22. The jurisdiction to grant bail has to be exercised on the basis 
of the well-settled principles having regard to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. The following factors are to be taken 
into consideration while considering an application for bail:-(i) the 
nature of accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case 
of conviction and the nature of the materials relied upon by the 
prosecution; (ii) reasonable apprehension of tampering with the 
witnesses or apprehension of threat to the complainant or the 
witnesses; (iii) reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the 
accused at the time of trial or the likelihood of his abscondence; 
(iv) character behaviour and standing of the accused and the 
circumstances which are peculiar to the accused; (v) larger interest 

2019 SCC OnLine SC 1380 

42 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
94 133 


of the public or the State and similar other considerations (vide 
Prahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT, Delhi). There is no hard and fast rule 
regarding grant or refusal to grant bail. Each case has to be 
considered on the facts and circumstances of each case and on its 
own merits. The discretion of the court has to be exercised 
judiciously and not in an arbitrary manner. ....." 

* * * * * 

"33. The appellant is not a "flight risk" and in view of the 
conditions imposed, there is no possibility of his abscondence from 
the trial. Statement of the prosecution that the appellant has 
influenced the witnesses and there is likelihood of his further 
influencing the witnesses cannot be the ground to deny bail to the 
appellant particularly, when there is no such whisper in the six 
remand applications filed by the prosecution. The charge-sheet has 
been filed against the appellant and other co-accused on 
18.10.2019. The appellant is in custody from 21.08.2019 for about 
two months. The co-accused were already granted bail. The 
appellant is said to be aged 74 years and is also said to be suffering 
from age related health problems. Considering the above factors 
and the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that 
the appellant is entitled to be granted bail." 

(emphasis supplied) 

74. Furthermore in P. Chidambaram vs. Directorate of Enforcement , the 

43 

Supreme Court has explained the concept and application of 'gravity' 

of an offence in the following way : 

"12. …. The gravity can only beget the length of sentence provided 
in law and by asserting that the offence is grave, the grant of bail 
cannot be thwarted. The respondent cannot contend as if the 
appellant should remain in custody till the trial is over. 

* * * * * * 

2019 SCC OnLine SC 1549 

43 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
95 133 


"23. …. Keeping in view the consequences that would befall on the 
society in cases of financial irregularities, it has been held that even 
economic offences would fall under the category of "grave offence" 
and in such circumstance while considering the application for bail 
in such matters, the Court will have to deal with the same, being 
sensitive to the nature of allegation made against the accused. One 
of the circumstances to consider the gravity of the offence is also the 
term of sentence that is prescribed for the offence the accused is 
alleged to have committed. Such consideration with regard to the 
gravity of offence is a factor which is in addition to the triple test or 
the tripod test that would be normally applied. In that regard what is 
also to be kept in perspective is that even if the allegation is one of 
grave economic offence, it is not a rule that bail should be denied in 
every case since there is no such bar created in the relevant 
enactment passed by the legislature nor does the bail jurisprudence 
provides so. Therefore, the underlining conclusion is that 
irrespective of the nature and gravity of charge, the precedent of 
another case alone will not be the basis for either grant or refusal of 
bail though it may have a bearing on principle. But ultimately the 
consideration will have to be on case to case basis on the facts 
involved therein and securing the presence of the accused to stand 
trial." 

(emphasis supplied) 

75. Commenting on the consequences of pre-trial detention, in Moti Ram 

vs. State of M.P. the Supreme Court said : 

44 

"14. The consequences of pre-trial detention are grave. Defendants 
presumed innocent are subjected to the psychological and physical 
deprivations of jail life, usually under more onerous conditions than 
are imposed on convicted defendants. The jailed defendant loses his 
job if he has one and is prevented from contributing to the 
preparation of his defence. Equally important, the burden of his 

(1978) 4 SCC 47 

44 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
96 133 


detention frequently falls heavily on the innocent members of his 
family." 

(emphasis supplied) 

76. In Babu Singh vs. State of U.P. the Supreme Court observed : 

45 

"18. We must weigh the contrary factors to answer the test of 
reasonableness, subject to the need for securing the presence of the 
bail applicant. It makes sense to assume that a man on bail has a 
better chance to prepare or present his case than one remanded in 
custody. And if public justice is to be promoted, mechanical 
detention should be demoted. ......... The considerable public expense 
in keeping in custody where no danger of disappearance or 
disturbance can arise, is not a negligible consideration. Equally 
important is the deplorable condition, verging on the inhuman, of 
our sub-jails, that the unrewarding cruelty and expensive custody of 
avoidable incarceration makes refusal of bail unreasonable and a 
policy favouring release justly sensible." 

(emphasis supplied) 

Conclusions 

77. Upon a conspectus of the general law relating to bail and applying 

these well-worn principles to the present case, in our view, though 

during trial the State will no doubt attempt to marshal evidence and 

make good the allegations made against the appellant, as we speak now 

these are mere allegations and, as discussed above, we are not 

convinced prima facie of the veracity of the allegations so made. 

Charge-sheet dated 16.09.2020 has already been filed in the matter. 

Some 740 witnesses have been cited in the subject charge-sheet. Trial is 

yet to commence. In view of the truncated functioning of courts by 

(1978) 1 SCC 579 

45 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
97 133 


reason of the prevailing second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is 

unlikely that trial will commence anytime soon. 

78. That apart, the appellant has already been admitted to bail in case 

F.I.R. No. 298/2019 dated 16.12.2019 vidé order dated 28.05.2020 

made by the learned Sessions Court; and in our view there also appears 

to be an overlap between the so-called larger conspiracy, acts and 

omissions alleged against the appellant in the said other FIR and in the 

subject FIR from which the present appeal arises. While the presence of 

the appellant for purposes of trial must be secured, there is no material 

or basis to suspect; nor is there any reasonable apprehension that the 

appellant will tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses. As very 

pithily put by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in P. Chidambaram (supra) 

the gravity of the offence alleged would beget the length of sentence, as 

may be awarded upon conclusion of trial; but an assertion as to the 

gravity of the offence cannot thwart the grant of bail. On the other 

hand, apart from militating against the presumption of innocence, pre-

trial detention would lead to needless psychological and physical 

deprivations; and above all, would seriously hamper the appellant from 

participating in and contributing to the preparation of his defence at the 

trial. The three cardinal concerns against grant of bail pending trial, 

namely of evidence tampering, witness intimidation and abscondence, 

can be addressed by imposition of requisite conditions on grant of bail. 

79. In view of the above considerations and discussion, we are inclined to 

allow the appeal. 

80. We accordingly set-aside impugned order dated 26.10.2020 made by 

the learned Special Court in the case arising from F.I.R. No. 59/2020 

CRL.A. 39/2021 
Page ! of ! 
98 133 


dated 06.03.2020 registered at P.S.: Crime Branch; and admit the 

appellant to regular bail until conclusion of trial, subject to the 

following conditions: 

(a) 
The appellant shall furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 

50,000/-(Rs. Fifty Thousand Only) with 02 local sureties in 

the like amount, to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Court; 

(b) 
The appellant shall furnish to the Investigating Officer/ 

S.H.O. a cellphone number on which the appellant may be 

contacted at any time and shall ensure that the number is kept 

active and switched-on at all times; 

(c) 
The appellant shall ordinarily reside at his place of residence 

as per prison records and shall inform the Investigating 

Officer if he changes his usual place of residence; 

(d) 
If the appellant has a passport, he shall surrender the same to 

the learned Trial Court and shall not travel out of the country 

without prior permission of the learned Trial Court; 

(e) 
The appellant shall not contact, nor visit, nor offer any 

inducement, threat or promise to any of the prosecution 

witnesses or other persons acquainted with the facts of case. 

The appellant shall not tamper with evidence nor otherwise 

indulge in any act or omission that is unlawful or that would 

prejudice the proceedings in the pending trial. 

81. For clarity, this judgment supersedes the interim custody bail granted to 

the appellant vidé order dated 04.06.2021.

82. Nothing in this order shall be construed as an expression on the merits

not guilty of 
committing such 
offence: 
Provided that after the 
expiry of a period of 
one year from the date 
of detention of the 
accused for an offence

section (6) of this 
section shall apply.

anything contained in 
the Code, no person 
accused of an offence 
punishable under 
Chapters IV and VI 
of this Act shall, if in 
custody, be released 
on bail or on his own 
bond unless the Public 
Prosecutor has been 
given an opportunity of 
being heard on the 
application for such 
release: 
Provided that such 
accused person shall 
not be released on bail 
or on his own bond if 
the Court, on a perusal 
of the case diary or the 
report made under 
Section 173 of the 
Code is of the opinion 
that there are 
reasonable grounds 
for believing that the 
accusation against 
such person is prima 
facie true.
