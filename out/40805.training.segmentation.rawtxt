By order dated 11 th October, 2019 in OMP (I) (Comm) 

336/2019, OMP (I) (Comm) 337/2019 and order dated 14 th October, 

2019 in OMP (I) (Comm) 343/2019, a learned Single Judge of this 

Court referred the disputes, arising between the appellant and the 

respondent, to arbitration by an eminent retired Chief Justice of the 

High Court of Jammu and Kashmir. The appellant is the claimant in 

the said arbitral proceedings, and the respondent before me is also the 

respondent therein. These appeals, under Section 37(2)(a) of the 

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ("the 1996 Act") impugn the 

order, dated 5 th March, 2021, passed by the learned Arbitrator on 

applications, preferred before him by the respondent under Section 16 

of the 1996 Act.

Factual Conspectus 

2. 
The offer of the appellant, in response to the notice, dated 24 th 

March, 2019, of the respondent, inviting tenders for certain civil 

works, was accepted by the respondent vide Letter of Acceptance 

dated 11 th May, 2017. As required by the conditions stipulated in the 

notice inviting tender and the Letter of Acceptance, Performance 

Bank Guarantees No 17793BG00038, 17793BG00040 and 

17793BG00041, dated 17 th July, 2017, 31 st August, 2017 and 31 st 

August, 2017 respectively (collectively referred to, hereinafter, as "the 

BGs") and extended subsequently, were furnished by the appellant. 

Formal contracts, between the appellant and the respondent were 

executed on 26 th September, 2017. Clauses 8.4, 50 and 50.2 of the 

General Conditions of Contract (GCC) are relevant, and the relevant 

parts thereof may be reproduced thus: 

"8.4 Release of Performance Security:

Contractor, subject to the issue of Completion 
Certificate by the Engineer in accordance with clause 
65 of these conditions. This shall not relieve the

good any failures, defects, imperfections, shrinkages, 
or faults that may be detected during the defect 
liability period specified in the Contract. 

(b) 
Wherever the contract is rescind(sic), the

(c) 
The Engineer shall not make a claim under the 
Performance Guarantee (PG) except for amounts to 
which Ircon International Limited is entitled under the 
contract (not withstanding and/or without prejudice to 
any other provisions in the contract agreement) in the

1. 
Failure by the contractor to extend the 
validity of the PG as described herein above, in 
which event the Engineer may claim the full 
amount of the PG. 

2. 
Failure by the contractor to pay Ircon 
International Limited any amount due, either as

rescinded under the provision of the GCC the 
PG shall be forfeited in full and shall be

of the works within the stipulated or extended 
period of completion, or is unlikely to complete 
the whole work or part thereof within time 
because of poor record of progress; or 

***** 

In any such case the Engineer on behalf of the 
Employer may serve the Contractor with a notice in 
writing to the effect and if the Contractor does not, 
within 7 days after delivery to him of such notice, 
proceed to make good his default in so far as the same 
is capable of being made good, and carry on the work 
or comply with such instructions as aforesaid to the 
entire satisfaction of the Engineer, the Employer shall 
be entitled after giving 48 hours notice in writing to 
terminate the contract, as a whole in terms of sub-
clause no. 8.4(b) and 8.4(c). 

ii. 
In such a case of termination, the 
Employer/Engineer may adopt the following courses 

a) 
Take possession of the site and any 
materials, construction plants, equipment, 
stores, etc. 

b) 
Measure up the balance work from 
which the Contractor has been removed, and get 
it completed by another Contractor. 
The 
manner and method, in which such work is to 
be completed, shall be entirely at the discretion 
of the Engineer whose decision shall be final 
and binding. 

c) 
Carry out the balance work from which 
the Contractor has been removed, by the 
employment of the required labour, materials,

In cases described in sub-clause 50.1(ii) above, the 
Employer/Engineer shall be entitled to forfeit the 
security deposit and encash the Performance Security 
amount as a whole in terms of sub-clause no. 8.4." 

(Emphasis supplied throughout) 

3. 
In respect of packages SS3-A, SS3-B and SS2-C, of the work 

allotted to the appellant under the aforesaid contracts, the respondent 

issued, in the first instance, 7-day notices of default and, in the 

second, 48 hour notices of default, after which the contract was 

terminated. The dates of the 7-day notices, 48 hour notices and 

notices of termination, in respect of these three packages, may be 

depicted, in a tabular form, thus:

For ease of reference, I would allude to the communications in Arb A 

(Comm) 16/2021 -essentially because arguments were addressed 

with reference to the record of that appeal. 

4. 
The controversy, from which the present litigations emanate, 

owes its origin, in Arb A (Comm) 16/2021, to the aforementioned two 

communications, from the respondent to the appellant, dated 13 th 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 7 of 48 

September, 2019 and 30 th September, 2019, both purportedly issued 

under Clause 50.1 of the GCC. The letter dated 13 th September, 2019 

alleged that several critical components of the work allotted to the 

appellant were still outstanding, and, therefore, granted 7 days' notice 

to the appellant to complete the outstanding work. Inter alia, the 

letter stated thus: 

"As you have: 

(i) 
Persistently disregarded instructions of IRCON 
and contravened provisions of the contract, 

(ii) 
Continuously failed to adhere to the agreed 
programme of work completion plan and 

(iii) Abandoned the contract by the de-mobilising all 
manpower from the site without intimating IRCON, 

In terms of clause 50.1 of General Conditions of Contract, 
you are hereby issued with a notice to proceed to make good 
your default and comply with the instructions to the entire 
satisfaction of IRCON within 7 days from the date of issue of 
this letter. 

***** 

You shall note that if we are not observing sufficient progress 
in making your defaults good during the notice period, further 
contractual action as per clause 50 of GCC shall be initiated." 

5. 
The appellant replied, to the aforesaid notice dated 13 th 

September, 2019, on 21 st September, 2019. The reply did not find 

favour with the respondent which issued, on 30 th September, 2019, the 

second, 48-hours' notice under Clause 50.1 of the GCC. After setting 

out the fact that the appellant had, earlier, been given a 7-day notice, 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 8 of 48 

requiring the appellant to comply with the stipulations mentioned 

therein, the notice dated 30 th September, 2019 went on to allege that 

"no significant improvement has been noticed within the said period" 

and that, "in spite of (the respondent's) repeated requests, (the 

appellant's) response remained lukewarm". The notice concluded 

thus: 

"The above inaction, persistent disregard to IRCON's 
instructions and overall poor progress of works at site are 
considered tantamount to violation of the contract conditions. 

Due to your persistent failure, you are hereby issued '48 
hours' notice under clause 50 of GCC. You are advised 
immediately to comply the points raised in Seven days' notice 
with submission of revised program commensurate with 
augmented resources and mobilise all necessary resources to 
ensure compliance during this notice period under intimation 
in writing to this office. 

In case of failing in above actions during the notice period, 
IRCON will be constrained to initiate action for termination 
of contract as per clause 50 of GCC." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

6. 
The issuance of the aforesaid 48-hour notices by the 

respondent, threatening initiation of action for termination of the 

contract, provoked the appellant to move this Court by way of OMP 

(I) (Comm) 336/2019, OMP (I) (Comm) 337/2019 and OMP (I) 

(Comm) 343/2019, under Section 9 of the 1996 Act. The only prayer, 

in each of these OMPs, was for stay against execution/encashment of 

the aforesaid three Bank Guarantees furnished by the appellant to the 

respondent. The averments in the OMPs asserted that there was no 

default, on the part of the appellant, in complying with the conditions 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 9 of 48 

in the contract and that, therefore, the allegations in the notices dated 

13 th September, 2019 and 30 th September, 2019, were incorrect. 

7. 
During the pendency of the OMPs, the Bank Guarantees 

provided by the appellant were encashed by the bank, on the request 

of the respondent, and Demand Drafts, covering the amounts 

guaranteed, were provided to the respondent. 

8. 
OMP (I) (Comm) 336/2019 and OMP (I) (Comm) 337/2019 

were disposed of, by a coordinate Single Bench of this Court, vide 

order dated 11 th October, 2019. As this order is pivotal to resolution of 

the controversy before me, it is necessary to extract, in full, paras 3 to 

8 thereof, thus: 

"3. 
These are petitions under Section 9 of the Arbitration 
and Conciliation Act, 1996 ('Act') seeking a stay against 
encashment of Bank Guarantees issued by Karnataka Bank 
Limited, Vadodara Branch. 

4. 
OMP (I) (Comm) 336/2019 relates to Bank Guarantee 
No. 
17793BG00038 dated 17.07.2017, extended on 
14.12.2018 and further extended on 26.06.2019, furnished by 
the petitioner to the respondent and OMP (I) (Comm) 
337/2019 relates to Bank Guarantee No. 17793BG00041 
dated 31.8.2017 extended on 27.11.2018. 

5. 
The parties had entered into a contract dated 
26.09.2017. Disputes have arisen between the parties with 
respect to the said contract. The respondent had given a 
seven days' notice dated 13.09.2019 to the petitioner under 
clause 50.1 of the GCC requiring him to secure the alleged 
defaults. On 30.09.2019, 48 hours' notice was given asking 
the petitioner to complete the work in accordance with the 
contract failing which the respondent was to initiate action 
towards termination of the contract. 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 10 of 48 

6. 
After some hearing, the parties have agreed to appoint 
a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate upon the disputes arising 
between the parties. Settlement has also been arrived at with 
respect to the invocation/encashment of the Bank Guarantees 
in question till the Arbitrator considers the application under 
Section 17 of the Act. 

7. 
With the consent of the parties, the petitions are being 
disposed of as follows: 

(i) 
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Badar Durrez Ahmad, 
former Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir High Court 
(Retired) is appointed as Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate 
the disputes between the parties. 

(ii) 
The learned Arbitrator will give disclosure 
under Section 12 of the Act. 

(iii) The fee of the Sole Arbitrator will be as per the 
Fourth Schedule of the Act. 

(iv) Bank Guarantees issued by Karnataka Bank 
Limited Branch, Vadodra bearing no. 17793BG00038 
dated 17.07.2017 and 17793BG00041 dated 
31.8.2017, have been encashed and the Demand Drafts 
are stated to be in possession of the respondent. The 
said Demand Drafts will not be encashed and will be 
deposited with the office of the Learned Arbitrator. 

(v) 
Within 15 days of commencement of the 
arbitration proceedings, the petitioner will move an 
application under Section 17 of the Act for appropriate 
interim order. Needless to say that the Arbitrator 
would be free to continue/modify/vacate the order 
passed by this Court today. 

8. 
The demand draft lying with the respondent will not be 
encashed until further orders by the Arbitral Tribunal."

Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 11 of 48 

9. 
On 14 th October, 2019, this Court also disposed of OMP (I) 

(Comm) 343/2019, by referring the dispute in the said case also to the 

same learned Arbitrator, i.e. Hon'ble Mr. Justice Badar Durrez 

Ahmad (retired). 

10. The contracts were rescinded, by the respondent, on 11 th 

October, 2019 and 22 nd October, 2019, as already stated in para 3 

supra. 

11. Joint proceedings are being conducted by the learned 

Arbitrator, in all these three matters. 

12. The appellant filed applications, before the learned Arbitrator, 

under Section 17 of the 1996 Act, as permitted by this Court in its 

orders dated 11 th October, 2019 and 14 th October, 2019 supra. These 

applications were disposed of, on 28 th November, 2019, by the learned 

Arbitrator, by consent, directing that the demand drafts be returned by 

the respondent to the appellant, in exchange for Bank Guarantees, for 

equivalent amounts, to be furnished by the appellant in favour of the 

respondent, which were to be kept alive during the arbitral 

proceedings, with a restraint on the respondent from encashing the 

Bank Guarantees. 

13. In the meanwhile, the appellant filed its Statements of Claims, 

in the three arbitral proceedings before the learned Arbitrator. For the 

purposes of the present appeal, I am not concerned with the 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 12 of 48 

contentions, on merits, contained in the Statement of Claim, or the 

grounds on which the appellant sought to deny the allegation, of the 

respondent, that it was in breach of the contract. I deem it 

appropriate, however, to reproduce paras 93 to 95 of the Statements of 

Claim, thus: 

"93. The Claimant submits that, the Respondent 
immediately after 48 hours notice without terminating the 
contract under the terms of the contract approached the 
Claimant's Branch Manager of Karnataka Bank, Vadodara 
Branch for the encashment of the above said performance 
guarantee on 04/10/2019. Thus, the contract in question has 
been put to an end by the Respondent is illegal and bad in 
law. 

94. 
The claimant submits that, Clause-8 of General 
Conditions of contract of which the relevant provisions of 
clause 8.4 (b) and (c) are reproduced as under: 

8.4 (b) where the contract is rescind, the security 
deposit shall be forfeited and the Performance Security 
shall (be encashed) and the balance work shall be got 
done independently without risk and cost of the failed 
contractor. The failed contractor shall be debarred 
from participating in the tender for executing the 
balance work. 

8.4 (c) The Engineer shall not make a claim under the 
Performance Guarantee (PG) except for amounts to 
which IRCON International Limited is entitled under 
the contract (notwithstanding and/or without prejudice 
to any other provisions in the contract agreement) in 
the event of :-

1. 
Failure by the contractor to extend the 
validity of the PG as described hereinabove, in 
which event the Engineer may claim the full 
amount of the PG. 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 13 of 48 

2. 
Failure by the contract to pay Ircon 
International Limited any amount due, either as 
agreed by the contractor or determined under 
any of the Clauses/Conditions of the agreement, 
within 30 days of the service of notice to this 
effect by Engineer. 

3. 
The contract being determined or 
rescinded under provision of the GCC the PG 
shall be forfeited in full and shall be absolutely 
at the disposal of the Engineer." 

95. 
The claimant submits that, Clause 8.4 (b) provides for 
encashment of the performance Security only after the 
contract is rescinded, whereas in the present case the 
Respondent initiated action for invocation/encashment of the 
Bank Guarantee prior to termination/rescission of the 
contract. The contract was terminated/rescinded by the 
Respondent vide letter No. IRCON/3018/DFCCIL-CTP-
12/SS3-SC/1086/1272 dtd. 11/10/2019." 

The invocation and encashment, by the respondent, of the Bank 

Guarantees furnished by the appellant was, therefore, assailed on the 

ground that the contractual provisions permitted such 

encashment/invocation only consequent on termination/rescission of 

the contract, and not prior thereto. This, as the discussion hereinafter 

would reveal, is an important circumstance. 
Thereafter, the 

Statements of Claim filed by the appellant also went on to assail the 

termination, by the respondent, of the contract, on various grounds. 

14. The respondent filed applications, before the learned Arbitrator, 

under Section 16 of the 1996 Act, essentially objecting to the 

inclusion, by the appellant, of the challenge to the termination, by the 

respondent, of the contract, in its Statements of Claim. The prayer 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 14 of 48 

clause in the applications, therefore, prayed that the learned Arbitral 

Tribunal "be pleased to hold that it has jurisdiction to only adjudicate 

the disputes pertaining to the invocation of the BG and does not have 

jurisdiction to adjudicate any other disputes or claims raised by the 

Claimant in the present proceedings". A supplementary application 

was also preferred, by the respondent, before the learned Arbitrator, 

under Section 16 of the 1996 Act, praying that the learned Arbitral 

Tribunal acknowledge that it did not have the jurisdiction to arbitrate 

on claims, issues and disputes within the ambit of 'excepted matters' 

under Clause 73 of the GCC. Clause 73.0 of the GCC read thus: 

"73.0 SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES 

All disputes and differences of any kind whatsoever 
arising out of or in connection with the contract, 
whether during the progress of the work or after its 
completion and whether before or after the 
determination of the contract, shall be settled as under, 
provided that matters for which provision has been 
made in clauses 20.3, 36.5, 40.1, 40.2, 49.7, 50.0, 51.0, 
59.0, 61.2 and 72.2 of General Conditions of Contract 
or in any clause of the Special Conditions of Contract 
shall be deemed as 'excepted matters' (matters not 
arbitrable) and decision of the Employer there are, 
shall be final and binding on the contractor; provided 
further that 'excepted matters' shall stand specifically 
excluded from the purview of this clause." 

15. The appellant filed replies before the learned Arbitrator, 

opposing the aforesaid applications under Section 16, preferred by the 

respondent. 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 15 of 48 

16. The applications of the respondent, under Section 16, were 

disposed of, by the learned Arbitrator, vide a common Order dated 5 th 

March, 2021, which forms the subject matter of challenge in these 

appeals. Essentially, the learned Arbitrator reasoned/held thus: 

(i) 
It was true that the prayer, in the OMPs filed under 

Section 9, by the appellant, was for stay of encashment of the 

Bank Guarantees provided by it. However, it was also true that 

the prayer was predicated on the circumstances leading to the 

issue of the 48 hour notices by the respondent and the 

impending termination of the contract. 

(ii) The use of the words "disputes have arisen between the 

parties with respect to the said contract", as contained in para 5 

of the order dated 11 th October, 2019 supra, passed by this 

Court in the OMPs obviously referred "to all the disputes which 

(had) been pointed out and brought to the notice of the court 

through the said section 9 petition", and could not "be limited 

to only the question of invocation of the PBG". In fact, the 

issuance of the 7 day and 48 hour notices by the respondent was 

because disputes had arisen between the appellant and the 

respondent, pertaining to the contract. The mere fact that 

limited interim measures had been sought by the appellant, in 

its Section 9 petitions, did not "circumscribe the arena of 

disputes between the parties". 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 16 of 48 

(iii) The words "after some hearing, the parties have agreed to 

appoint a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate upon the disputes arising 

between the parties" and "settlement has also been arrived at 

with respect to the invocation/encashment of the Bank 

Guarantees in question till the Arbitrator considers the 

application under Section 17 of the Act", as employed in para 6 

of the order of this Court, plainly read, indicated "that there 

(had) been agreement/settlement on two aspects: (1) to appoint 

a Sole arbitrator to adjudicate upon the disputes arising between 

the parties; and (2) with regard to the invocation/encashment of 

the PBG which (had) been further elaborated in para 7(iv), 7(v) 

and 8 of the said order". 

(iv) Para-7 (i) of the order clearly indicated that the "disputes 

between the parties" were to be adjudicated by the learned 

Arbitrator. 

(v) Evidently, therefore, "the disputes between the parties, 

not limited to the issue of invocation of the PBG were, by 

consent of the parties, referred to (the) Tribunal for 

adjudication". As such, "the contention of the Respondent that 

the consent for arbitration given by the parties before the 

Hon'ble High Court of Delhi was only limited to the issue of 

legality of invocation of the PBG (was) untenable and (was) not 

borne out of the said order passed by the Hon'ble High Court". 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 17 of 48 

(vi) At the same time it was also evident that only those 

disputes which existed at the time of the passing of the order 

dated 11 th October, 2019 by this Court were referred to the 

Arbitrator for adjudication. 

(vii) Consequently, disputes pertaining strictly to the 

termination, which happened subsequently, and claims arising 

solely out of the termination, were not, as they could not have 

been, referred to the learned Arbitrator for adjudication. 

(viii) The respondent contended, before the Arbitrator, that he 

had no jurisdiction to arbitrate on the disputes as the conditions 

to arbitration, as set out in Clause 73 of the GCC had not been 

complied with. Relying, for the purpose, on Section 4 of the 

1996 Act 1 in this context, the respondent sought to contend that, 

as consent to arbitration had been given, by it, before this 

Court, limited to the legality of invocation of the Bank 

Guarantee, the respondent had not waived its right to object to 

any other dispute, within the meaning of Section 4. This 

contention was not tenable, as the consent to arbitration was 

given, before this Court, not limited to the issue of invocation 

of the Bank Guarantees, "but covered all disputes which had 

reference in the claimant's petition under Section 9". As such, 

1 "4. 
Waiver of right to object. -
A party who knows that -
(a) 
any provision of this Part from which the parties may derogate, or 
(b) 
any requirement under the arbitration agreement, 
has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to 
such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for stating that objection, 
within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object." 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 18 of 48 

qua all such disputes, the respondents right to object to the 

jurisdiction of the learned Arbitrator, on the ground of non-

fulfilment of preconditions for arbitration as contained in the 

GCC, stood waived. 

(ix) Specifically on the contention of the respondent that 

disputes and claims arising out of the termination of the 

contract could not be subject matter of arbitration in the 

proceedings before the learned Arbitrator, following on the 

order dated 11 th October, 2019 of this Court, as they were not in 

existence when the order was passed, the learned Arbitrator 

held thus, in para 15 of the impugned order: 

"The fourth contention of the learned counsel for the 
respondent was that disputes and claims arising out of 
termination of the contract were not in existence when 
the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi passed its order dated 
11.10.2019 and as such they cannot be the subject 
matter of arbitration in the present proceedings. As 
already pointed out above, there is substance in this 
contention. However, a detailed examination of the 
claims raised by the Claimant would have to be 
undergone so as to separate those claims or part of 
those claims which arises solely out of the termination 
of the contract. The exercise, in my view, would have 
to be done at the final stage after evidence has been 
laid. The principle is clear that those claims which 
solely arise out of termination are not covered under 
the present reference by the Hon'ble High Court by 
virtue of its order dated 11.10.2019. The actual 
separation and severance of such claims can only be 
done at a later stage as mentioned above." 
(Emphasis supplied) 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 19 of 48 

(x) The contention, of the respondent, that "excepted 

matters" were outside the scope of arbitration, was 

unexceptionable, in view of Clause 73.0 of the GCC. This 

contention was accepted on principle, with the observation that 

the extent to which the claims of the appellant were "excepted 

matters", if at all, could be assessed only after detailed scrutiny, 

once evidence in the case was complete. A specific issue to this 

effect had been framed. 

17. The impugned order, therefore, ends with the following 

conclusions: 

"20.1 The contention of the respondent that the consent for 
arbitration given by the parties before the Hon'ble High Court 
of Delhi was only limited to the issue of legality of invocation 
of the PBG is untenable. At the same time, it is also evident 
that only those disputes which existed at the time of passing 
of the order dated 11.10.2019 by the Hon'ble High Court of 
Delhi were referred to this Tribunal for adjudication. 
Consequently, disputes pertaining strictly to the termination, 
which happened subsequently, and claims arising solely out 
of the termination, in my view, were not, as they could not 
have been, referred to this Tribunal for adjudication in the 
present proceedings. 

20.2 The principle is clear that those claims which solely 
arise out of termination are not covered under the present 
reference by the Hon'ble High Court by virtue of its order 
dated 11.10.2019. However, the actual separation and 
severance of such claims can only be done as a later stage as 
mentioned above. 

20.3 The waiver with regard to the pre-arbitration procedure 
specified in clause 73 of the GCC was not limited to the issue 
of invocation of the PBG but it also covered all the disputes 
which were opened before the Hon'ble High Court. 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 20 of 48 

20.4 The reference to arbitration was by consent of the 
parties. This is specifically recorded in the said order dated 
11.10.2019 passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi. 
Therefore, the Respondent cannot contend that the pre-
arbitration conditions spelt out in clause 73 of the GCC ought 
to have been complied with in respect of the disputes which 
were placed before the Hon'ble High Court. 

20.5 It is correct that excepted matters are not arbitrable. 
The principle for deciding which matters can be regarded as 
"excepted matters" has also been explained above. However, 
to what extent the claims raised by the Claimant fall within 
the "excepted matters", if at all, could not be decided without 
a detailed scrutiny which would be possible only after 
considering all the documents and evidence on record. This 
enquiry has to be postponed till the stage and will be decided 
under issue no. 2. 

20.6 The section 16 application as also the supplementary 
application under section 16 filed by the Respondent are 
disposed of in the aforesaid terms. This order shall govern 
not only these applications but also the parallel and virtually 
identical application in the matters arising out of OMP Nos. 
337/2019 and 343/2019." 

18. The appellant is essentially aggrieved by the finding, reflected 

in paras 20.1 and 20.2 of the impugned order, that disputes pertaining 

strictly to termination of the contract between the appellant and 

respondent, and claims arising solely out of such termination, were 

not amenable to adjudication in the arbitral proceedings before the 

learned Arbitrator. Additionally, Ms Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior 

Counsel for the appellant also assails the finding, in para 18 of the 

impugned Order, that claims prohibited by any clause in the SCC 

would, ipso facto, stand excluded from the ambit of the arbitration, as 

they would be "excepted matters". This finding, she submits, is in the 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 21 of 48 

teeth of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in B.S.N.L. v 

Motorola India Pvt Ltd 2 . 

Submissions of the appellant 

19. I have heard Ms Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Counsel for 

the appellant at length. 

20. Ms Arora assailed the decision of the learned Arbitrator to 

exclude, from the scope of the arbitral proceedings, the termination of 

the contract between the appellant and the respondent and all claims 

solely arising from such termination. She contended that a holistic 

reading of the order, dated 11 th October, 2019, of this Court, revealed 

that all "disputes", between the appellant and the respondent stood 

referred to arbitration, by consent of the parties. The fact that the 

respondent had issued, to the appellant, notices, proposing to 

terminate the contract, was also noticed in the said order. The order, 

therefore, encompassed, within the scope of the "disputes" referred to 

arbitration, the termination proposed by the 7-day and, thereafter, the 

48-hour notices issued by the respondent to the appellant, even if no 

formal order of termination had been passed by then. Ms Arora 

pointed out that, having acted on the basis of the decision to terminate 

the appellant's contract by invoking the Bank Guarantees furnished by 

the appellant, issuance of a separate order of termination was a mere 

formality, and the respondent could not justifiably seek to exclude, 

2 (2009) 2 SCC 337 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 22 of 48 

from the ambit of the arbitral proceedings, the legality of the 

termination of the appellant's contract. She also contended that, in 

fact, the act of invocation of the Bank Guarantees, by the respondent, 

ipso facto resulted in termination of the contract between the appellant 

and the respondent. For this purpose, she sought to read, in 

conjunction, Clauses 50 and Clause 8.4(c)(3) of the GCC. These 

clauses, pointed out Ms Arora, permitted invocation of the Bank 

Guarantee only in the event of rescinding or termination of the 

contract between the appellant and the respondent. By invoking the 

Bank Guarantees, therefore, she submits, the respondent had exercised 

its authority under Clause 8.4(c)(3), which was available only in the 

event of termination. To that extent, submits Ms Arora, the contracts 

stood terminated by the invocation of the Bank Guarantees. At any 

rate, she submits, the letter dated 30 th September, 2019 concluded 

with the recital that the respondent would "be constrained to initiate 

action for termination of contract as per Clause 50 of GCC". Issuance 

of a formal termination order was, therefore, she submits, a mere 

formality, which was inevitable in the circumstances. She invited my 

attention to the specific ground, urged before the learned Arbitrator 

and recorded in para 7 of the impugned Order, to the effect that "the 

PBG could only be invoked post termination and since it had been 

invoked there was deemed termination prior to the passing of the 

order dated 11.10.2019 and therefore all disputes including the issue 

of termination was within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal". 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 23 of 48 

21. I posed, to Ms Arora, a hypothetical query. If, I suggested, no 

formal order of termination would have been issued by the 

respondent, after invoking the Bank Guarantees, would that not have 

constituted an independent ground for the appellant's to challenge the 

invocation as being violative of Clause 50 read with Clause 8.4(c)(3) 

of the GCC, which contemplated invocation, or forfeiture, of the 

security furnished by the appellant in the form of the Bank Guarantees 

only consequent upon determination/rescinding of the contract? Ms 

Arora, even while acknowledging that, in such a circumstance, the 

invocation of the Bank Guarantees could be assailed on the said 

ground, submits that the issue for consideration was different, viz. the 

scope and nature of the disputes which were referred, by this Court, to 

arbitration on 11 th October, 2019. 

22. Ms Arora also relied on sub-sections (2A), (3) and (4) of 

Section 23 3 of the 1996 Act. She submits that the very intent of 

inserting, in Section 23, sub-sections (2A) and (4) [the former by 

Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 

2016 and the latter by Section 5 of the Arbitration and Conciliation 

(Amendment) Act, 2019] was to avoid multiplicity of litigation. 

3 "23. 
Statement of claim and defence. -
***** 
(2A) 
The respondent, in support of his case, may also submit a counter claim or plead a set off, 
which shall be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal, if such counter claim or set off falls within 
the scope of the arbitration agreement. 
(3) 
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, either party may amend or supplement his claim 
or defence during the course of the arbitral proceedings, unless the arbitral Tribunal considers it 
inappropriate to allow the amendment or supplement having regard to the delay in making it. 
(4) 
The statement of claim and defence under the section shall be completed within a period 
of six months from the date the arbitrator or all the arbitrators, as the case may be, received notice, 
in writing, of the appointment." 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 24 of 48 

Section 23(3) permitted rejection, of the prayer to amend the 

statement of claim, only on the ground of delay. Ms Arora also 

referred me to Section 2(9) 4 . 

23. Ms. Arora further emphasised the comprehensive wording of 

the arbitration agreement between the appellant and the respondent, 

which covered "all disputes and differences of any kind whatsoever 

arising out of or in connection with the contract, whether during the 

progress of the work or after its completion and whether before or 

after the determination of the contract". The termination of the 

contract was also, therefore, she submitted, a dispute referable to 

arbitration. Ms Arora exhorts this Court to interpret the order, dated 

11 th October, 2019, referring the parties to arbitration, as 

encompassing the legality of the termination of the contract, which 

was a foregone conclusion, as well. She points out that this Court did 

not limit or circumscribe the issues, or disputes, while referring the 

parties to arbitration. 

24. Ms Arora further submits that, if the legality of the termination, 

by the respondent, of the contract with the appellant, was not to be 

decided in the present arbitral proceedings, it would result in an 

incongruous situation, for various reasons. She submits that many of 

the claims of the appellant were predicated on the legality of the 

termination, and the appellant would stand foreclosed from having all 

4 "2. 
Definitions. -
***** 
(9) 
Where this Part, other than clause (a) of section 25 or clause (a) of sub-section (2) of 
section 32, refers to a claim, it shall also apply to a counter-claim, and where it refers to a defence, 
it shall also apply to a defence to that counter-claim." 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 25 of 48 

such claims arbitrated. Similarly, she submits, a piquant situation 

would arise, in which the legality of the invocation of the Bank 

Guarantees would be decided by one arbitral tribunal, and the legality 

of the termination, which is a contractual precondition for invoking 

the Bank Guarantees, would be decided by another. This would result 

in overlap of issues and multiplicity of proceedings which is required, 

at all costs, to be avoided. Ms Arora presses into service the 

judgement of the Supreme Court in State of Goa v. Praveen 

Enterprises 5 , which was also cited before the learned Arbitrator. 

25. Ms Arora also invoked Section 4 of the 1996 Act, to contend 

that, having failed to question the jurisdiction of the learned Arbitrator 

to entertain the challenge, of the appellant in its Statement of Claim, 

to the legality of the termination of the contract, the respondent was 

statutorily estopped from challenging said jurisdiction at a later stage. 

She points out that the first traversal, to the jurisdiction of the learned 

Arbitrator to entertain the challenge, of the appellant, to the 

termination of the agreement, was in the application under Section 16, 

filed as late as on 6 th May, 2020. This, she submits, indicates that the 

plea was by way of an afterthought, squarely barred by Section 4. She 

points out that this contention was specifically raised before the 

learned Arbitrator. Reliance has been placed, in this context, on para 

39 of the judgement of the Supreme Court in B.S.N.L. 2 . Ms Arora has 

also placed reliance on the judgement of a coordinate bench of this 

Court in A.K.M. Enterprises Pvt Ltd v. Ahluwalia Contract (India) 

5 (2012) 12 SCC 581 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 26 of 48 

Ltd 6 and invited my specific attention to para 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12 and 13 

of the said decision. 

26. Insofar as the findings of the learned Arbitrator regarding the 

"excepted matters" were concerned, Ms Arora is aggrieved by the 

finding that, where the claim is prohibited by any clause of the SCC, it 

would ipso facto fall within the definition of "excepted matters". 

This, she submits, is contrary to the law laid down in B.S.N.L. 2 Ms 

Arora submits, however, that she would be satisfied if this finding, of 

the learned Arbitrator, is treated as prima facie in nature, reserving 

liberty to the appellant to establish, before the learned Arbitrator that, 

despite the said finding, any particular claim was amenable to 

arbitration. 

27. Finally, Ms Arora emphasises the distinction between appeals 

under Section 37(2), vis-à-vis challenges under Section 34 to final 

awards. She submits that the constraints on the Court, while 

exercising jurisdiction under Section 34, would not necessarily apply 

under Section 37. Impliedly, therefore, Ms Arora seeks to contend 

that the jurisdiction of the Court under Section 37 is wider than that 

under Section 34. However, she has not drawn my attention to any 

judicial authority, supporting the submission. 

Analysis 

28. Scope of Section 37(2) 7 

6 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7614 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 27 of 48 

28.1 I may first address the last submission of Ms Arora that the 

jurisdiction of the Court under Section 37(2)(a) is wider than that 

under Section 34. 

28.2 Unquestionably, Section 37 purports to confer appellate power. 

Sub-section (1) thereof provides for appeals against orders passed by 

the Court under Section 34; in other words, it is in the nature of a 

second rung of challenge. As against this, Section 37(2) is in the 

nature of a first appeal, and is provided against orders passed by the 

arbitral tribunal under Section 16(2) or 16(3), or under Section 17. 

28.3 It is obvious that the legislature does not contemplate any 

difference in the extent of jurisdiction of the Court exercising 

appellate power under the two clauses of Section 37(2). In other 

words, the extent of appellate jurisdiction under Section 37(2)(a) and 

Section 37(2)(b) has to be regarded as equal, there being no statutory 

indication to the contrary. 

28.4 Whether under clause (a) or (b), the order of the Arbitral 

Tribunal, which is amenable to challenge before the Court, is 

indisputably interlocutory in nature. Indeed, if the order is not 

interlocutory, and finally decides any issue, the present appeal would

not be maintainable under Section 37(2), and the appellant would 

necessarily had to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court under Section 

34, in view of the position of law enunciated in Indian Farmers 

Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd v. Bhadra Products 8 . 

28.5 If the submission of Ms Arora were to be accepted, it would 

imply that the jurisdiction of the Court to interfere, against an 

interlocutory order of the Arbitrator, would be more expansive than 

the jurisdiction available against the final award. To my mind, such 

an interpretation, of Section 37(2), would be incongruous and 

anomalous in equal measure. The scope of interference against 

interlocutory orders, classically, is far more circumscribed than the 

scope of interference against the final decision of the authority below. 

Section 37(2) cannot, in my view, be so read -in the absence of any 

statutory indication to that effect -as to turn this principle on its head. 

28.6 Besides, Section 37 falls, like Section 34, in Part I of the 1996 

Act and is, therefore, subject to the discipline of Section 5, which 

proscribes judicial intervention, in matters covered by Part I, except 

where also provided. The Supreme Court clearly held, in Bharat 

Sewa Sansthan v. Uttar Pradesh Electronics Corporation Ltd 9 , that 

"main objective of the Act is to make provision for an arbitral 

procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of 

the specific arbitration and to minimise the supervisory role of courts 

in the arbitral process and to permit an arbitral Tribunal to use

9 AIR 2007 SC 2961 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 29 of 48 

mediation, conciliation or other procedures during the arbitral 

proceedings in settlement of disputes, etc.". Minimising of the 

supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process is, therefore, one of 

the sanctified aspirations of the Legislature, while enacting the 1996 

Act. 

28.7 In my considered opinion, this objective has to drive the 

approach of the Court, while exercising jurisdiction under any of the 

provisions contained in Part I of the 1996 Act. It must be borne in 

mind that the 1996 Act is an Act to foster and provide impetus to the 

arbitral process, and the sanctity thereof, and not an Act to clothe civil 

courts with jurisdiction. Exercise of jurisdiction by civil courts, under 

the 1996 Act has, therefore, necessarily to be extremely circumspect, 

keeping this guiding principle in mind. 

28.8 This Court has, in its recent decision in Dinesh Gupta v Anand 

Gupta 10 , held, on this aspect, as under (albeit in the context of 

Section 37(2)(b)): 

"40. Oftentimes, the question arises as to whether the 
jurisdiction of the High Court, under Section 37, is subject to 
the same circumscriptions as formed by its jurisdiction under 
Section 34. Mr. Nayar had submitted, before me, that it would 
be folly to restrict the jurisdiction of the High Court, under 
Section 37, by the principles which apply to Section 34. He 
had sought to emphasise that the jurisdiction vested in the 
Court by Section 37 was appellate, unlike Section 34. 
Appellate jurisdiction, by its very nature, Mr. Nayar had 
sought to submit, is wider than the jurisdiction which applies 
to consideration of objections against an arbitral award. 
Appellate jurisdiction encompasses, within its fold, the power 

10 MANU/DE/1727/2020 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 30 of 48 

to review findings of fact and, in fact, the appellate court is, 
jurisprudentially, an extension of the original court, the 
appeal being a continuation of the original proceedings. As 
such, Mr. Nayar had sought to submit, the High Court, 
exercising appellate jurisdiction under Section 37, should not 
feel restricted by the constraints which govern its jurisdiction 
under Section 34. 

41. 
Empirically viewed, Mr. Nayar's submissions appear 
attractive. There is, undoubtedly, qualitatively, a distinction 
between appellate jurisdiction and "judicial review 
jurisdiction". Appellate jurisdiction, equally, is classically 
regarded as an extension of original jurisdiction, the appellate 
proceedings being an extension of the original proceedings. 
The appellate court is, therefore, ordinarily, empowered to re-
appreciate findings of fact entered by the original court. That 
the jurisdiction of the appellate court is much wider than the 
jurisdiction of a Court exercising judicial review, of any other 
kind, is also, classically, well settled. 

42. 
Legal principles are, however, in every instance, 
required to be applied to the factual scenario, in which their 
application is invited. While, therefore, appreciating the 
jurisdiction of the High Court, under Section 37 of the 1996 
Act, we are required to be aware of the fact that the order, 
interference with which is being invited, was passed by an 
arbitrator, or arbitral tribunal. The sanctity attached to arbitral 
awards, especially in the context of the 1996 Act-which is 
based on the UNCITRAL model-has, therefore, necessarily to 
be borne in mind, while exercising jurisdiction over the 
decision of the arbitrator, whether in the form of a final 
award, or an interim award under Section 17. 

43. 
In the opinion of this Court, another important, and 
peculiar, feature of the 1996 Act, which must necessarily 
inform the approach of the High Court, is that the 1996 Act 
provides for an appeal against interlocutory orders, whereas 
the final award is not amenable to any appeal, but only to 
objections under Section 34. If the submission of Mr. Nayar, 
as advanced, were to be accepted, it would imply that the 
jurisdiction of the Court, over the interlocutory decision of 
the arbitrator, would be much wider than the jurisdiction 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 31 of 48 

against the final award. Though, jurisprudentially, perhaps, 
such a position may not be objectionable, it does appear 
incongruous, and opposed to the well settled principle that the 
scope of interference with interim orders, is, ordinarily, much 
more restricted than the scope of interference with the final 
judgment. 

44. 
Here, yet another peculiar dispensation, in the 1996 
Act, apropos the scope of interference with the decision of the 
arbitrator, manifests itself. The proviso to Section 36 (3) 
ordains that the Court, while considering an application for 
grant of stay of a final arbitral award for payment of money, 
shall "have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a 
decree under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908". By reference, therefore, Order 41 Rule 5 of the CPC, 
which deals with stay, by the appellate court, of original 
decrees, stands incorporated into Section 36(3) of the 1996 
Act. Though, therefore, the final arbitral award is not made 
amenable to appeal, by the 1996 Act, any prayer for stay of 
the arbitral award, that accompanies objections under Section 
34, is required to be examined in the light of the provisions, 
in the CPC, governing stay of original decrees, in exercise of 
appellate jurisdiction. Though, for the purposes of this 
judgment, it is not necessary to psychoanalyse the legislative 
intent in providing for such a peculiar dispensation, the fact 
that applications for stay of final arbitral awards, are required 
to be considered on the basis of the principles governing stay, 
by appellate courts, under Order 41 Rule 5 of the CPC, 
indicate, to an extent, that the principles of Order 41 are also 
required to be borne in mind, while exercising appellate 
jurisdiction, under Section 37. 

45. 
The 1996 Act is, preambularly, a fallout of the United 
Nation's Commission on International Trade Law 
(UNCITRAL), adopted in 1995 as the Model Law on 
International Commercial Arbitration. The Statement of 
Objects and Reasons, preceding the 1996 Act, stipulates, in 
paras 2 to 5 thereof, as under, in this respect: 

"2. 
The United Nations Commission on 
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) adopted in 
1985 the Model Law on International Commercial 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 32 of 48 

Arbitration. The General Assembly of the United 
Nations has recommended that all countries give due 
consideration to the said Model Law, in view of the 
desirability of uniformity of the law of arbitral 
procedures and the specific needs of international 
commercial arbitration practise. The UNCITRAL also 
adopted in 1980 a set of Conciliation Rules. The 
General Assembly of the United Nations has 
recommended the use of these Rules in cases where 
the disputes arise in the context of international 
commercial relations and the parties seek amicable 
settlement of the disputes by recourse to conciliation. 
An important feature of the UNCITRAL Model Law 
and Rules is that they have harmonized concepts on 
arbitration and conciliation of different legal systems 
of the world and thus contains provisions which are 
designed for universal applications. 

3. 
Though the said UNCITRAL Model Law and 
Rules are intended to deal with International 
Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation, they could, 
with appropriate modifications, serve as a model for 
legislation on domestic arbitration and conciliation. 
The present Bill seeks to consolidate and amend the 
law relating to domestic arbitration, international 
commercial arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral 
awards and to define the law relating to conciliation, 
taking into account the said UNCITRAL Model Law 
and Rules. 

4. 
The main objectives of the Bill are as under:-

a. 
to comprehensively cover international 
and commercial arbitration and conciliation as 
also domestic arbitration and conciliation; 

b. 
to make provision for an arbitral 
procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of 
meeting the needs of the specific arbitration; 

c. 
to provide that the arbitral tribunal gives 
reasons for its arbitral award; 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 33 of 48 

d. 
to ensure that the arbitral tribunal 
remains within the limits of its jurisdiction; 

e. 
to minimize the supervisory role of the 
courts in the arbitral process; 

f. 
to permit an arbitral tribunal to use 
mediation, conciliation or other procedure 
during the arbitral proceedings to encourage 
settlement of disputes; 

g. 
to provide that every final arbitral award 
is enforced in the same manner as if it were a 
decree of the court; 

h. 
to provide a settlement agreement 
reached by the parties as a result of conciliation 
proceedings will have the same status and effect 
as an arbitral award on agreed terms on the 
substance of the dispute rendered by an arbitral 
tribunal; and 

i. 
to provide that, for purposes of 
enforcement of foreign awards, every arbitral 
award made in a country to which one of the 
two international Conventions relating to 
foreign arbitral awards to which India is a party 
applies, will be treated as a foreign awards. 

5. 
The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects." 

46. 
The Supreme Court has, in Chloro Controls (I) Ltd. v. 
Severn Trent Water Purification Inc. 11 , held that the 
legislative intent and essence of the 1996 Act "is to bring 
domestic as well as international commercial arbitration in 
consonance with the UNCITRAL Model Rules, the New 
York Convention and Geneva Convention". The afore-
extracted passages, from the Statements of Object and 
Reasons of the 1996 Act has, necessarily, to guide the Court, 
while interpreting the provisions thereof. While on the point, 

11 (2013) 1 SCC 641 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 34 of 48 

it may be noted that, in Bharat Sewa Sansthan v. U.P. 
Electronics Corporation Ltd. 9 , the Supreme Court has clearly 
held the "main objective of the (1996) Act" as being "to make 
provision for an arbitral procedure which is fair, efficient and 
capable of meeting the needs of the specific arbitration and to 
minimise the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process 
and to permit an arbitral Tribunal to use mediation, the 
conciliation or other procedures during the arbitral 
proceedings in settlement of disputes, etc." 

47. 
There can be no gainsaying the proposition, therefore, 
that, while exercising any kind of jurisdiction, over arbitral 
orders, or arbitral awards, whether interim or final, or with 
the arbitral process itself, the Court is required to maintain 
an extremely circumspect approach. It is always required to 
be borne, in mind, that arbitration is intended to be an avenue 
for "alternative dispute resolution", and not a means to 
multiply, or foster, further disputes. Where, therefore, the 
arbitrator resolves the dispute, that resolution is entitled to 
due respect and, save and except for the reasons explicitly set 
out in the body of the 1996 Act, is, ordinarily, immune from 
judicial interference. 

48. 
Interestingly, while examining, in Snehadeep 
Structures (P) Ltd. v. Maharashtra Small Scale Industries 
Development Corporation Ltd. 12 , the scope of the expression 
"appeal" as employed in Section 7 of the Interest on Delayed 
Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Undertakings Act, 
1993, the Supreme Court held that, "if the meaning of 
"appeal" is ambiguous, the interpretation that advances the 
object and purpose of the legislation, shall be accepted." 
Purposive interpretation, as has been noticed in Shailesh 
Dhairyawan v. Mohan Balkrishna Lulla 13 and Richa 
Mishra v. State of Chhattisgarh 14 , has, over time, replaced 
the principle of "plain reading" as the golden rule, for 
interpreting statutory instruments. 

49. 
In my opinion, this principle has to guide, strongly, the 
approach of this Court, while dealing with a challenge such as 

12 (2010) 3 SCC 34 
13 (2016) 3 SCC 619 
14 (2016) 4 SCC 1799 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 35 of 48 

the present, which is directed against an order which, at an 
interlocutory stage, merely directing furnishing of security, by 
one of the parties to the dispute. The power, of the learned 
Sole Arbitrator, to direct furnishing of security, is not under 
question; indeed, in view of sub-clause (b) of Section 17 (1) 
(ii) of the 1996 Act, it cannot. The arbitrator is, under the said 
sub-clause, entirely within his jurisdiction in securing the 
amount in dispute in the arbitration. Whether, in exercising 
such jurisdiction, the arbitrator has acted in accordance with 
law, or not, can, of course, always be questioned. While 
examining such a challenge, however, the Court has to be 
mindful of its limitations, in interfering with the decision of 
the arbitrator, especially a decision taken at the discretionary 
level, and at an interlocutory stage. 

50. 
One may also refer, in this context, to Section 5 of the 
1996 Act, which reads as under: 

"5. Extent of judicial intervention.-Notwithstanding 
anything contained in any other law for the time being 
in force, in matters covered by this Part, no judicial 
authority shall intervene except where so provided in 
this Part." 

It is, no doubt, possible to argue that the intent, of Section 5, 
is to restrict judicial intervention, with arbitral proceedings, 
and orders passed therein, to the avenues for such 
interference, as provided by Part I of the 1996 Act, and not to 
restrict the scope of the Sections and the provisions contained 
in Part I. Perhaps. Section 5 remains, however, a clear pointer 
to the legislative intent, permeating the 1996 Act, that judicial 
interference, with arbitral proceedings, is to be kept at a 
minimum. Significantly, in Venture Global Engineering v. 
Satyam Computer Services Ltd. 15 , it was opined that the 
scheme of the 1996 Act was "such that the general provisions 
of Part I, including Section 5, will apply to all Chapters or 
Parts of the Act". In State of Kerala v. Somdatt Builders 
Ltd. 16 , a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court held that 
the jurisdiction of the Court, under Section 37 of the 1996 

15 (2008) 4 SCC 190 
16 2012 (3) Arb LR 151 (Ker) (DB) 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 36 of 48 

Act, was also required to be interpreted in the light of the 
legislative policy contained in Section 5. I entirely agree. 

51. 
The principle of least intervention by courts was held, 
in Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon Gmbh 17 , to be well-
recognised in arbitration jurisprudence, in almost all 
jurisdictions. In a similar vein, earlier in point of time, the 
Supreme Court held, in P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P. V. G. 
Raju 18 , that Section 5 "brings out clearly the object of the 
new Act, namely, that of encouraging resolution of disputes 
expeditiously and less expensively and when there is an 
arbitration agreement, the court's intervention should be 
minimal." Likewise, albeit in the context of Section 34, it was 
held, in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. 
Ltd. 19 , thus: 

"The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory 
role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only 
to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is 
envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of 
fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural 
justice, etc. the court cannot correct errors of the 
arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the 
parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is 
desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at 
keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum 
level and this can be justified as the parties to the 
agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the 
court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they 
prefer the expediency and finality offered by it." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Though the above exposition of the law is in the context of 
Section 34, the principles enunciated therein embody the 
general philosophy underlying the 1996 Act. The italicised 
words, towards the conclusion of the paragraph, especially, 
would apply, with equal force, to challenges to interlocutory 
orders of arbitral tribunals, under Section 37, as they would, 
to challenges to the final award, under Section 34. 

17 (2014) 5 SCC 1 
18 (2000) 4 SCC 539 
19 (2006) 11 SCC 181 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 37 of 48 

52. 
Section 37 is, in a sense, a somewhat peculiar 
provision as, against the decision of the arbitrator, it provides 
for a first appeal, as well as a second appeal, to the High 
Court. Sub-section (1) provides for an appeal, to the High 
Court, from the decision of the Section 34 Court, before 
which the final award has, in the first instance, been tested. 
Sub-section (2), on the other hand, provides for a first appeal, 
against interlocutory orders of the arbitral tribunal under 
Section 16 or Section 17. There is, necessarily, a qualitative 
difference between these two challenges, though both would 
lie to the High Court. The challenge under Section 37(1), 
which is directed against a final award of the 
arbitrator/arbitral tribunal, is akin to a second appeal, as was 
observed by this Court in M.T.N.L. v. Fujitshu India Pvt. 
Ltd. 20 . The challenge under Section 37(2), on the other hand, 
is directed against the decision of the arbitral tribunal and has 
therefore, in my opinion, necessarily to conform to the 
discipline enforced by Section 5. It would, therefore, be 
improper for a Court to treat an appeal, under Section 37 (2) 
of the 1996 Act, as akin to an appeal under the CPC, or as 
understood in ordinary-or extraordinary-civil law. An appeal 
against an order by an arbitrator, or by an arbitral tribunal, is 
an appeal sui generis, and interference, by the Court, in such 
appeals, has to be necessarily cautious and circumspect." 

28.9 Ms Arora has not cited any authority which would 

contradistinguish the principles to be applied while exercising 

jurisdiction under Section 37(2), with those applicable to exercise of 

jurisdiction under Section 34. Given the overarching objectives of the 

1996 Act, I am of the opinion that there is really no substantial 

difference between the two. 

28.10 Consequently, this Court, while exercising jurisdiction under 

Section 37(2)(a) over the impugned order of the letter Arbitrator, 

20 2015 (2) Arb LR 332 (Delhi) 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 38 of 48 

would only examine whether the order suffers from any patent 

illegality or perversity, or is otherwise unconscionable in law on facts. 

The Court does not, therefore, "re-arbitrate" the application decided 

by the learned Arbitrator. If the interpretation of the learned 

Arbitrator is plausible, I would be extremely loath to interfere 

therewith, especially at an interlocutory stage of the arbitral 

proceedings. 

29. Pared down to its essentials, I do not really see that the 

impugned Order, or the view expressed by the learned Arbitrator 

therein, merits interference by the Court. The learned Arbitrator has 

held that the order of termination of the contract, as well as claims 

depended solely on the said order, could not constitute part of the 

arbitral proceedings, as the contract was terminated after the passing 

of the order, dated 11 th October, 2019, by this Court. I am unable to 

understand how this interpretation could be said to be patently illegal, 

perverse, or would otherwise merit interference at the hands of the 

Court. 

30. The jurisdiction of the learned Arbitrator would, 

unquestionably, be governed by the terms of the order dated 11 th 

October, 2019, of this Court. Para 7 of the order, constituting the 

operative portion thereof, appointed the learned Arbitrator "to 

adjudicate the disputes between the parties". The expression "the 

disputes", etymologically, would have to refer to the disputes to which 

the earlier paras of the order allude. Para 5 of the order states thus: 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 39 of 48 

"Disputes have arisen between the parties with respect to the 
said contract". 

The phrase "have arisen" is in the present perfect tense. It refers, 

therefore, to disputes which existed, in praesenti, on the date when the 

order was passed. In Dolphin Drilling v O.N.G.C. 21 , the Supreme 

Court held that the word "all disputes", as employed in the arbitration 

agreement in that case, "can only mean "all disputes" that might be in 

existence when the arbitration clause is invoked and one of the parties 

to the agreement gives the arbitration notice to the other". The notices 

terminating the contract, in the present appeals, were all issued after 

the passing of the concerned referral orders by this Court and were 

not, therefore, in existence on the date when the disputes were 

referred to arbitration. On those dates, the contract between the 

parties was, as yet, not terminated qua the concerned packages. 

31. Apparently cognizant of this factual position, Ms Arora made a 

valiant effort to submit that, by invocation of the Bank Guarantees, 

the contract, ipso facto, stood terminated, even if no "formal" order of 

termination had yet been issued. The contention, quite obviously, has 

been merely to be stated to be rejected. As advanced, the contention 

is contrary both to Clause 50 as well as Clause 8.4 (b) and 8.4 (c)(3) 

of the GCC. A bare reading of these clauses makes it apparent that 

invocation of the Bank Guarantee is a consequence of termination. 

Clause 8.4 (b) states that "whenever the contract is rescind (sic 

rescinded?), the security deposit shall be forfeited and the 

21 (2010) 3 SCC 267 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 40 of 48 

Performance Security shall be encashed. Parallelly, Clause 8.4(c)(3) 

permits the Engineer to make a claim under the Bank Guarantees "in 

the event of the contract being determined or rescinded under the 

provisions of the GCC", in which case "the PG shall be forfeited in 

full and shall be absolutely at the disposal of the Engineer". 

Invocation of the Bank Guarantees could not, therefore, in any event, 

terminate, proprio vigore, the contract between the appellant and the 

respondent. The submission of Ms Arora, if accepted, would amount 

to placing the cart before the horse. 

32. As I have already noted hereinbefore, a pointed query was put, 

to Ms Arora, as to whether, if no order of termination had been issued 

after the Bank Guarantees were encashed, that, by itself, would not 

constitute a ground to challenge the encashment of the Bank 

Guarantees. Ms Arora answered in the affirmative. Significantly, 

even in the Statement of Claim filed before the learned Arbitrator, the 

appellant has challenged the invocation of the Bank Guarantees on the 

ground that, prior to termination of the contract, such invocation was 

not permissible. Having thus taken a stand, both in its pleadings 

before the learned Arbitrator as well as in response to the query posed 

by the Court, that the respondents were not entitled to invoke the 

Bank Guarantees before the contract was terminated, the appellant 

cannot, quite obviously, be urged to contend that, by invocation of the 

Bank Guarantees, the contract stood terminated. That would amount 

to canvassing a stand directly contrary to the pleadings before the 

learned Arbitrator which, quite obviously, is not permissible. While it 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 41 of 48 

is open to a party to take alternative, contrary, pleas, a party cannot 

advance a contention before a court which is directly opposed to the 

stand taken in the pleadings. In any event, Clause 8.4(b) and 8.4(c)(3) 

of the GCC completely eviscerate the contention of Ms Arora that the 

invocation of the Bank Guarantees itself amounted to termination of 

the contract. 

33. I am, in fact, unaware of any contract in which it is open to a 

contracting party to terminate the contract by invoking the 

Performance Security or encashing the Bank Guarantee furnished in 

respect thereof. It is, in fact, difficult to conceive that any 

commercially sensitive contracting party would, willy-nilly, put his 

signature to a contract which permitted invocation of the Bank 

Guarantee even before the contract was terminated. Termination of 

the contract, axiomatically, requires a formal declaration to that effect, 

in writing by the party terminating the contract to the other 

contracting party. The contention of Ms Arora that, by invoking the 

Bank Guarantees furnished by the appellant, the respondent had 

effectively terminated the contract is, therefore, also contrary to the 

basic "common sense" of commercial contracts. It is, accordingly, 

rejected. 

34. The fallout is, therefore, that, as correctly held by the learned 

Arbitrator, the contract was not terminated on the date of passing, by 

this Court, of its order of reference, i.e. on 11 th October, 2019. 

Termination of the contract may have appeared imminent but, on 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 42 of 48 

facts, could not be treated as inevitable. This Court referred, to 

arbitration, the disputes which "have arisen" between the parties as on 

that date. To that extent, the contention, of Ms Arora, that this Court 

had not limited or circumscribed the ambit of the disputes referred to 

arbitration, cannot be accepted. Clearly, the intent of the Court was to 

refer, to arbitration, only the disputes which had arisen, till that date 

and which existed, as on that date, and not disputes relating to events 

which were to take place in the future. No order terminating the 

contract having been issued by the respondent till the date of the 

order, the view, of the learned Arbitrator, that disputes relating to the 

legality of validity of the termination, or claims arising from such 

termination, were not arbitrable before him in the present arbitral 

proceedings, could not be regarded as suffering from patent illegality, 

or a view which was unconscionable either in fact or in law. At the 

very least, it is a plausible view, which is sufficient to dispel any 

attempt, by the Court, to interfere therewith. 

35. No attempt was made by the appellant, even after the filing of 

the application under Section 16 by the respondent, to seek a 

clarification, from this Court, as to whether the "disputes" covered by 

the order dated 11 th October, 2019, would encompass the termination 

of the contract which took place thereafter. In the absence of any such 

clarification, the learned Arbitrator cannot be faulted for the view 

expressed by him in the impugned Order. 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 43 of 48 

36. The reliance, by Ms Arora, on Section 23(3) of the 1996 Act is, 

in my opinion, misplaced. Section 23(3) deals with the right of a 

party to amend or supplement the Statement of Claim or Statement of 

Defence during the course of the arbitral proceedings. No such 

application was filed by the appellant. Section 23(3) does not, 

consequently, even fall for consideration in the present case. 

37. Similarly, Section 4 of the 1996 Act is also of no application 

whatsoever. A bare reading of the said provision makes it apparent 

that it caters to objections by one or the other party to the arbitration 

to raise objections regarding non-compliance with any requirement 

under the arbitration agreement. Quite obviously, this clause does not 

deal with objections regarding jurisdiction, or to the maintainability, 

or arbitrability, of claims. Moreover, Section 16 has not, statutorily, 

been made subject to Section 4 or to any other provision of the 1996 

Act. 
No authority, for the proposition that an objection to 

maintainability of the claim, as being beyond the scope of arbitration, 

could be rejected merely because it was not taken immediately upon 

filing of the Statement of Claim, has been brought to my notice. The 

contention of Ms Arora that the plea of non-arbitrability, in the 

presently pending proceedings before the learned Arbitrator, of the 

legality of the termination by the respondent of the agreement with the 

appellant, was an "afterthought" and had, therefore, to be rejected as 

belated, cannot, therefore, be accepted. Equally, I am unable to 

subscribe to the contention of Ms Arora that, by operation of Section 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 44 of 48 

4, the respondent was estopped from raising the said plea, or that the 

respondent has waived its right to do so. 

38. Praveen Enterprises 5 , too, in my view, cannot help the 

appellant; rather, it may, properly read, militate against the stand 

canvassed by Ms Arora. Para 11 of the said decision, on which Ms 

Arora placed especial reliance, reads thus: 

"11. Reference to arbitration can be in respect of all 
disputes between the parties or all disputes regarding a 
contract or in respect of specific enumerated disputes. Where 
"all disputes" are referred, the arbitrator has the jurisdiction to 
decide all disputes raised in the pleadings (both claims and 
counterclaims) subject to any limitations placed by the 
arbitration agreement. Where the arbitration agreement 
provides that all disputes shall be settled by arbitration but 
excludes certain matters from arbitration, then, the arbitrator 
will exclude the excepted matter and decide only those 
disputes which are arbitrable. But where the reference to the 
arbitrator is to decide specific disputes enumerated by the 
parties/court/appointing 
authority, 
the 
arbitrator's 
jurisdiction is circumscribed by the specific reference and the 
arbitrator can decide only those specific disputes." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Para 11 of the decision in Praveen Enterprises 5 would be better 

appreciated if read in conjunction with para 12, which may be 

reproduced, therefore, thus: 

"12. Though an arbitration agreement generally provides 
for settlement of future disputes by reference to arbitration, 
there can be "ad hoc" arbitrations relating to existing 
disputes. In such cases, there is no prior arbitration agreement 
to refer future disputes to arbitration. After a dispute arises 
between the parties, they enter into an arbitration agreement 
to refer that specific dispute to arbitration. In such an 
arbitration, the arbitrator cannot enlarge the scope of 
arbitration by permitting either the claimant to modify or add 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 45 of 48 

to the claim or the respondent to make a counterclaim. The 
arbitrator can only decide the dispute referred to him, unless 
the parties again agree to refer the additional 
disputes/counterclaims to arbitration and authorise the 
arbitrator to decide them." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Though rendered in the context of ad hoc arbitrations, the concluding 

sentence in the afore extracted para 12 of the judgement in Praveen 

Enterprises 5 applies, mutatis mutandis, to the present case, and also 

aids in appreciating the extent to which para 11 would apply. 

39. The learned Arbitrator has taken the view that the order, dated 

11 th October, 2019, referred, to him, only disputes which were in 

existence on that date and did not, therefore, cover the legality of the 

termination order which was yet to be issued. The view is, in my 

view, undoubtedly plausible. 

40. The sequitur would be that the disputes referred to the learned 

Arbitrator would only be those disputes which were existing, in 

praesenti, on 11 th October, 2019, when the order was passed by the 

Court. Packages SS3-B and SS2-C were terminated on 11 th October, 

2019, but a reading of the order passed by this Court, on the said date, 

indicates that, at the time of passing the order, the order of termination 

had yet to be served on the appellant. I may note, here, that it is 

nobody's case -and, indeed, Ms Arora, too, does not advance the 

initial submission -that this Court was seized with the fact that the 

contract already stood terminated, qua these packages. Indeed, a 

reading of the order dated 11 th October, 2019, makes it apparent that, 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 46 of 48 

till the passing of the said order, at least, no termination of the 

contract had taken place or, at the very least, that this Court was never 

made aware of any such order of termination. Qua Package SS2-C, 

the contract was terminated on 22 nd October, 2019, after the passing of 

the order, by this Court, on 14 th October, 2019. In any event, Ms 

Arora does not dispute the factual position that, at the time of passing 

of the concerned referral orders by this Court, the contract, qua the 

package(s) forming subject matter thereof, was yet to be terminated. 

The learned Arbitrator was, therefore, prima facie justified in taking 

the view that this Court did not refer, or intend to refer, for arbitration, 

the legality of the actual order of termination which came to be passed 

on 11 th October, 2019 or 22 nd October, 2019, or any claims arising as 

a result thereof. 

41. Whether any other view was possible, or not, is not for this 

Court to deliberate upon. Any such exercise would transgress the 

authority vested in it by law. Once the Court finds that the view taken 

by the learned Arbitrator was a plausible view, then, given the 

pervading philosophy of the 1996 Act, which is to minimise 

interference, by Courts, with the arbitral process, the Court must 

necessarily step back and decline to interfere. 

42. The expansive contours of the arbitration agreement, as 

contained in the GCC, too, cannot help the appellant. Undoubtedly, 

the arbitration agreement covers "all disputes and differences of any 

kind whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the contract… 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 47 of 48 

whether before or after the determination of the contract". Ms Arora 

maybe right in her contention that the termination of the contract was 

also a dispute referrable to arbitration. The question is, however, not 

whether the dispute was referrable to arbitration, but whether it had 

been referred to arbitration by this Court on 11 th October, 2019 and 

14 th October, 2019. As the Supreme Court observed in Praveen 

Enterprises 5 , once there was a specific reference to arbitration, the 

arbitration would have to abide by the terms of such reference, and 

only those disputes, which were referred to arbitration, could be 

arbitrated. The order, dated 11 th October, 2019, specifically referred, 

to arbitration, disputes which "have arisen between the parties". To 

the same effect is the order dated 14 th October, 2019. Plainly, the 

order of termination not having been passed till then, the legality, or 

otherwise, thereof, or any claims consequent thereto, could not be 

regarded as disputes which "had arisen", till then, between the parties. 

The jurisdiction of the learned Arbitrator having been circumscribed 

by the order of reference of this Court, no fault can be found with the 

interpretation, by the learned Arbitrator, that the reference did not 

encompass the legality, or otherwise, of the order of termination, 

which came to be passed later. 

43. The challenge, by the appellant, to the impugned Order dated 

5 th March, 2021, insofar as it excludes, from the scope of the arbitral 

proceedings, disputes regarding the legality of the order of termination 

of the contract between the appellant and the respondent, as well as 

claims based on such termination, therefore, fails. 


Arb. A. (Comm) 15/2021, Arb. A. (Comm) 16/2021 & 
Arb. A. (Comm) 17/2021 
Page 48 of 48 

44. Insofar as the challenge to the finding, of the learned Arbitrator, 

regarding non-arbitrability of "excepted" matters, is concerned, while 

no patent error may be found even in that regard, Ms Arora restricts 

the prayer to an observation, by this Court, that the finding of the 

learned Arbitrator may be treated as prima facie in nature. To the 

limited extent, I see no objection to accede to the submission of Ms. 

Arora. While, therefore, not interfering with the finding, of the 

learned Arbitrator, that excepted matters were not amenable to 

arbitration, it is clarified that the finding would be treated as prima 

facie in nature. The appellant would, therefore, be at liberty, at the 

stage of final hearing before the learned Arbitrator, to argue against 

such prima facie finding. I am inclined to grant this much latitude to 

the appellant only as the impugned order has been passed at the 

interlocutory stage, and keeping in mind the interests of an 

expeditious resolution of the arbitral exercise. 

Conclusion 

45. Subject to the limited caveat in para 44 supra, the appeals are, 

consequently, dismissed in limine, with no orders as to costs.
