R.F. Nariman, J. 

1. 
The present petitions assail the constitutional validity of various 

provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 [-Insolvency 

Code‖ or -Code‖]. Since we are deciding only questions relating to the 

constitutional validity of the Code, we are not going into the individual 

facts of any case. 

2. 
Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate, appearing in Writ 

Petition (Civil) No. 99 of 2018, has first and foremost argued that the 

members of the National Company Law Tribunal [-NCLT‖] and certain 

members of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal [-NCLAT‖], 

apart from the President, have been appointed contrary to this Court's 

judgment in Madras Bar Association v. Union of India, (2015) 8 

SCC 583 [-Madras Bar Association (III)‖], and that therefore, this 

being so, all orders that are passed by such members, being passed 

contrary to the judgment of this Court in the aforesaid case, ought to 

be set aside. In any case, even assuming that the de facto doctrine 

would apply to save such orders, it is clear that such members ought to 

be restrained from passing any orders in future. In any case, until a 


3 

properly constituted committee, in accordance with the aforesaid 

judgment, reappoints them, they ought not to be allowed to function. 

He also argued that the administrative support for all tribunals should 

be from the Ministry of Law and Justice. However, even today, NCLT 

and NCLAT are functioning under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. 

This again needs to be corrected immediately. A further technical 

violation also exists in that if the powers of the High Court are taken 

away, the NCLAT, as an appellate forum, should have the same 

convenience and expediency as existed prior to appeals going to the 

NCLAT. Since the NCLAT, as an appellate court, has a seat only at 

New Delhi, this would render the remedy inefficacious inasmuch as 

persons would have to travel from Tamil Nadu, Calcutta, and Bombay 

to New Delhi, whereas earlier, they could have approached the 

respective High Courts in their States. This again is directly contrary to 

Madras Bar Association v. Union of India, (2014) 10 SCC 1 

[-Madras Bar Association (II)‖], and to paragraph 123 in particular. 

Apart from the aforesaid technical objection, Shri Rohatgi assailed the 

legislative scheme that is contained in Section 7 of the Code, stating 

that there is no real difference between financial creditors and 

operational creditors. According to him, both types of creditors would 


4 

give either money in terms of loans or money's worth in terms of goods 

and services. Thus, there is no intelligible differentia between the two 

types of creditors, regard being had to the object sought to be 

achieved by the Code, namely, insolvency resolution, and if that is not 

possible, then ultimately, liquidation. Relying upon Shayara Bano v. 

Union of India, (2017) 9 SCC 1 [-Shayara Bano‖], he argued that 

such classification will not only be discriminatory, but also manifestly 

arbitrary, as under Sections 8 and 9 of the Code, an operational debtor 

is not only given notice of default, but is entitled to dispute the 

genuineness of the claim. In the case of a financial debtor, on the other 

hand, no notice is given and the financial debtor is not entitled to 

dispute the claim of the financial creditor. It is enough that a default as 

defined occurs, after which, even if the claim is disputed and even if 

there be a set-off and counterclaim, yet, the Code gets triggered at the 

behest of a financial creditor, without the corporate debtor being able 

to justify the fact that a genuine dispute is raised, which ought to be left 

for adjudication before ordinary courts and/or tribunals. Shri Rohatgi 

then argued that assuming that a valid distinction exists between 

financial and operational creditors, there is hostile discrimination 

against operational creditors. First and foremost, unless they amount 


5 

to 10% of the aggregate of the amount of debt owed, they have no 

voice in the committee of creditors. In any case, Sections 21 and 24 of 

the Code are discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary in that operational 

creditors do not have even a single vote in the committee of creditors 

which has very important functions to perform in the resolution process 

of corporate debtors. Shri Rohatgi then went on to assail the 

establishment of information utilities that are set up under the Code. 

According to him, under Section 210 of the Code, there can be private 

information utilities whose sole object would be to make a profit. 

Further, the said information utility is not only to collect financial data, 

but also to check whether a default has or has not occurred. 

Certification of such agency cannot substitute for adjudication. Thus, 

the certificate of an information utility is in the nature of a preliminary 

decree issued without any hearing and without any process of 

adjudication. Shri Rohatgi next argued that Section 12A of the Code is 

contrary to the directions of this Court in its order in Uttara Foods and 

Feeds Pvt. Ltd. v. Mona Pharmachem, Civil Appeal No. 18520/2017 

[decided on 13.11.2017], and that instead of following the said order, 

Section 12A now derails the settlement process by requiring the 

approval of at least ninety per cent of the voting share of the committee 


6 

of creditors. Unbridled and uncanalized power is given to the 

committee of creditors to reject legitimate settlements entered into 

between creditors and the corporate debtors. Shri Rohatgi then argued 

that the resolution professional, having been given powers of 

adjudication under the Code and Regulations, grant of adjudicatory 

power to a non-judicial authority is violative of basic aspects of 

dispensation of justice and access to justice. Lastly, a four-fold attack 

was raised against Section 29A, in particular, clause (c) thereof. First 

and foremost, Shri Rohatgi stated that the vested rights of erstwhile 

promoters to participate in the recovery process of a corporate debtor 

have been impaired by retrospective application of Section 29A. 

Section 29A, in any case, is contrary to the object sought to be 

achieved by the Code, in particular, speedy disposal of the resolution 

process as it will inevitably lead to challenges before the Adjudicating 

Authority and Appellate Authority, which will slow down and delay the 

insolvency resolution process. In particular, so far as Section 29A(c) is 

concerned, a blanket ban on participation of all promoters of corporate 

debtors, without any mechanism to weed out those who are 

unscrupulous and have brought the company to the ground, as against 

persons who are efficient managers, but who have not been able to 


7 

pay their debts due to various other reasons, would not only be 

manifestly arbitrary, but also be treating unequals as equals. Also, 

according to Shri Rohatgi, maximization of value of assets is an 

important goal to be achieved in the resolution process. Section 29A is 

contrary to such goal as an erstwhile promoter, who may outbid all 

other applicants and may have the best resolution plan, would be kept 

out at the threshold, thereby impairing the object of maximization of 

value of assets. Another argument that was made was that under 

Section 29A(c), a person's account may be classified as a non-

performing asset [-NPA‖] in accordance with the guidelines of the 

Reserve Bank of India [-RBI‖], despite him not being a wilful defaulter. 

Also, the period of one year referred to in clause (c) is again wholly 

arbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law. Shri 

Rohatgi then trained his gun on Section 29A(j), and stated that persons 

who may be related parties in the sense that they may be relatives of 

the erstwhile promoters are also debarred, despite the fact that they 

may have no business connection with the erstwhile promoters who 

have been rendered ineligible by Section 29A. 

3. 
Shri K.V. Viswanathan, learned Senior Advocate, appearing in 

Writ Petition No.822 of 2018, strongly supported Shri Rohatgi and 


8 

argued the same points with great clarity and with various nuances of 

his own, which will be reflected in our judgment. Followed by Shri 

Viswanathan, Shri A.K. Gupta, Shri Pulkit Deora, Shri Devanshu Sajlan 

and Shri Deepak Joshi also made submissions with particular regard to 

discrimination against operational creditors. 

4. 
As against these submissions, Shri K.K. Venugopal, the learned 

Attorney General for India, and Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor 

General for India, appearing for the Union of India, and Shri Rakesh 

Dwivedi, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the Reserve Bank of 

India, countered all the aforesaid submissions. They argued with 

reference to our judgments and Committee Reports that till the 

Insolvency Code was enacted, the regime of previous legislation had 

failed to maximize the value of stressed assets and had focused on 

reviving the corporate debtor with the same erstwhile management. All 

these legislations had failed, as a result of which, the Code was 

enacted to reorganize insolvency resolution of corporate debtors in a 

time bound manner to maximize the value of assets of such person. 

They further argued that there is a paradigm shift from the erstwhile 

management of a corporate debtor being in possession of stressed 

assets to creditors who now assume control from the erstwhile 


9 

management and are able to approve resolution plans of other better 

and more efficient managers, which would not only be in the interest of 

the corporate debtor itself but in the interest of all stakeholders, 

namely, all creditors, workers, and shareholders other than 

shareholdings of the erstwhile management. They referred to the 

Statement of Objects and Reasons, the Preamble, and various 

provisions of the Code, and to the Rules and Regulations made 

thereunder, to buttress their submissions. In particular, they referred to 

judgments which mandated a judicial hands-off when it came to laws 

relating to economic regulation. They argued that the legislature must 

get the maximum free play in the joints to experiment and come up 

with solutions to problems that have seemed intractable earlier. In 

particular, in combating the individual points made by the learned 

counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, they argued that none 

of the members of the NCLT or the NCLAT had been appointed 

contrary to the judgments of this Court in Union of India v. R. Gandhi, 

President, Madras Bar Association (2010) 11 SCC 1 [-Madras Bar 

Association (I)‖] and Madras Bar Association (III) (supra). They 

referred to affidavits filed before this Court to show that all such 

members had been appointed by a Committee consisting of two 


10 

Supreme Court Judges and two bureaucrats, in conformity with the 

aforesaid judgments. When it came to classification between financial 

and operational creditors, they argued that the differentiation between 

the two types of creditors occurs from the nature of the contracts 

entered into with them. Financial contracts involve large sums of 

money given by fewer persons, whereas operational creditors are 

much larger in number and the quantum of dues is generally small. 

Financial creditors have specified repayment schedules and 

agreements which entitle such creditors to recall the loan in totality on 

defaults being made, which the operational creditors do not have. 

Further, financial creditors are, from the start, involved with the 

assessment of viability of corporate debtors and are, therefore, better 

equipped to engage in restructuring of loans as well as reorganization 

of the corporate debtor's business in the event of financial stress. All 

these differentiae are not only intelligible, but directly relate to the 

objects sought to be achieved by the Code. Insofar as Section 7, 

relatable to financial creditors, and Sections 8 and 9, which relate to 

operational creditors are concerned, it is a fallacy to say that no notice 

is issued to the financial debtor on defaults made, as financial debtors 

are fully aware of the loan structure and the defaults that have been 


11 

made. Further, this Court's judgment in Innoventive Industries Ltd. v. 

ICICI Bank and Anr., (2018) 1 SCC 407 [-Innoventive Industries‖] 

has made it clear that under Section 7(5) of the Code, the Adjudicating 

Authority, in being -satisfied‖ that there is a default, has to issue notice 

to the corporate debtor, hear the corporate debtor, and then adjudicate 

upon the same. The reason why disputes raised by financial debtors 

are not gone into at the stage of triggering the Code is because the 

evidence of financial debts are contained in the documents of 

information utilities, banks, and financial institutions. Disputes which 

may be raised can be raised at the stage of filing of claims once the 

resolution process is underway. Also, by the very nature of financial 

debts, set-off and counterclaims by financial debtors are very rare and, 

in any case, wholly independent of the loan that has been granted to 

them. Insofar as operational creditors having no vote in the committee 

of creditors is concerned, this is because operational creditors are 

typically interested only in getting payment for supply of goods or 

services made by them, whereas financial creditors are typically 

involved in seeing that the entirety of their loan gets repaid, for which 

they are better equipped to go into the viability of corporate 

enterprises, both at the stage of grant of the loan and at the stage of 


12 

default. Also, the interests of operational creditors, when a resolution 

plan is to be approved, are well looked-after as the minimum that the 

operational creditors are to be paid is the liquidation value of assets. 

Apart from this, their interests are to be placed at par with the interests 

of financial creditors, and if this is not done, then the Adjudicating 

Authority intervenes to reject or modify resolution plans until the same 

is done. In the 80 cases that have been resolved since the Code has 

come into force, figures were also shown to this Court to indicate that 

not only are the operational creditors paid before the financial creditors 

under the resolution plan, but that the initial recovery of what is owed 

to them is slightly higher than what is owed to financial creditors. 

Insofar as Section 12A is concerned, they argued that once an 

application by a creditor is admitted by the Adjudicating Authority, the 

proceeding becomes a proceeding in rem and is no longer an 

individual proceeding but a collective proceeding. This being the case, 

it is important that when a resolution process is to begin and a 

committee of creditors is formed, it is that committee that is best 

equipped to deal with applications for withdrawal or settlement after 

admission of an insolvency petition. Ninety per cent of such creditors 

have been given this task as once the proceeding is in rem, to halt 


13 

such proceeding, which is for the benefit of all creditors generally, can 

only be if all or most of them agree to the same. They argued that the 

resolution professional has no adjudicatory powers under the Code or 

the Regulations, but is only to collate information. Even when he 

exercises his discretion to exercise his best judgment in certain 

situations, he does so administratively, and is subject to an 

adjudicatory body overseeing the same. When it comes to Section 29A 

of the Code, they argued that Section 29A does not disturb any vested 

or existing rights, as a resolution applicant does not have any vested or 

existing rights that can be disturbed, as has been held in ArcelorMittal 

India Private Limited v. Satish Kumar Gupta and Ors., Civil Appeal 

Nos. 9402-9405/2018 [decided on 04.10.2018] [-ArcelorMittal‖]. 

Further, merely because this Section relies on antecedent facts for its 

application, does not mean that it is retrospective. Also, Section 29A 

subserves a very important object of the Code, which is to see that 

undesirable persons who are mentioned in all its clauses are rendered 

ineligible to submit resolution plans so that such persons may not 

come into the management of stressed corporate debtors. They also 

argued that Section 29A is not aimed at only persons who have 

committed acts of malfeasance, but also persons who are otherwise 


14 

unfit to be put in the saddle of the management of the corporate 

debtor, such as undischarged insolvents and persons who have been 

removed as directors under Section 164 of the Companies Act, 2013 

(for not filing financial statements or annual returns for any continuous 

period of 3 financial years, for example). They further argued that a 

period of one year is sufficient period within which a person, whose 

account has been declared NPA, should clear its dues. They referred 

to the RBI Regulations dealing with NPAs and stated that even before 

a person's account is declared NPA, a long rope is given for such 

person to clear off its debts. It is only when it does not do so, that its 

account is declared NPA in the first instance. Also, once the said 

guidelines are perused, it is clear that an account, which has been 

NPA for one year, is declared as substandard asset and it is for this 

reason that the one year period is given in Section 29A(c), which is 

based on reason, and is not arbitrary. 

5. 
Shri C.U. Singh, appearing on behalf of the Asset Reconstruction 

Company of India Limited, referred to the pre-existing state of 

legislation before the Code was enacted, and referred in detail to how 

all such legislations had failed to produce the necessary results. He 

also relied upon extracts from the Insolvency Act, 1986 of the United 


15 

Kingdom to buttress his point that worldwide, Insolvency Acts have 

moved away from mere liquidation so as to first concentrate on 

reconstruction of corporate debtors. Also, according to him, Section 

29A is not a Section aimed at malfeasance; it is aimed at rendering 

ineligible persons who are undesirable in the widest sense of the term, 

i.e., persons who are unfit to take over the management of a corporate 

debtor. 

PROLOGUE: THE PRE-EXISTING STATE OF THE LAW 

6. 
Having heard the rival contentions, it is important to first clear the 

air on what was the background which led to the enactment of the 

Insolvency Code. The erstwhile regime which led to the enactment of 

the Insolvency Code was discussed by the Bankruptcy Law Reforms 

Committee [-BLRC‖] in its Report dated 04.11.2015 as follows: 

-The current state of the bankruptcy process for firms 
is a highly fragmented framework. Powers of the 
creditor and the debtor under insolvency are provided 
for under different Acts. Given the conflicts between 
creditors and debtors in the resolution of insolvency as 
described in Section 3.2.2, the chances for 
consistency and efficiency in resolution are low when 
rights are separately defined. It is problematic that 
these different laws are implemented in different 
judicial fora. Cases that are decided at the 
tribunal/BIFR often come for review to the High Courts. 
This gives rise to two types of problems in 


16 

implementation of the resolution framework. The first 
is the lack of clarity of jurisdiction. In a situation where 
one forum decides on matters relating to the rights of 
the creditor, while another decides on those relating to 
the rights of the debtor, the decisions are readily 
appealed against and either stayed or overturned in a 
higher court. Ideally, if economic value is indeed to be 
preserved, there must be a single forum that hears 
both sides of the case and makes a judgment based 
on both. A second problem exacerbates the problems 
of multiple judicial fora. The fora entrusted with 
adjudicating on matters relating to insolvency and 
bankruptcy may not have the business or financial 
expertise, information or bandwidth to decide on such 
matters. This leads to delays and extensions in 
arriving at an outcome, and increases the vulnerability 
to appeals of the outcome. 

The uncertainty that these problems give rise to shows 
up in case law on matters of insolvency and 
bankruptcy in India. Judicial precedent is set by -case 
law‖ which helps flesh out the statutory laws. These 
may also, in some cases, pronounce new substantive 
law where the statute and precedent are silent. (Ravi, 
2015) reviews judgments of the High Courts on BIFR 
cases, the DRTs and DRATs, as well as a review of 
important judgments of the Supreme Court that have 
had a significant impact on the interpretation of 
existing insolvency legislation. The judgments 
reviewed are those after June 2002 when the 
SARFAESI Act came into effect. It is illustrative of 
both debtor and creditor led process of corporate 
insolvency, and reveals a matrix of fragmented and 
contrary outcomes, rather than coherent and 
consistent, being set as precedents. 

In such an environment of legislative and judicial 
uncertainty, the outcomes on insolvency and 
bankruptcy are poor. World Bank (2014) reports that 
the average time to resolve insolvency is four years in 
India, compared to 0.8 years in Singapore and 1 year 


17 

in London. Sengupta and Sharma, 2015 compare the 
number of new cases that file for corporate insolvency 
in the U.K., which has a robust insolvency law, to the 
status of cases registered at the BIFR under SICA, 
1985, as well as those filed for liquidation under 
Companies Act, 1956. They compare this with the 
number of cases files in the UK, and find a significantly 
higher turnover in the cases that are filed and cleared 
through the insolvency process in the UK. If we are to 
bring financing patterns back on track with the global 
norm, we must create a legal framework to make debt 
contracts credible channels of financing. 

This calls for a deeper redesign of the entire resolution 
process, rather than working on strengthening any 
single piece of it. India is not unusual in requiring this. 
In all countries, bankruptcy laws undergo significant 
changes over the period of two decades or more. For 
example, the insolvency resolution framework in the 
UK is the Insolvency Act of 1986, which was 
substantially modified with the Insolvency Act of 2000, 
and the Enterprise Act of 2002. The first Act for 
bankruptcy resolution in the US that lasted for a 
significant time was the Bankruptcy Act of 1889. This 
was followed by the Act of 1938, the Reform Act of 
1978, the Act of 1984, the Act of 1994, a related 
consumer protection Act of 2005. Singapore proposed 
a bankruptcy reform in 2013, while there are significant 
changes that are being proposed in the US and the 
Italian bankruptcy framework this year in 2015. 
Several of these are structural reforms with 
fundamental implications on resolving insolvency….‖ 

The BLRC went on to state: 

-[…..] India is one of the youngest republics in the 
world, with a high concentration of the most dynamic 
entrepreneurs. Yet these game changers and growth 
drivers are crippled by an environment that takes 
some of the longest times and highest costs by world 


18 

standards to resolve any problems that arise while 
repaying dues on debt. This problem leads to grave 
consequences: India has some of the lowest credit 
compared to the size of the economy. This is a 
troublesome state to be in, particularly for a young 
emerging economy with the entrepreneurial dynamism 
of India.‖ 

xxx xxx xxx 

-Speed is of essence for the working of the bankruptcy 
code, for two reasons. First, while the ‗calm period' 
can help keep an organization afloat, without the full 
clarity of ownership and control, significant decisions 
cannot be made. Without effective leadership, the firm 
will tend to atrophy and fail. The longer the delay, the 
more likely it is that liquidation will be the only answer. 
Second, the liquidation value tends to go down with 
time as many assets suffer from a high economic rate 
of depreciation. 

From the viewpoint of creditors, a good realization can 
generally be obtained if the firm is sold as a going 
concern. Hence, when delays induce liquidation, there 
is value destruction. Further, even in liquidation, the 
realization is lower when there are delays. Hence, 
delays cause value destruction. Thus, achieving a 
high recovery rate is primarily about identifying and 
combating the sources of delay. 

This same idea is found in FSLRC's (Financial Sector 
Legislative Reforms Commission) treatment of the 
failure of financial firms. The most important objective 
in designing a legal framework for dealing with firm 
failure is the need for speed.‖ 

The pre-existing scenario has been noticed in some of our judgments. 

In Madras Petrochem Ltd. and Anr. v. Board for Industrial and 


19 

Financial Reconstruction and Ors., (2016) 4 SCC 1, this Court 

found: 

-40.……The Eradi Committee Report relating to 
insolvency and winding up of companies dated 31-7-
2000, observed that out of 3068 cases referred to 
BIFR from 1987 to 2000 all but 1062 cases have been 
disposed of. Out of the cases disposed of, 264 cases 
were revived, 375 cases were under negotiation for 
revival process, 741 cases were recommended for 
winding up, and 626 cases were dismissed as not 
maintainable. These facts and figures speak for 
themselves and place a big question mark on the utility 
of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) 
Act, 1985. The Committee further pointed out that 
effectiveness of the Sick Industrial Companies 
(Special Provisions) Act, 1985 as has been pointed out 
earlier, has been severely undermined by reason of 
the enormous delays involved in the disposal of cases 
by BIFR. (See Paras 5.8, 5.9 and 5.15 of the Report.) 
Consequently, the Committee recommended that the 
Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 
1985 be repealed and the provisions thereunder for 
revival and rehabilitation should be telescoped into the 
structure of the Companies Act, 1956 itself.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

xxx xxx xxx 

-43.……In fact, another interesting document is the 
Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 
2011-2012 for the year ended 30-6-2012 submitted by 
Reserve Bank of India to the Central Government in 
terms of Section 36(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949. In Table IV.14 the Report provides statistics 
regarding trends in non-performing assets bank-wise, 
group-wise. As per the said Table, the opening 
balance of non-performing assets in public sector 
banks for the year 2011-2012 was Rs 746 billion but 
the closing balance for 2011-2012 was Rs 1172 billion 


20 

only. The total amount recovered through the 
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets 
and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 during 
2011-2012 registered a decline compared to the 
previous year, but, even then, the amounts recovered 
under the said Act constituted 70% of the total amount 
recovered. The amounts recovered under the 
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial 
Institutions Act, 1993 constituted only 28%. All this 
would go to show that the amounts that public sector 
banks and financial institutions have to recover are in 
staggering figures and at long last at least one 
statutory measure has proved to be of some efficacy. 
This Court would be loathe to give such an 
interpretation as would thwart the recovery process 
under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of 
Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest 
Act, 2002 which Act alone seems to have worked to 
some extent at least.‖ 

Similarly, in Innoventive Industries (supra), this Court found: 

-13. One of the important objectives of the Code is to 
bring the insolvency law in India under a single unified 
umbrella with the object of speeding up of the 
insolvency process. As per the data available with the 
World Bank in 2016, insolvency resolution in India took 
4.3 years on an average, which was much higher 
when compared with the United Kingdom (1 year), 
USA (1.5 years) and South Africa (2 years). The World 
Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, 2015, ranked 
India as country number 135 out of 190 countries on 
the ease of resolving insolvency based on various 
indicia.‖ 

Further, this Court in ArcelorMittal (supra) observed: 

-62. Previous legislation, namely, the Sick Industrial 
Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, and the 


21 

Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial 
Institutions Act, 1993, which made provision for 
rehabilitation of sick companies and repayment of 
loans availed by them, were found to have completely 
failed. This was taken note of by our judgment 
in Madras Petrochem Ltd. v. Board for Industrial and 
Financial Reconstruction, (2016) 4 SCC 1……‖ 

xxx xxx xxx 

-63. These two enactments were followed by the 
Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets 
and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002. As 
has been noted hereinabove, amounts recovered 
under the said Act recorded improvement over the 
previous two enactments, but this was yet found to be 
inadequate.‖ 

JUDICIAL HANDS-OFF QUA ECONOMIC LEGISLATION 

7. 
In the United States, at one point of time, Justice Stephen Field's 

dissents of the 19 th Century were translated into majority opinions in 

the early 20 th Century. This was referred to as the Lochner era, in 

which the U.S. Supreme Court, over a period of 40 years, consistently 

struck down legislation which was economic in nature as such 

legislation did not, according to the Court, square with property rights. 

As a result, a large number of minimum wage laws, maximum hours of 

work in factories laws, child labour laws, etc. were struck down. The 

result, as is well known, is that President Roosevelt initiated a court-

packing plan in which he sought to get authorization from Congress to 


22 

appoint additional judges to the Supreme Court, who would have then 

overruled the Lochner line of precedents. As it turned out, that became 

unnecessary as Justice Roberts switched his vote so that a 5:4 

majority from 1937 onwards upheld economic legislation. It is important 

to note that the dissents of Justice Holmes and Justice Brandeis now 

became the law. Justice Holmes had, in his dissent in Lochner v. New 

York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905), stated: 

-This case is decided upon an economic theory 
which a large part of the country does not entertain. If 
it were a question whether I agreed with that theory, I 
should desire to study it further and long before 
making up my mind. But I do not conceive that to be 
my duty, because I strongly believe that my agreement 
or disagreement has nothing to do with the right of a 
majority to embody their opinions in law. It is settled by 
various decisions of this court that state constitutions 
and state laws may regulate life in many ways which 
we, as legislators, might think as injudicious, or, if you 
like, as tyrannical, as this, and which, equally with this, 
interfere with the liberty to contract. Sunday laws and 
usury laws are ancient examples. A more modern one 
is the prohibition of lotteries. The liberty of the citizen 
to do as he likes so long as he does not interfere with 
the liberty of others to do the same, which has been a 
shibboleth for some well-known writers, is interfered 
with by school laws, by the Post Office, by every state 
or municipal institution which takes his money for 
purposes thought desirable, whether he likes it or not. 
The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. 
Herbert Spencer's Social Statics. The other day, we 
sustained the Massachusetts vaccination law. 
Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11. United 


23 

States and state statutes and decisions cutting down 
the liberty to contract by way of combination are 
familiar to this court. Northern Securities Co. v. United 
States, 193 U. S. 197. Two years ago, we upheld the 
prohibition of sales of stock on margins or for future 
delivery in the constitution of California. Otis v. 
Parker, 187 U. S. 606. The decision sustaining an 
eight hour law for miners is still recent. Holden v. 
Hardy, 169 U. S. 366. Some of these laws embody 
convictions or prejudices which judges are likely to 
share. Some may not. But a constitution is not 
intended to embody a particular economic theory, 
whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the 
citizen to the State or of laissez faire. 

It is made for people of fundamentally differing 
views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions 
natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought 
not to conclude our judgment upon the question 
whether statutes embodying them conflict with the 
Constitution of the United States. 

General propositions do not decide concrete 
cases. The decision will depend on a judgment or 
intuition more subtle than any articulate major premise. 
But I think that the proposition just stated, if it is 
accepted, will carry us far toward the end. Every 
opinion tends to become a law. I think that the word 
liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment is perverted 
when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a 
dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a rational 
and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute 
proposed would infringe fundamental principles as 
they have been understood by the traditions of our 
people and our law. It does not need research to show 
that no such sweeping condemnation can be passed 
upon the statute before us. A reasonable man might 
think it a proper measure on the score of health. Men 
whom I certainly could not pronounce unreasonable 
would uphold it as a first instalment of a general 
regulation of the hours of work. Whether in the latter 


24 

aspect it would be open to the charge of inequality I 
think it unnecessary to discuss.‖ 1 

Similarly, in New State Ice Co. v. Liebman, 285 U.S. 262 (1932), 

Justice Brandeis echoed Justice Holmes as follows: 

-The discoveries in physical science, the 
triumphs in invention, attest the value of the process of 
trial and error. In large measure, these advances have 
been due to experimentation. In those fields 
experimentation has, for two centuries, been not only 
free but encouraged. Some people assert that our 
present plight is due, in part, to the limitations set by 
courts upon experimentation in the fields of social and 
economic science; and to the discouragement to which 
proposals for betterment there have been subjected 
otherwise. There must be power in the States and the 
Nation to remould, through experimentation, our 
economic practices and institutions to meet changing 
social and economic needs. I cannot believe that the 
framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the States 
which ratified it, intended to deprive us of the power to 
correct the evils of technological unemployment and 
excess productive capacity which have attended 
progress in the useful arts. 

To stay experimentation in things social and 
economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right 
to experiment may be fraught with serious 
consequences to the Nation. It is one of the happy 
incidents of the federal system that a single 
courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as 
a laboratory; and try novel social and economic 
experiments without risk to the rest of the country. This 
Court has the power to prevent an experiment. We 
may strike down the statute which embodies it on the 

1 Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 75-76 (1905). 


25 

ground that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, 
capricious or unreasonable. We have power to do this, 
because the due process clause has been held by the 
Court applicable to matters of substantive law as well 
as to matters of procedure. But in the exercise of this 
high power, we must be ever on our guard, lest we 
erect our prejudices into legal principles. If we would 
guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be 
bold.‖ 2 

The Lochner doctrine was finally buried in Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 

U.S. 726 (1962), where the Supreme Court held: 

-Both the District Court in the present case and 
the Pennsylvania court in Stone adopted the 
philosophy of Adams v. Tanner, and cases like it, that 
it is the province of courts to draw on their own views 
as to the morality, legitimacy, and usefulness of a 
particular business in order to decide whether a statute 
bears too heavily upon that business and, by so doing, 
violates due process. Under the system of government 
created by our Constitution, it is up to legislatures, not 
courts, to decide on the wisdom and utility of 
legislation. There was a time when the Due Process 
Clause was used by this Court to strike down laws 
which were thought unreasonable, that is, unwise or 
incompatible with some particular economic or social 
philosophy. In this manner, the Due Process Clause 
was used, for example, to nullify laws prescribing 
maximum hours for work in bakeries, Lochner v. New 
York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), outlawing -yellow dog‖ 
contracts, Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1 (1915), 
setting minimum wages for women, Adkins v. 
Children's Hospital, 261 U. S. 525 (1923), and fixing 

2 New State Ice Co. v. Liebman, 285 U.S. 262, 310-311 (1932). 


26 

the weight of loaves of bread, Jay Burns Baking Co. v. 
Bryan, 264 U. S. 504 (1924). This intrusion by the 
judiciary into the realm of legislative value judgments 
was strongly objected to at the time, particularly by Mr. 
Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandeis. Dissenting 
from the Court's invalidating a state statute which 
regulated the resale price of theatre and other tickets, 
Mr. Justice Holmes said, 

-I think the proper course is to recognize that 
a state Legislature can do whatever it sees fit 
to do unless it is restrained by some express 
prohibition in the Constitution of the United 
States or of the State, and that Courts should 
be careful not to extend such prohibitions 
beyond their obvious meaning by reading into 
them conceptions of public policy that the 
particular Court may happen to entertain. 

And, in an earlier case, he had emphasized that, 
‗The criterion of constitutionality is not whether we 
believe the law to be for the public good' [Adkins v. 
Children's Hospital, 261 U. S. 525, 567, 570 (1923) 
(dissenting opinion)]. 

The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, 
Adkins, Burns, and like cases -that due process 
authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when 
they believe the legislature has acted unwisely -has 
long since been discarded. We have returned to the 
original constitutional proposition that courts do not 
substitute their social and economic beliefs for the 
judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass 
laws. As this Court stated in a unanimous opinion in 
1941, -We are not concerned… with the wisdom, 
need, or appropriateness of the legislation. [Olsen v. 
Nebraska ex rel. Western Reference & Bond Assn., 
313 U. S. 236, 246 (1941)]‖ 

Legislative bodies have broad scope to 
experiment with economic problems, and this Court 
does not sit to, -subject the state to an intolerable 
supervision hostile to the basic principles of our 


27 

government and wholly beyond the protection which 
the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was 
intended to secure‖ [Sproles v. Binford, 286 U.S. 374, 
388 (1932)]. It is now settled that States -have power 
to legislate against what are found to be injurious 
practices in their internal commercial and business 
affairs, so long as their laws do not run afoul of some 
specific federal constitutional prohibition, or of some 
valid federal law‖ [Lincoln Federal Labor Union, etc. v. 
Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525, 536 
(1949)]. 

In the face of our abandonment of the use of the 
-vague contours‖ [Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U. 
S. 525, 535 (1923)] of the Due Process Clause to 
nullify laws which a majority of the Court believed to be 
economically unwise, reliance on Adams v. Tanner is 
as mistaken as would be adherence to Adkins v. 
Children's Hospital, overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. 
v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937). Not only has the 
philosophy of Adams been abandoned, but also this 
Court, almost 15 years ago, expressly pointed to 
another opinion of this Court as having -clearly 
undermined‖ Adams. [Lincoln Federal Labor Union, 
etc. v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525 
(1949)]. We conclude that the Kansas Legislature was 
free to decide for itself that legislation was needed to 
deal with the business of debt adjusting. 
Unquestionably, there are arguments showing that the 
business of debt adjusting has social utility, but such 
arguments are properly addressed to the legislature, 
not to us. We refuse to sit as a -superlegislature to 
weigh the wisdom of legislation,‖ [Day-Brite Lighting, 
Inc., v. Missouri, 342 U.S. 421, 423 (1923)] and we 
emphatically refuse to go back to the time when courts 
used the Due Process Clause -to strike down state 
laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, 
because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of 
harmony with a particular school of thought‖ 
[Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 488 


28 

(1955)]. Nor are we able or willing to draw lines by 
calling a law -prohibitory‖ or -regulatory.‖ Whether the 
legislature takes for its textbook Adam Smith, Herbert 
Spencer, Lord Keynes, or some other is no concern of 
ours. The Kansas debt adjusting statute may be wise 
or unwise. But relief, if any be needed, lies not with us, 
but with the body constituted to pass laws for the State 
of Kansas. 

Nor is the statute's exception of lawyers a denial 
of equal protection of the laws to nonlawyers. Statutes 
create many classifications which do not deny equal 
protection; it is only -invidious discrimination‖ which 
offends the Constitution. The business of debt 
adjusting gives rise to a relationship of trust in which 
the debt adjuster will, in a situation of insolvency, be 
marshalling assets in the manner of a proceeding in 
bankruptcy. The debt adjuster's client may need 
advice as to the legality of the various claims against 
him remedies existing under state laws governing 
debtor-creditor relationships, or provisions of the 
Bankruptcy Act -advice which a nonlawyer cannot 
lawfully give him. If the State of Kansas wants to limit 
debt adjusting to lawyers, the Equal Protection Clause 
does not forbid it. We also find no merit in the 
contention that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated 
by the failure of the Kansas statute's title to be as 
specific as appellee thinks it ought to be under the 
Kansas Constitution.‖ 3

In this country, this Court in R.K. Garg v. Union of India, (1981) 

4 SCC 675 has held: 

3 Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 728-733 (1962). 


29 

-8. Another rule of equal importance is that laws 
relating to economic activities should be viewed with 
greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as 
freedom of speech, religion etc. It has been said by no 
less a person than Holmes, J., that the legislature 
should be allowed some play in the joints, because it 
has to deal with complex problems which do not admit 
of solution through any doctrinaire or strait-jacket 
formula and this is particularly true in case of 
legislation dealing with economic matters, where, 
having regard to the nature of the problems required to 
be dealt with, greater play in the joints has to be 
allowed to the legislature. The court should feel more 
inclined to give judicial deference to legislative 
judgment in the field of economic regulation than in 
other areas where fundamental human rights are 
involved. Nowhere has this admonition been more 
felicitously expressed than in Morey v. Doud [351 US 
457 : 1 L Ed 2d 1485 (1957)] where Frankfurter, J., 
said in his inimitable style: 

-In the utilities, tax and economic regulation 
cases, there are good reasons for judicial 
self-restraint if not judicial deference to 
legislative judgment. The legislature after all 
has the affirmative responsibility. The courts 
have only the power to destroy, not to 
reconstruct. When these are added to the 
complexity of economic regulation, the 
uncertainty, the liability to error, the 
bewildering conflict of the experts, and the 
number of times the judges have been 
overruled by events -self-limitation can be 
seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and 
institutional prestige and stability.‖ 

The Court must always remember that -legislation is 
directed to practical problems, that the economic 
mechanism is highly sensitive and complex, that many 
problems are singular and contingent, that laws are 


30 

not abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract 
units and are not to be measured by abstract 
symmetry‖; -that exact wisdom and nice adaption of 
remedy are not always possible‖ and that -judgment is 
largely a prophecy based on meagre and 
uninterpreted 
experience‖. 
Every 
legislation, 
particularly in economic matters is essentially empiric 
and it is based on experimentation or what one may 
call trial and error method and therefore it cannot 
provide for all possible situations or anticipate all 
possible abuses. There may be crudities and 
inequities in complicated experimental economic 
legislation but on that account alone it cannot be 
struck down as invalid. The courts cannot, as pointed 
out by the United States Supreme Court in Secretary 
of Agriculture v. Central Roig Refining Company [94 L 
Ed 381 : 338 US 604 (1950)] be converted into 
tribunals for relief from such crudities and inequities. 
There may even be possibilities of abuse, but that too 
cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the 
legislation, because it is not possible for any 
legislature to anticipate as if by some divine 
prescience, distortions and abuses of its legislation 
which may be made by those subject to its provisions 
and to provide against such distortions and abuses. 
Indeed, howsoever great may be the care bestowed 
on its framing, it is difficult to conceive of a legislation 
which is not capable of being abused by perverted 
human ingenuity. The Court must therefore adjudge 
the constitutionality of such legislation by the 
generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or 
inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its 
provisions. If any crudities, inequities or possibilities of 
abuse come to light, the legislature can always step in 
and enact suitable amendatory legislation. That is the 
essence of pragmatic approach which must guide and 
inspire the legislature in dealing with complex 
economic issues.‖

19. It is true that certain immunities and exemptions 
are granted to persons investing their unaccounted 
money in purchase of Special Bearer Bonds but that is 
an inducement which has to be offered for unearthing 
black money. Those who have successfully evaded 
taxation and concealed their income or wealth despite 
the stringent tax laws and the efforts of the tax 
department are not likely to disclose their unaccounted 
money without some inducement by way of immunities 
and exemptions and it must necessarily be left to the 
legislature to decide what immunities and exemptions 
would be sufficient for the purpose. It would be outside 
the province of the Court to consider if any particular 
immunity or exemption is necessary or not for the 
purpose of inducing disclosure of black money. That 
would depend upon diverse fiscal and economic 
considerations based on practical necessity and 
administrative expediency and would also involve a 
certain amount of experimentation on which the Court 
would be least fitted to pronounce. The Court would 
not have the necessary competence and expertise to 
adjudicate upon such an economic issue. The Court 
cannot possibly assess or evaluate what would be the 
impact of a particular immunity or exemption and 
whether it would serve the purpose in view or not. 
There are so many imponderables that would enter 
into the determination that it would be wise for the 
Court not to hazard an opinion where even economists 
may differ. The Court must while examining the 
constitutional validity of a legislation of this kind, -be 
resilient, not rigid, forward looking, not static, liberal, 
not verbal‖ and the Court must always bear in mind the 
constitutional proposition enunciated by the Supreme 
Court of the United States in Munn v. Illinois [94 US 
13] , namely, -that courts do not substitute their social 
and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative 
bodies‖. The Court must defer to legislative judgment 
in matters relating to social and economic policies and 
must not interfere, unless the exercise of legislative 
judgment appears to be palpably arbitrary. The Court 


32 

should constantly remind itself of what the Supreme 
Court of the United States said in Metropolis Theater 
Company v. City of Chicago [57 L Ed 730 : 228 US 61 
(1912)] : 
-The problems of government are practical 
ones and may justify, if they do not require, 
rough accommodations, illogical it may be, 
and unscientific. But even such criticism 
should not be hastily expressed. What is best 
is not always discernible, the wisdom of any 
choice may be disputed or condemned. Mere 
error of government are not subject to our 
judicial review.‖ 

It is true that one or the other of the immunities or 
exemptions granted under the provisions of the Act 
may be taken advantage of by resourceful persons by 
adopting ingenious methods and devices with a view 
to avoiding or saving tax. But that cannot be helped 
because human ingenuity is so great when it comes to 
tax avoidance that it would be almost impossible to 
frame tax legislation which cannot be abused. 
Moreover, as already pointed out above, the trial and 
error method is inherent in every legislative effort to 
deal with an obstinate social or economic issue and if 
it is found that any immunity or exemption granted 
under the Act is being utilized for tax evasion or 
avoidance not intended by the legislature, the Act can 
always be amended and the abuse terminated. We are 
accordingly of the view that none of the provisions of 
the Act is violative of Article 14 and its constitutional 
validity must be upheld.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

Likewise, in Bhavesh D. Parish v. Union of India, (2000) 5 SCC 471, 

this Court held: 


33 

-26. The services rendered by certain informal sectors 
of the Indian economy could not be belittled. However, 
in the path of economic progress, if the informal 
system was sought to be replaced by a more 
organized system, capable of better regulation and 
discipline, then this was an economic philosophy 
reflected by the legislation in question. Such a 
philosophy might have its merits and demerits. But 
these were matters of economic policy. They are best 
left to the wisdom of the legislature and in policy 
matters the accepted principle is that the courts should 
not interfere. Moreover in the context of the changed 
economic scenario the expertise of people dealing with 
the subject should not be lightly interfered with. The 
consequences of such interdiction can have large-
scale ramifications and can put the clock back for a 
number of years. The process of rationalization of the 
infirmities in the economy can be put in serious 
jeopardy and, therefore, it is necessary that while 
dealing with economic legislations, this Court, while 
not jettisoning its jurisdiction to curb arbitrary action or 
unconstitutional legislation, should interfere only in 
those few cases where the view reflected in the 
legislation is not possible to be taken at all.‖ 

xxx xxx xxx 

-30. Before we conclude there is another matter which 
we must advert to. It has been brought to our notice 
that Section 45-S of the Act has been challenged in 
various High Courts and a few of them have granted 
the stay of provisions of Section 45-S. When 
considering an application for staying the operation of 
a piece of legislation, and that too pertaining to 
economic reform or change, then the courts must bear 
in mind that unless the provision is manifestly unjust or 
glaringly unconstitutional, the courts must show judicial 
restraint in staying the applicability of the same. Merely 
because a statute comes up for examination and some 
arguable point is raised, which persuades the courts to 


34 

consider the controversy, the legislative will should not 
normally be put under suspension pending such 
consideration. It is now well settled that there is always 
a presumption in favour of the constitutional validity of 
any legislation, unless the same is set aside after final 
hearing and, therefore, the tendency to grant stay of 
legislation relating to economic reform, at the interim 
stage, cannot be understood. The system of checks 
and balances has to be utilized in a balanced manner 
with the primary objective of accelerating economic 
growth rather than suspending its growth by doubting 
its constitutional efficacy at the threshold itself.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

In DG of Foreign Trade v. Kanak Exports, (2016) 2 SCC 226, this 

Court has held: 

-109. Therefore, it cannot be denied that the 
Government has a right to amend, modify or even 
rescind a particular scheme. It is well settled that in 
complex economic matters every decision is 
necessarily empiric and it is based on experimentation 
or what one may call trial and error method and 
therefore, its validity cannot be tested on any rigid prior 
considerations or on the application of any straitjacket 
formula. In Balco Employees' Union v. Union of India 
[Balco Employees' Union v. Union of India, (2002) 2 
SCC 333], the Supreme Court held that laws, including 
executive action relating to economic activities should 
be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil 
rights such as freedom of speech, religion, etc. that the 
legislature should be allowed some play in the joints 
because it has to deal with complex problems which 
do not admit of solution through any doctrine or 
straitjacket formula and this is particularly true in case 
of legislation dealing with economic matters, where 
having regard to the nature of the problems greater 
latitude require to be allowed to the legislature……‖ 


35 

It is with this background, factual and legal, that the constitutional 

validity of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 has to be 

viewed. 

THE RAISON D'ÊTRE FOR THE INSOLVENCY AND BANKRUPTCY CODE 

9. 
The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Code have been 

referred to in Innoventive Industries (supra) which states: 

-12. ……The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 
Code reads as under: 

-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-There is no 
single law in India that deals with insolvency and 
bankruptcy. Provisions relating to insolvency and 
bankruptcy for companies can be found in the Sick 
Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, 
the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial 
Institutions Act, 1993, the Securitisation and 
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement 
of Security Interest Act, 2002 and the Companies Act, 
2013. These statutes provide for creation of multiple 
fora such as Board of Industrial and Financial 
Reconstruction (BIFR), Debts Recovery Tribunal 
(DRT) and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) 
and their respective Appellate Tribunals. Liquidation of 
companies is handled by the High Courts. Individual 
bankruptcy and insolvency is dealt with under the 
Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909, and the 
Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 and is dealt with by the 
Courts. The existing framework for insolvency and 
bankruptcy is inadequate, ineffective and results in 
undue delays in resolution, therefore, the proposed 
legislation. 


36 

2. The objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code, 2015 is to consolidate and amend the laws 
relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution of 
corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in 
a time-bound manner for maximization of value of 
assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, 
availability of credit and balance the interests of all the 
stakeholders including alteration in the priority of 
payment of government dues and to establish an 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Fund, and matters 
connected therewith or incidental thereto. An effective 
legal framework for timely resolution of insolvency and 
bankruptcy would support development of credit 
markets and encourage entrepreneurship. It would 
also improve Ease of Doing Business, and facilitate 
more investments leading to higher economic growth 
and development. 

3. The Code seeks to provide for designating NCLT 
and DRT as the Adjudicating Authorities for corporate 
persons and firms and individuals, respectively, for 
resolution of insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy. 
The Code separates commercial aspects of insolvency 
and bankruptcy proceedings from judicial aspects. The 
Code also seeks to provide for establishment of the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Board) for 
regulation of insolvency professionals, insolvency 
professional agencies and information utilities. Till the 
Board is established, the Central Government shall 
exercise all powers of the Board or designate any 
financial sector regulator to exercise the powers and 
functions of the Board. Insolvency professionals will 
assist in completion of insolvency resolution, 
liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings envisaged in 
the Code. Information Utilities would collect, collate, 
authenticate and disseminate financial information to 
facilitate such proceedings. The Code also proposes 
to establish a fund to be called the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Fund of India for the purposes specified in 
the Code. 


37 

4. The Code seeks to provide for amendments in the 
Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Central Excise Act, 
1944, Customs Act, 1962, the Income Tax Act, 1961, 
the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial 
Institutions Act, 1993, the Finance Act, 1994, the 
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets 
and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, the 
Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal 
Act, 2003, the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 
2007, the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, and 
the Companies Act, 2013. 

5. The Code seeks to achieve the above objectives.‖ 
(emphasis in original) 

10. The Preamble of the Code states as follows: 

-An Act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to 
reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate 
persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time-
bound manner for maximization of value of assets of 
such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability 
of credit and balance the interests of all the 
stakeholders including alteration in the order of priority 
of payment of Government dues and to establish an 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, and for 
matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.‖ 

11. As is discernible, the Preamble gives an insight into what is 

sought to be achieved by the Code. The Code is first and foremost, a 

Code for reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate debtors. 

Unless such reorganization is effected in a time-bound manner, the 

value of the assets of such persons will deplete. Therefore, 


38 

maximization of value of the assets of such persons so that they are 

efficiently run as going concerns is another very important objective of 

the Code. This, in turn, will promote entrepreneurship as the persons in 

management of the corporate debtor are removed and replaced by 

entrepreneurs. When, therefore, a resolution plan takes off and the 

corporate debtor is brought back into the economic mainstream, it is 

able to repay its debts, which, in turn, enhances the viability of credit in 

the hands of banks and financial institutions. Above all, ultimately, the 

interests of all stakeholders are looked after as the corporate debtor 

itself becomes a beneficiary of the resolution scheme -workers are 

paid, the creditors in the long run will be repaid in full, and 

shareholders/investors are able to maximize their investment. Timely 

resolution of a corporate debtor who is in the red, by an effective legal 

framework, would go a long way to support the development of credit 

markets. Since more investment can be made with funds that have 

come back into the economy, business then eases up, which leads, 

overall, to higher economic growth and development of the Indian 

economy. What is interesting to note is that the Preamble does not, in 

any manner, refer to liquidation, which is only availed of as a last resort 

if there is either no resolution plan or the resolution plans submitted are 


39 

not up to the mark. Even in liquidation, the liquidator can sell the 

business of the corporate debtor as a going concern. [See 

ArcelorMittal (supra) at paragraph 83, footnote 3]. 

12. It can thus be seen that the primary focus of the legislation is to 

ensure revival and continuation of the corporate debtor by protecting 

the corporate debtor from its own management and from a corporate 

death by liquidation. The Code is thus a beneficial legislation which 

puts the corporate debtor back on its feet, not being a mere recovery 

legislation for creditors. The interests of the corporate debtor have, 

therefore, been bifurcated and separated from that of its promoters / 

those who are in management. Thus, the resolution process is not 

adversarial to the corporate debtor but, in fact, protective of its 

interests. The moratorium imposed by Section 14 is in the interest of 

the corporate debtor itself, thereby preserving the assets of the 

corporate debtor during the resolution process. The timelines within 

which the resolution process is to take place again protects the 

corporate debtor's assets from further dilution, and also protects all its 

creditors and workers by seeing that the resolution process goes 

through as fast as possible so that another management can, through 


40 

its entrepreneurial skills, resuscitate the corporate debtor to achieve all 

these ends. 

APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS OF THE NCLT AND THE NCLAT NOT CONTRARY 

TO THIS COURT'S JUDGMENTS. 

13. Shri Rohatgi has argued that contrary to the judgments in 

Madras Bar Association (I) (supra) and Madras Bar Association (III) 

(supra), Section 412(2) of the Companies Act, 2013 continued on the 

statute book, as a result of which, the two Judicial Members of the 

Selection Committee get outweighed by three bureaucrats. 

14. On 03.01.2018, the Companies Amendment Act, 2017 was 

brought into force by which Section 412 of the Companies Act, 2013 

was amended as follows: 

-412. Selection of Members of Tribunal and 
Appellate Tribunal.-
xxx xxx xxx 
(2) The Members of the Tribunal and the 
Technical Members of the Appellate Tribunal shall 
be appointed on the recommendation of a 
Selection Committee consisting of-
(a) Chief Justice of India or his nominee-
Chairperson; 
(b) a senior Judge of the Supreme Court or 
Chief Justice of High Court-Member; 
(c) Secretary in the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs-Member; and 


41 

(d) Secretary in the Ministry of Law and 
Justice-Member. 
(2-A) Where in a meeting of the Selection 
Committee, there is equality of votes on any 
matter, the Chairperson shall have a casting 
vote.‖ 

This was brought into force by a notification dated 09.02.2018. 

However, an additional affidavit has been filed during the course of 

these proceedings by the Union of India. This affidavit is filed by one 

Dr. Raj Singh, Regional Director (Northern Region) of the Ministry of 

Corporate Affairs. This affidavit makes it clear that, acting in 

compliance with the directions of the Supreme Court in the aforesaid 

judgments, a Selection Committee was constituted to make 

appointments of Members of the NCLT in the year 2015 itself. Thus, by 

an Order dated 27.07.2015, (i) Justice Gogoi (as he then was), (ii) 

Justice Ramana, (iii) Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of 

Law and Justice, and (iv) Secretary, Corporate Affairs, were 

constituted as the Selection Committee. This Selection Committee was 

reconstituted on 22.02.2017 to make further appointments. In 

compliance of the directions of this Court, advertisements dated 

10.08.2015 were issued inviting applications for Judicial and Technical 

Members as a result of which, all the present Members of the NCLT 


42 

and NCLAT have been appointed. This being the case, we need not 

detain ourselves any further with regard to the first submission of Shri 

Rohatgi. 

NCLAT BENCH ONLY AT DELHI. 

15. It has been argued by Shri Rohatgi that as per our judgment in 

Madras Bar Association (II) (supra), paragraph 123 states as follows: 

-123. We shall first examine the validity of Section 5 of 
the NTT Act. The basis of challenge to the above 
provision has already been narrated by us while 
dealing with the submissions advanced on behalf of 
the petitioners with reference to the fourth contention. 
According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, 
Section 5(2) of the NTT Act mandates that NTT would 
ordinarily have its sittings in the National Capital 
Territory of Delhi. According to the petitioners, the 
aforesaid mandate would deprive the litigating 
assessee the convenience of approaching the 
jurisdictional High Court in the State to which he 
belongs. An assessee may belong to a distant/remote 
State, in which eventuality, he would not merely have 
to suffer the hardship of travelling a long distance, but 
such travel would also entail uncalled for financial 
expense. Likewise, a litigant assessee from a far-flung 
State may find it extremely difficult and inconvenient to 
identify an Advocate who would represent him before 
NTT, since the same is mandated to be ordinarily 
located in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Even 
though we have expressed the view, that it is open to 
Parliament to substitute the appellate jurisdiction 
vested in the jurisdictional High Courts and constitute 
courts/tribunals to exercise the said jurisdiction, we are 
of the view, that while vesting jurisdiction in an 


43 

alternative court/tribunal, it is imperative for the 
legislature to ensure that redress should be available 
with the same convenience and expediency as it was 
prior to the introduction of the newly created 
court/tribunal. Thus viewed, the mandate incorporated 
in Section 5(2) of the NTT Act to the effect that the 
sittings of NTT would ordinarily be conducted in the 
National Capital Territory of Delhi, would render the 
remedy inefficacious, and thus unacceptable in law. 
The instant aspect of the matter was considered by 
this Court with reference to the Administrative 
Tribunals Act, 1985 in S.P. Sampath Kumar case [S.P. 
Sampath Kumar v. Union of India, (1987) 1 SCC 124 : 
(1987) 2 ATC 82] and L. Chandra Kumar case [L. 
Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261 : 
1997 SCC (L&S) 577], wherein it was held that 
permanent Benches needed to be established at the 
seat of every jurisdictional High Court. And if that was 
not possible, at least a Circuit Bench required to be 
established at every place where an aggrieved party 
could avail of his remedy. The position on the above 
issue is no different in the present controversy. For the 
above reason, Section 5(2) of the NTT Act is in clear 
breach of the law declared by this Court.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

16. The learned Attorney General has assured us that this judgment 

will be followed and Circuit Benches will be established as soon as it is 

practicable. In this view of the matter, we record this submission and 

direct the Union of India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within 

a period of 6 months from today. 

THE TRIBUNALS ARE FUNCTIONING UNDER THE WRONG MINISTRY 


44 

17. Shri Mukul Rohatgi argued that in Madras Bar Association (I) 

(supra), paragraph 120(xii) specifically reads as follows: 

-120 We may tabulate the corrections required to set 
right the defects in Parts I-B and I-C of the Act: 
xxx xxx xxx 
(xii) The administrative support for all Tribunals 
should be from the Ministry of Law and Justice. 
Neither the Tribunals nor their members shall 
seek or be provided with facilities from the 
respective sponsoring or parent Ministries or 
Department concerned. 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 

Even though eight years have passed since the date of this judgment, 

the administrative support for these tribunals continues to be from the 

Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This needs to be rectified at the earliest. 

18. However, the learned Attorney General pointed out Article 77(3) 

of the Constitution of India and Delhi International Airport Limited v. 

International Lease Finance Corporation and Ors., (2015) 8 SCC 

446, which state that once rules of business are allocated among 

various Ministries, such allocation is mandatory in nature. According to 

him, therefore, the rules of business, having allocated matters which 

arise under the Insolvency Code to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 

are mandatory in nature and have to be followed. 


45 

19. It is obvious that the rules of business, being mandatory in 

nature, and having to be followed, are to be so followed by the 

executive branch of the Government. As far as we are concerned, we 

are bound by the Constitution Bench judgment in Madras Bar 

Association (I) (supra). This statement of the law has been made 

eight years ago. It is high time that the Union of India follow, both in 

letter and spirit, the judgment of this Court. 

CLASSIFICATION BETWEEN FINANCIAL CREDITOR AND OPERATIONAL 

CREDITOR NEITHER DISCRIMINATORY, NOR ARBITRARY, NOR VIOLATIVE OF 

ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA. 

20. The tests for violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, 

when legislation is challenged as being violative of the principle of 

equality, have been settled by this Court time and again. Since equality 

is only among equals, no discrimination results if the Court can be 

shown that there is an intelligible differentia which separates two kinds 

of creditors so long as there is some rational relation between the 

creditors so differentiated, with the object sought to be achieved by the 

legislation. This aspect of Article 14 has been laid down in judgments 

too numerous to cite, from the very inception. 


46 

21. Another development of the law is that legislation can be struck 

down as being manifestly arbitrary. This has been laid down by the 

recent Constitution Bench decision in Shayara Bano (supra) as 

follows: 

-95. On a reading of this judgment in Natural 
Resources Allocation case [Natural Resources 
Allocation, In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 2012, 
(2012) 10 SCC 1], it is clear that this Court did not 
read McDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co., 
(1996) 3 SCC 709] as being an authority for the 
proposition that legislation can never be struck down 
as being arbitrary. Indeed the Court, after referring to 
all the earlier judgments, and Ajay Hasia [Ajay Hasia v. 
Khalid Mujib Sehravardi, (1981) 1 SCC 722 : 1981 
SCC (L&S) 258] in particular, which stated that 
legislation can be struck down on the ground that it is 
-arbitrary‖ under Article 14, went on to conclude that 
-arbitrariness‖ when applied to legislation cannot be 
used loosely. Instead, it broad based the test, stating 
that if a constitutional infirmity is found, Article 14 will 
interdict such infirmity. And a constitutional infirmity is 
found in Article 14 itself whenever legislation is 
-manifestly arbitrary‖ i.e. when it is not fair, not 
reasonable, discriminatory, not transparent, capricious, 
biased, with favouritism or nepotism and not in pursuit 
of promotion of healthy competition and equitable 
treatment. Positively speaking, it should conform to 
norms which are rational, informed with reason and 
guided by public interest, etc. 

96. Another 
Constitution 
Bench 
decision 
in 
Subramanian Swamy v. CBI [Subramanian Swamy v. 
CBI, (2014) 8 SCC 682 : (2014) 6 SCC (Cri) 42 : 
(2014) 3 SCC (L&S) 36] dealt with a challenge to 
Section 6-A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment 
Act, 1946. This section was ultimately struck down as 


47 

being discriminatory and hence violative of Article 14. 
A specific reference had been made to the 
Constitution Bench by the reference order in 
Subramanian Swamy v. CBI [Subramanian Swamy v. 
CBI, (2005) 2 SCC 317 : 2005 SCC (L&S) 241] and 
after referring to several judgments including Ajay 
Hasia [Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi, (1981) 1 
SCC 722 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 258], Mardia Chemicals 
[Mardia Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India, (2004) 4 
SCC 311], Malpe Vishwanath Acharya [Malpe 
Vishwanath Acharya v. State of Maharashtra, (1998) 2 
SCC 1] and McDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell and 
Co., (1996) 3 SCC 709], the reference, inter alia, was 
as to whether arbitrariness and unreasonableness, 
being facets of Article 14, are or are not available as 
grounds to invalidate a legislation. 

97. After referring to the submissions of the counsel, 
and several judgments on the discrimination aspect of 
Article 14, this Court held: (Subramanian Swamy case 
[Subramanian Swamy v. CBI, (2014) 8 SCC 682 : 
(2014) 6 SCC (Cri) 42 : (2014) 3 SCC (L&S) 36] , SCC 
pp. 721-22, paras 48-49) 
-48. In E.P. Royappa [E.P. Royappa v. State of 
T.N., (1974) 4 SCC 3 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 165] , it 
has been held by this Court that the basic 
principle which informs both Articles 14 and 16 
are equality and inhibition against discrimination. 
This Court observed in para 85 as under: (SCC p. 
38) 
‗85. … From a positivistic point of view, 
equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact 
equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; 
one belongs to the rule of law in a republic 
while the other, to the whim and caprice of an 
absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, 
it is implicit in it that it is unequal both 
according to political logic and constitutional 
law and is therefore violative of Article 14, 
and if it affects any matter relating to public 


48 

employment, it is also violative of Article 16. 
Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in 
State action and ensure fairness and equality 
of treatment.' 

Court's approach 

49. Where there is challenge to the constitutional 
validity of a law enacted by the legislature, the 
Court must keep in view that there is always a 
presumption of constitutionality of an enactment, 
and a clear transgression of constitutional 
principles must be shown. The fundamental 
nature and importance of the legislative process 
needs to be recognised by the Court and due 
regard and deference must be accorded to the 
legislative process. Where the legislation is 
sought to be challenged as being unconstitutional 
and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, the 
Court must remind itself to the principles relating 
to the applicability of Article 14 in relation to 
invalidation of legislation. The two dimensions of 
Article 14 in its application to legislation and 
rendering legislation invalid are now well 
recognised and these are: (i) discrimination, 
based on an impermissible or invalid 
classification, and (ii) excessive delegation of 
powers; conferment of uncanalised and unguided 
powers on the executive, whether in the form of 
delegated legislation or by way of conferment of 
authority to pass administrative orders-if such 
conferment is without any guidance, control or 
checks, it is violative of Article 14 of the 
Constitution. The Court also needs to be mindful 
that 
a 
legislation 
does 
not 
become 
unconstitutional merely because there is another 
view or because another method may be 
considered to be as good or even more effective, 
like any issue of social, or even economic policy. 
It is well settled that the courts do not substitute 
their views on what the policy is.‖ 


49 

xxx xxx xxx 

100. To complete the picture, it is important to note 
that subordinate legislation can be struck down on the 
ground that it is arbitrary and, therefore, violative of 
Article 14 of the Constitution. In Cellular Operators 
Assn. of India v. TRAI [Cellular Operators Assn. of 
India v. TRAI, (2016) 7 SCC 703], this Court referred 
to earlier precedents, and held: (SCC pp. 736-37, 
paras 42-44) 

-Violation of fundamental rights 
42. We have already seen that one of the tests for 
challenging the constitutionality of subordinate 
legislation is that subordinate legislation should 
not be manifestly arbitrary. Also, it is settled law 
that subordinate legislation can be challenged on 
any of the grounds available for challenge against 
plenary legislation. [See Indian Express 
Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. Union of India 
[Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. 
Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641 : 1985 SCC 
(Tax) 121] , SCC at p. 689, para 75.] 
43. The test of -manifest arbitrariness‖ is well 
explained in two judgments of this Court. In 
Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka 
[Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, 
(1996) 10 SCC 304], this Court held: (SCC p. 314, 
para 13) 
‗13. It is next submitted before us that the 
amended Rules are arbitrary, unreasonable 
and cause undue hardship and, therefore, 
violate Article 14 of the Constitution. Although 
the protection of Article 19(1)(g) may not be 
available to the appellants, the Rules must, 
undoubtedly, satisfy the test of Article 14, 
which is a guarantee against arbitrary action. 
However, one must bear in mind that what is 
being challenged here under Article 14 is not 
executive action but delegated legislation. 


50 

The tests of arbitrary action which apply to 
executive actions do not necessarily apply to 
delegated legislation. In order that delegated 
legislation can be struck down, such 
legislation must be manifestly arbitrary; a law 
which could not be reasonably expected to 
emanate from an authority delegated with the 
law-making power. In Indian Express 
Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. Union of 
India [Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) 
(P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641 : 
1985 SCC (Tax) 121], this Court said that a 
piece of subordinate legislation does not 
carry the same degree of immunity which is 
enjoyed by a statute passed by a competent 
legislature. A subordinate legislation may be 
questioned under Article 14 on the ground 
that it is unreasonable; "unreasonable not in 
the sense of not being reasonable, but in the 
sense that it is manifestly arbitrary‖. Drawing 
a comparison between the law in England 
and in India, the Court further observed that 
in England the Judges would say, 
-Parliament never intended the authority to 
make such rules; they are unreasonable and 
ultra vires‖. In India, arbitrariness is not a 
separate ground since it will come within the 
embargo of Article 14 of the Constitution. But 
subordinate legislation must be so arbitrary 
that it could not be said to be in conformity 
with the statute or that it offends Article 14 of 
the Constitution.' 
44. Also, in Sharma Transport v. State of A.P. 
[Sharma Transport v. State of A.P., (2002) 2 SCC 
188], this Court held: (SCC pp. 203-04, para 25) 
‗25. … The tests of arbitrary action applicable 
to executive action do not necessarily apply 
to delegated legislation. In order to strike 
down a delegated legislation as arbitrary it 
has to be established that there is manifest 


51 

arbitrariness. In order to be described as 
arbitrary, it must be shown that it was not 
reasonable and manifestly arbitrary. The 
expression -arbitrarily‖ means: in an 
unreasonable manner, as fixed or done 
capriciously or at pleasure, without adequate 
determining principle, not founded in the 
nature of things, non-rational, not done or 
acting according to reason or judgment, 
depending on the will alone.'‖ 
(emphasis in original) 

101. It will be noticed that a Constitution Bench of this 
Court in Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) (P) 
Ltd. v. Union of India [Indian Express Newspapers 
(Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641 
: 1985 SCC (Tax) 121] stated that it was settled law 
that subordinate legislation can be challenged on any 
of the grounds available for challenge against plenary 
legislation. This being the case, there is no rational 
distinction between the two types of legislation when it 
comes to this ground of challenge under Article 14. 
The test of manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as laid 
down in the aforesaid judgments would apply to 
invalidate legislation as well as subordinate legislation 
under Article 14. Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, 
must be something done by the legislature 
capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate 
determining principle. Also, when something is done 
which is excessive and disproportionate, such 
legislation would be manifestly arbitrary. We are, 
therefore, of the view that arbitrariness in the sense of 
manifest arbitrariness as pointed out by us above 
would apply to negate legislation as well under Article 
14.‖ 

This judgment has since been followed in Gopal Jha v. The Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of India, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 745/2018 [decided 


52 

on 25.10.2018] (at paragraph 27); Indian Young Lawyers 

Associations and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Ors., Writ Petition 

(Civil) No. 373/2006 [decided on 28.09.2018]; Joseph Shine v. Union

Section 7 of the Code states: 

-7. Initiation of corporate insolvency resolution 
process by financial creditor.-(1) A financial 
creditor either by itself or jointly with other financial 
creditors, or any other person on behalf of the financial 
creditor, as may be notified by the Central 
Government, may file an application for initiating 
corporate insolvency resolution process against a 
corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority 
when a default has occurred. 
Explanation.-For the purposes of this sub-section, 
a default includes a default in respect of a financial 


55 

debt owed not only to the applicant financial creditor 
but to any other financial creditor of the corporate 
debtor. 
(2) The financial creditor shall make an application 
under sub-section (1) in such form and manner and 
accompanied with such fee as may be prescribed. 

(3) The financial creditor shall, along with the 
application furnish-
(a) record of the default recorded with the 
information utility or such other record or 
evidence of default as may be specified; 
(b) the name of the resolution professional 
proposed to act as an interim resolution 
professional; and 
(c) any other information as may be specified by 
the Board. 
(4) The Adjudicating Authority shall, within fourteen 
days of the receipt of the application under sub-section 
(2), ascertain the existence of a default from the 
records of an information utility or on the basis of other 
evidence furnished by the financial creditor under sub-
section (3). 
(5) Where the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that-
(a) a default has occurred and the application 
under sub-section (2) is complete, and there is no 
disciplinary proceedings pending against the 
proposed resolution professional, it may, by order, 
admit such application; or 
(b) default has not occurred or the application 
under sub-section (2) is incomplete or any 
disciplinary proceeding is pending against the 
proposed resolution professional, it may, by order, 
reject such application: 
Provided that the Adjudicating Authority shall, 
before rejecting the application under clause (b) of 
sub-section (5), give a notice to the applicant to 
rectify the defect in his application within seven 
days of receipt of such notice from the 
Adjudicating Authority. 


56 

(6) The corporate insolvency resolution process shall 
commence from the date of admission of the 
application under sub-section (5). 

(7) The Adjudicating Authority shall communicate-

(a) the order under clause (a) of sub-section (5) to 
the financial creditor and the corporate debtor; 
(b) the order under clause (b) of sub-section (5) to 
the financial creditor, within seven days of 
admission or rejection of such application, as the 
case may be.‖ 

23. A perusal of the definition of -financial creditor‖ and -financial 

debt‖ makes it clear that a financial debt is a debt together with 

interest, if any, which is disbursed against the consideration for time 

value of money. It may further be money that is borrowed or raised in 

any of the manners prescribed in Section 5(8) or otherwise, as Section 

5(8) is an inclusive definition. On the other hand, an -operational debt‖ 

would include a claim in respect of the provision of goods or services, 

including employment, or a debt in respect of payment of dues arising 

under any law and payable to the Government or any local authority. 

24. A financial creditor may trigger the Code either by itself or jointly 

with other financial creditors or such persons as may be notified by the 

Central Government when a -default‖ occurs. The Explanation to 

Section 7(1) also makes it clear that the Code may be triggered by 

such persons in respect of a default made to any other financial 


57 

creditor of the corporate debtor, making it clear that once triggered, the 

resolution process under the Code is a collective proceeding in rem 

which seeks, in the first instance, to rehabilitate the corporate debtor. 

Under Section 7(4), the Adjudicating Authority shall, within the 

prescribed period, ascertain the existence of a default on the basis of 

evidence furnished by the financial creditor; and under Section 7(5), 

the Adjudicating Authority has to be satisfied that a default has 

occurred, when it may, by order, admit the application, or dismiss the 

application if such default has not occurred. On the other hand, under 

Sections 8 and 9, an operational creditor may, on the occurrence of a 

default, deliver a demand notice which must then be replied to within 

the specified period. What is important is that at this stage, if an 

application is filed before the Adjudicating Authority for initiating the 

corporate insolvency resolution process, the corporate debtor can 

prove that the debt is disputed. When the debt is so disputed, such 

application would be rejected. 

25. The argument of learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners is 

that in point of fact, there is no intelligible differentia having relation to 

the objects sought to be achieved by the Code between financial and 

operational creditors and indeed, nowhere in the world has this 


58 

distinction been made. The BLRC Report presents what according to it 

is the rationale for the reason to differentiate between financial and 

operational creditors. The Report states as follows: 

-While both types of creditors can trigger the IRP 
under the Code, the evidence presented to trigger 
varies. Since financial creditors have electronic 
records of the liabilities filed in the Information Utilities 
of Section 4.3, incontrovertible event of default on any 
financial credit contract can be readily verifiable by 
accessing this system. The evidence submitted of 
default by the debtor to the operational creditor may be 
in either electronic or physical form, since all 
operational creditors may or may not have electronic 
filings of the debtors' liability. Till such time that the 
Information Utilities are ubiquitous, financial creditors 
may establish default in a manner similar to 
operational creditors.‖ 

Similarly, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill in the Notes on Clause 8 

states: 

-Clause 8 lays down the procedure for the initiation of 
the corporate insolvency resolution process by an 
operational creditor. This procedure differs from the 
procedure applicable to financial creditors as 
operational debts (such as trade debts, salary or wage 
claims) tend to be small amounts (in comparison to 
financial debts) or are recurring in nature and may not 
be accurately reflected on the records of information 
utilities at all times. The possibility of disputed debts in 
relation to operational creditors is also higher in 
comparison to financial creditors such as banks and 
financial institutions. Accordingly, the process for 
initiation of the insolvency resolution process differs for 
an operational creditor…… This ensures that 


59 

operational creditors, whose debt claims are usually 
smaller, are not able to put the corporate debtor into 
the insolvency resolution process prematurely or 
initiate the process for extraneous considerations. It 
may also facilitate informal negotiations between such 
creditors and the corporate debtor, which may result in 
a restructuring of the debt outside the formal 
proceedings.‖ 

However, the Insolvency Law Committee [-ILC‖], in its Report of March 

2018 dealt with debenture holders and fixed deposit holders, who are 

also financial creditors, and are numerous. The Report then went on to 

state: 

-10.6 For certain securities, a trustee or an agent may 
already be appointed as per the terms of the security 
instrument. For example, a debenture trustee would be 
appointed if debentures exceeding 500 have been 
issued [Section 71(5), Companies Act, 2013] or if 
secured debentures are issued [Rule 18(1)(c), 
Companies (Share Capital and Debenture) Rules, 
2014]. Such creditors may be represented through 
such pre-appointed trustees or agents. For other 
classes of creditors which exceed a certain threshold 
in number, like home buyers or security holders for 
whom no trustee or agent has already been appointed 
under a debt instrument or otherwise, an insolvency 
professional (other than the IRP) shall be appointed by 
the NCLT on the request of the IRP. It is to be noted 
that as the agent or trustee or insolvency professional, 
i.e. the authorised representative for the creditors 
discussed above and executors, guarantors, etc. as 
discussed in paragraph 9 of this Report, shall be a part 
of the CoC, they cannot be related parties to the 
corporate debtor in line with the spirit of proviso to 
section 21(2).‖ 


60 

xxx xxx xxx 

-10.8 In light of the deliberation above, the Committee 
felt that a mechanism requires to be provided in the 
Code to mandate representation in meetings of 
security holders, deposit holders, and all other classes 
of financial creditors which exceed a certain number, 
through an authorised representative. This can be 
done by adding a new provision to section 21 of the 
Code. Such a representative may either be a trustee 
or an agent appointed under the terms of the debt 
agreement of such creditors, otherwise an insolvency 
professional may be appointed by the NCLT for each 
such class of financial creditors. Additionally, the 
representative shall act and attend the meetings on 
behalf of the respective class of financial creditors and 
shall vote on behalf of each of the financial creditor to 
the extent of the voting share of each such creditor, 
and as per their instructions. To ensure adequate 
representation by the authorised representative of the 
financial creditors, a specific provision laying down the 
rights and duties of such authorised representatives 
may be inserted. Further, the requisite threshold for 
the number of creditors and manner of voting may be 
specified by IBBI through regulations to enable 
efficient voting by the representative. Also, regulation 
25 may also be amended to enable voting through 
electronic means such as e-mail, to address any 
technical issues which may arise due to a large 
number of creditors voting at the same time.‖ 

Given this Report, the Code was amended and Section 21(6A) and 

21(6B) were added, which are set out hereinbelow: 

-21. Committee of creditors.-

xxx xxx xxx 

(6-A) Where a financial debt-


61 

(a) is in the form of securities or deposits and the 
terms of the financial debt provide for appointment 
of a trustee or agent to act as authorised 
representative for all the financial creditors, such 
trustee or agent shall act on behalf of such 
financial creditors; 

(b) is owed to a class of creditors exceeding the 
number as may be specified, other than the 
creditors covered under clause (a) or sub-section 
(6), the interim resolution professional shall make 
an application to the Adjudicating Authority along 
with the list of all financial creditors, containing the 
name of an insolvency professional, other than 
the interim resolution professional, to act as their 
authorised representative who shall be appointed 
by the Adjudicating Authority prior to the first 
meeting of the committee of creditors; 

(c) is represented by a guardian, executor or 
administrator, such person shall act as authorised 
representative on behalf of such financial 
creditors, 

and such authorised representative under clause (a) or 
clause (b) or clause (c) shall attend the meetings of the 
committee of creditors, and vote on behalf of each 
financial creditor to the extent of his voting share. 

(6-B) The remuneration payable to the authorised 
representative-
(i) under clauses (a) and (c) of sub-section (6-A), 
if any, shall be as per the terms of the financial 
debt or the relevant documentation; and 

(ii) under clause (b) of sub-section (6-A) shall be 
as specified which shall form part of the 
insolvency resolution process costs.‖ 

Also, Regulations 16A and 16B of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 

Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) 


62 

Regulations, 2016 [-CIRP Regulations‖] were added, with effect from 

04.07.2018, as follows:

Form CA received under sub-regulation (2) of 
regulation 12 shall not be considered. 

(2) The interim resolution professional shall apply to 
the Adjudicating Authority for appointment of the

(9) The authorised representative shall circulate the 
agenda to creditors in a class and announce the voting 
window at least twenty-four hours before the window 
opens for voting instructions and keep the voting 
window open for at least twelve hours. 

16B. Committee with only creditors in a class.-
Where the corporate debtor has only creditors in a 
class and no other financial creditor eligible to join the 
committee, the committee shall consist of only the 
authorised representative(s).‖ 

26. It is obvious that debenture holders and persons with home 

loans may be numerous and, therefore, have been statutorily dealt 

with by the aforesaid change made in the Code as well as the 


64 

Regulations. However, as a general rule, it is correct to say that 

financial creditors, which involve banks and financial institutions, would 

certainly be smaller in number than operational creditors of a corporate 

debtor. 

27. According to us, it is clear that most financial creditors, 

particularly banks and financial institutions, are secured creditors 

whereas most operational creditors are unsecured, payments for 

goods and services as well as payments to workers not being secured 

by mortgaged documents and the like. The distinction between 

secured and unsecured creditors is a distinction which has obtained 

since the earliest of the Companies Acts both in the United Kingdom 

and in this country. Apart from the above, the nature of loan 

agreements with financial creditors is different from contracts with 

operational creditors for supplying goods and services. Financial 

creditors generally lend finance on a term loan or for working capital 

that enables the corporate debtor to either set up and/or operate its 

business. On the other hand, contracts with operational creditors are 

relatable to supply of goods and services in the operation of business. 

Financial contracts generally involve large sums of money. By way of 

contrast, operational contracts have dues whose quantum is generally 


65 

less. In the running of a business, operational creditors can be many 

as opposed to financial creditors, who lend finance for the set up or 

working of business. Also, financial creditors have specified repayment 

schedules, and defaults entitle financial creditors to recall a loan in 

totality. Contracts with operational creditors do not have any such 

stipulations. Also, the forum in which dispute resolution takes place is 

completely different. Contracts with operational creditors can and do 

have arbitration clauses where dispute resolution is done privately. 

Operational debts also tend to be recurring in nature and the possibility 

of genuine disputes in case of operational debts is much higher when 

compared to financial debts. A simple example will suffice. Goods that 

are supplied may be substandard. Services that are provided may be 

substandard. Goods may not have been supplied at all. All these qua 

operational debts are matters to be proved in arbitration or in the 

courts of law. On the other hand, financial debts made to banks and 

financial institutions are well-documented and defaults made are easily 

verifiable. 

28. Most importantly, financial creditors are, from the very beginning, 

involved with assessing the viability of the corporate debtor. They can, 

and therefore do, engage in restructuring of the loan as well as 


66 

reorganization of the corporate debtor's business when there is 

financial stress, which are things operational creditors do not and 

cannot do. Thus, preserving the corporate debtor as a going concern, 

while ensuring maximum recovery for all creditors being the objective 

of the Code, financial creditors are clearly different from operational 

creditors and therefore, there is obviously an intelligible differentia 

between the two which has a direct relation to the objects sought to be 

achieved by the Code. 

NOTICE, HEARING, AND SET-OFF OR COUNTERCLAIM QUA FINANCIAL DEBTS. 

29. This Court, in Innoventive Industries (supra) stated as follows: 

-27. The scheme of the Code is to ensure that when a 
default takes place, in the sense that a debt becomes 
due and is not paid, the insolvency resolution process 
begins. Default is defined in Section 3(12) in very wide 
terms as meaning non-payment of a debt once it 
becomes due and payable, which includes non-
payment of even part thereof or an instalment amount. 
For the meaning of -debt‖, we have to go to Section 
3(11), which in turn tells us that a debt means a liability 
of obligation in respect of a -claim‖ and for the 
meaning of -claim‖, we have to go back to Section 3(6) 
which defines -claim‖ to mean a right to payment even 
if it is disputed. The Code gets triggered the moment 
default is of rupees one lakh or more (Section 4). The 
corporate insolvency resolution process may be 
triggered by the corporate debtor itself or a financial 
creditor or operational creditor. A distinction is made 
by the Code between debts owed to financial creditors 


67 

and operational creditors. A financial creditor has been 
defined under Section 5(7) as a person to whom a 
financial debt is owed and a financial debt is defined in 
Section 5(8) to mean a debt which is disbursed against 
consideration for the time value of money. As opposed 
to this, an operational creditor means a person to 
whom an operational debt is owed and an operational 
debt under Section 5(21) means a claim in respect of 
provision of goods or services. 

28. When it comes to a financial creditor triggering the 
process, Section 7 becomes relevant. Under the 
Explanation to Section 7(1), a default is in respect of a 
financial debt owed to any financial creditor of the 
corporate debtor -it need not be a debt owed to the 
applicant financial creditor. Under Section 7(2), an 
application is to be made under sub-section (1) in such 
form and manner as is prescribed, which takes us to 
the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to 
Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016. Under Rule 4, the 
application is made by a financial creditor in Form 1 
accompanied by documents and records required 
therein. Form 1 is a detailed form in 5 parts, which 
requires particulars of the applicant in Part I, 
particulars of the corporate debtor in Part II, particulars 
of the proposed interim resolution professional in Part 
III, particulars of the financial debt in Part IV and 
documents, records and evidence of default in Part V. 
Under Rule 4(3), the applicant is to dispatch a copy of 
the application filed with the Adjudicating Authority by 
registered post or speed post to the registered office of 
the corporate debtor. The speed, within which the 
Adjudicating Authority is to ascertain the existence of a 
default from the records of the information utility or on 
the basis of evidence furnished by the financial 
creditor, is important. This it must do within 14 days of 
the receipt of the application. It is at the stage of 
Section 7(5), where the Adjudicating Authority is to be 
satisfied that a default has occurred, that the corporate 
debtor is entitled to point out that a default has not 


68 

occurred in the sense that the -debt‖, which may also 
include a disputed claim, is not due. A debt may not be 
due if it is not payable in law or in fact. The moment 
the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that a default has 
occurred, the application must be admitted unless it is 
incomplete, in which case it may give notice to the 
applicant to rectify the defect within 7 days of receipt of 
a notice from the Adjudicating Authority. Under sub-
section (7), the Adjudicating Authority shall then 
communicate the order passed to the financial creditor 
and corporate debtor within 7 days of admission or 
rejection of such application, as the case may be. 

29. The scheme of Section 7 stands in contrast with 
the scheme under Section 8 where an operational 
creditor is, on the occurrence of a default, to first 
deliver a demand notice of the unpaid debt to the 
operational debtor in the manner provided in Section 
8(1) of the Code. Under Section 8(2), the corporate 
debtor can, within a period of 10 days of receipt of the 
demand notice or copy of the invoice mentioned in 
sub-section (1), bring to the notice of the operational 
creditor the existence of a dispute or the record of the 
pendency of a suit or arbitration proceedings, which is 
pre-existing-i.e. before such notice or invoice was 
received by the corporate debtor. The moment there is 
existence of such a dispute, the operational creditor 
gets out of the clutches of the Code. 

30. On the other hand, as we have seen, in the case of 
a corporate debtor who commits a default of a financial 
debt, the Adjudicating Authority has merely to see the 
records of the information utility or other evidence 
produced by the financial creditor to satisfy itself that a 
default has occurred. It is of no matter that the debt is 
disputed so long as the debt is -due‖ i.e. payable 
unless interdicted by some law or has not yet become 
due in the sense that it is payable at some future date. 
It is only when this is proved to the satisfaction of the 
Adjudicating Authority that the Adjudicating Authority 
may reject an application and not otherwise.‖ 


69 

30. Section 3(9)(c) read with Section 214(e) of the Code are 

important and are set out as under: 

-3. Definitions.-In this Code, unless the context 
otherwise requires,-
xxx xxx xxx 
(9) -core services‖ means services rendered by an 
information utility for-
xxx xxx xxx 
(c) authenticating and verifying the financial 
information submitted by a person; and 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 

-214. Obligations of information utility.-For the 
purposes of providing core services to any person, 
every information utility shall-
xxx xxx xxx 
(e) get the information received from various 
persons authenticated by all concerned 
parties before storing such information; 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 

31. It is clear from these Sections that information in respect of debts 

incurred by financial debtors is easily available through information 

utilities which, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India 

(Information Utilities) Regulations, 2017 [-Information Utilities 

Regulations‖], are to satisfy themselves that information provided as 

to the debt is accurate. This is done by giving notice to the corporate 

debtor who then has an opportunity to correct such information. 


70 

32. Apart from the record maintained by such utility, Form I 

appended to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to 

Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016, makes it clear that the following 

are other sources which evidence a financial debt: 

(a) Particulars of security held, if any, the date of its 
creation, its estimated value as per the creditor; 
(b) Certificate of registration of charge issued by the 
registrar of companies (if the corporate debtor is a 
company); 
(c) Order of a court, tribunal or arbitral panel 
adjudicating on the default; 
(d) Record of default with the information utility; 
(e) Details of succession certificate, or probate of a 
will, or letter of administration, or court decree (as 
may be applicable), under the Indian Succession 
Act, 1925; 
(f) The latest and complete copy of the financial 
contract reflecting all amendments and waivers to 
date; 
(g) A record of default as available with any credit 
information company; 
(h) Copies of entries in a bankers book in accordance 
with the Bankers Books Evidence Act, 1891. 

33. Rule 4 (3) of the aforesaid Rules states as follows: 

-4. Application by financial creditor.-
xxx xxx xxx 
(3) The applicant shall dispatch forthwith, a 
copy of the application filed with the 
Adjudicating Authority, by registered post or 
speed post to the registered office of the 
corporate debtor. 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 


71 

Section 420 of the Companies Act, 2013 states as follows: 

-420. Orders of Tribunal.-(1) The Tribunal may, 
after giving the parties to any proceeding before it, a 
reasonable opportunity of being heard, pass such 
orders thereon as it thinks fit. 

(2) The Tribunal may, at any time within two years 
from the date of the order, with a view to rectifying any 
mistake apparent from the record, amend any order 
passed by it, and shall make such amendment, if the 
mistake is brought to its notice by the parties: 

Provided that no such amendment shall be made in 
respect of any order against which an appeal has been 
preferred under this Act. 

(3) The Tribunal shall send a copy of every order 
passed under this section to all the parties concerned.‖ 

Rules 11, 34, and 37 of the National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 

2016 [-NCLT Rules‖] state as follows: 

-11. Inherent Powers.-Nothing in these rules shall be 
deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent powers 
of the Tribunal to make such orders as may be 
necessary for meeting the ends of justice or to prevent 
abuse of the process of the Tribunal.‖ 

xxx xxx xxx 

34. General Procedure.-(1) In a situation not 
provided for in these rules, the Tribunal may, for 
reasons to be recorded in writing, determine the 
procedure in a particular case in accordance with the 
principles of natural justice. 


72 

(2) The general heading in all proceedings before the 
Tribunal, in all advertisements and notices shall be in 
Form No. NCLT 4. 
(3) Every petition or application or reference shall be 
filed in form as provided in Form No. NCLT 1 with 
attachments thereto accompanied by Form No. NCLT 
2 and in case of an interlocutory application, the same 
shall be filed in Form No. NCLT 1 accompanied by 
such attachments thereto along with Form No. NCLT 
3. 
(4) Every petition or application including interlocutory 
application shall be verified by an affidavit in Form No. 
NCLT 6. Notice to be issued by the Tribunal to the 
opposite party shall be in Form NCLT 5.‖ 

xxx xxx xxx 

-37. Notice to Opposite Party.-(1) The Tribunal shall 
issue notice to the respondent to show cause against 
the application or petition on a date of hearing to be 
specified in the Notice. Such notice in Form No. NCLT 
5 shall be accompanied by a copy of the application 
with supporting documents. 
(2) If the respondent does not appear on the date 
specified in the notice in Form No. NCLT 5, the 
Tribunal, after according reasonable opportunity to the 
respondent, shall forthwith proceed ex-parte to 
dispose of the application. 
(3) If the respondent contests to the notice received 
under sub-rule (1), it may, either in person or through 
an authorised representative, file a reply accompanied 
with an affidavit and along with copies of such 
documents on which it relies, with an advance service 
to the petitioner or applicant, to the Registry before the 
date of hearing and such reply and copies of 
documents shall form part of the record.‖ 


73 

A conjoint reading of all these Rules makes it clear that at the stage of 

the Adjudicating Authority's satisfaction under Section 7(5) of the 

Code, the corporate debtor is served with a copy of the application filed 

with the Adjudicating Authority and has the opportunity to file a reply 

before the said authority and be heard by the said authority before an 

order is made admitting the said application. What is also of relevance 

is that in order to protect the corporate debtor from being dragged into 

the corporate insolvency resolution process malafide, the Code 

prescribes penalties. Thus, Section 65 of the Code reads as follows: 

-65. Fraudulent or malicious initiation of 
proceedings.-(1) If, any person initiates the 
insolvency 
resolution 
process 
or 
liquidation 
proceedings fraudulently or with malicious intent for 
any purpose other than for the resolution of 
insolvency, or liquidation, as the case may be, the 
Adjudicating Authority may impose upon such person 
a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees, 
but may extend to one crore rupees. 
(2) If, any person initiates voluntary liquidation 
proceedings with the intent to defraud any person, the 
Adjudicating Authority may impose upon such person 
a penalty which shall not be less than one lakh rupees 
but may extend to one crore rupees.‖ 

34. Also, punishment is prescribed under Section 75 for furnishing 

false information in an application made by a financial creditor which 


74 

further deters a financial creditor from wrongly invoking the provisions 

of Section 7. Section 75 reads as under: 

-75. Punishment for false information furnished in 
application.-Where any person furnishes information 
in the application made under Section 7, which is false 
in material particulars, knowing it to be false or omits 
any material fact, knowing it to be material, such 
person shall be punishable with fine which shall not be 
less than one lakh rupees, but may extend to one 
crore rupees.‖ 

35. Insofar as set-off and counterclaim is concerned, a set-off of 

amounts due from financial creditors is a rarity. Usually, financial debts 

point only in one way -amounts lent have to be repaid. However, it is 

not as if a legitimate set-off is not to be considered at all. Such set-off 

may be considered at the stage of filing of proof of claims during the 

resolution process by the resolution professional, his decision being 

subject to challenge before the Adjudicating Authority under Section 

60. Section 60(5)(c) reads as follows: 

-60. 
Adjudicating 
Authority 
for 
corporate 
persons.-
xxx xxx xxx 
(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
in any other law for the time being in force, the 
National Company Law Tribunal shall have jurisdiction 
to entertain or dispose of-
xxx xxx xxx 


75 

(c) any question of priorities or any question 
of law or facts, arising out of or in relation to 
the insolvency resolution or liquidation 
proceedings of the corporate debtor or 
corporate person under this Code.‖ 

36. Equally, counterclaims, by their very definition, are independent 

rights which are not taken away by the Code but are preserved for the 

stage of admission of claims during the resolution plan. Also, there is 

nothing in the Code which interdicts the corporate debtor from pursuing 

such counterclaims in other judicial fora. Form C dealing with 

submission of claims by financial creditors in the CIRP Regulations 

states thus: 

-FORM C

37. The trigger for a financial creditor's application is non-payment of 

dues when they arise under loan agreements. It is for this reason that 

Section 433(e) of the Companies Act, 1956 has been repealed by the 

Code and a change in approach has been brought about. Legislative 

policy now is to move away from the concept of -inability to pay debts‖ 

to -determination of default‖. The said shift enables the financial 

creditor to prove, based upon solid documentary evidence, that there 

was an obligation to pay the debt and that the debtor has failed in such 

obligation. Four policy reasons have been stated by the learned 

Solicitor General for this shift in legislative policy. First is predictability 

and certainty. Secondly, the paramount interest to be safeguarded is 

that of the corporate debtor and admission into the insolvency 

resolution process does not prejudice such interest but, in fact, 

protects it. Thirdly, in a situation of financial stress, the cause of default 

is not relevant; protecting the economic interest of the corporate debtor 

is more relevant. Fourthly, the trigger that would lead to liquidation can 

only be upon failure of the resolution process. 


80 

38. In this context, it is important to differentiate between -claim‖, 

-debt‖ and -default‖. Each of these terms is separately defined as 

follows: 

-3. Definitions.-In this Code, unless the context 
otherwise requires,-
xxx xxx xxx 
(6) -claim‖ means-
(a) a right to payment, whether or not such 
right is reduced to judgment, fixed, disputed, 
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or 
unsecured; 
(b) right to remedy for breach of contract 
under any law for the time being in force, if 
such breach gives rise to a right to payment, 
whether or not such right is reduced to 
judgment, fixed, matured, unmatured, 
disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured; 
xxx xxx xxx 

(11) -debt‖ means a liability or obligation in respect of 
a claim which is due from any person and includes a 
financial debt and operational debt; 

(12) -default‖ means non-payment of debt when whole 
or any part or instalment of the amount of debt has 
become due and payable and is not paid by the debtor 
or the corporate debtor, as the case may be; 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 

Whereas a -claim‖ gives rise to a -debt‖ only when it becomes -due‖, a 

-default‖ occurs only when a -debt‖ becomes -due and payable‖ and is 

not paid by the debtor. It is for this reason that a financial creditor has 

to prove -default‖ as opposed to an operational creditor who merely 


81 

-claims‖ a right to payment of a liability or obligation in respect of a 

debt which may be due. When this aspect is borne in mind, the 

differentiation in the triggering of insolvency resolution process by 

financial creditors under Section 7 and by operational creditors under 

Sections 8 and 9 of the Code becomes clear. 

SECTIONS 21 AND 24 AND ARTICLE 14: OPERATIONAL CREDITORS HAVE NO 

VOTE IN THE COMMITTEE OF CREDITORS. 

39. Section 21 of the Code reads as follows: 

-21. Committee of creditors.-(1) The interim 
resolution professional shall after collation of all claims 
received against the corporate debtor and 
determination of the financial position of the corporate 
debtor, constitute a committee of creditors. 

(2) The committee of creditors shall comprise all 
financial creditors of the corporate debtor: 

Provided that a financial creditor or the authorised 
representative of the financial creditor referred to in 
sub-section (6) or sub-section (6-A) or sub-section (5) 
of Section 24, if it is a related party of the corporate 
debtor, shall not have any right of representation, 
participation or voting in a meeting of the committee of 
creditors: 

Provided further that the first proviso shall not apply 
to a financial creditor, regulated by a financial sector 
regulator, if it is a related party of the corporate debtor 
solely on account of conversion or substitution of debt 
into equity shares or instruments convertible into 
equity shares, prior to the insolvency commencement 
date. 


82 

(3) Subject to sub-sections (6) and (6-A), where the 
corporate debtor owes financial debts to two or more

agreement, each such financial creditor shall be part of 
the committee of creditors and their voting share shall 
be determined on the basis of the financial debts owed 
to them. 

(4) Where any person is a financial creditor as well as 
an operational creditor,-
(a) such person shall be a financial creditor to 
the extent of the financial debt owed by the 
corporate debtor, and shall be included in the

proportionate to the extent of financial debts 
owed to such creditor; 
(b) such person shall be considered to be an 
operational creditor to the extent of the 
operational debt owed by the corporate 
debtor to such creditor. 

(5) Where an operational creditor has assigned or 
legally transferred any operational debt to a financial 
creditor, the assignee or transferee shall be 
considered as an operational creditor to the extent of 
such assignment or legal transfer. 

(6) Where the terms of the financial debt extended as 
part of a consortium arrangement or syndicated facility 
provide for a single trustee or agent to act for all 
financial creditors, each financial creditor may-
(a) authorize the trustee or agent to act on his 
behalf in the committee of creditors to the 
extent of his voting share; 
(b) represent himself in the committee of 
creditors to the extent of his voting share; 
(c) appoint an insolvency professional (other 
than the resolution professional) at his own 
cost to represent himself in the committee of 
creditors to the extent of his voting share; or 


83 

(d) exercise his right to vote to the extent of 
his voting share with one or more financial 
creditors jointly or severally. 

(6-A) Where a financial debt-
(a) is in the form of securities or deposits and 
the terms of the financial debt provide for 
appointment of a trustee or agent to act as 
authorised representative for all the financial 
creditors, such trustee or agent shall act on 
behalf of such financial creditors; 
(b) is owed to a class of creditors exceeding 
the number as may be specified, other than 
the creditors covered under clause (a) or sub-
section (6), the interim resolution professional 
shall make an application to the Adjudicating 
Authority along with the list of all financial 
creditors, containing the name of an 
insolvency professional, other than the 
interim resolution professional, to act as their 
authorised representative who shall be 
appointed by the Adjudicating Authority prior 
to the first meeting of the committee of 
creditors; 
(c) is represented by a guardian, executor or 
administrator, such person shall act as 
authorised representative on behalf of such 
financial creditors, 
and such authorised representative under clause (a) or 
clause (b) or clause (c) shall attend the meetings of 
the committee of creditors, and vote on behalf of each 
financial creditor to the extent of his voting share. 

(6-B) The remuneration payable to the authorised 
representative-
(i) under clauses (a) and (c) of sub-section 
(6-A), if any, shall be as per the terms of the 
financial debt or the relevant documentation; 
and 


84 

(ii) under clause (b) of sub-section (6-A) shall 
be as specified which shall form part of the 
insolvency resolution process costs. 

(7) The Board may specify the manner of voting and 
the determining of the voting share in respect of 
financial debts covered under sub-sections (6) and (6-
A). 

(8) Save as otherwise provided in this Code, all 
decisions of the committee of creditors shall be taken 
by a vote of not less than fifty-one per cent. of voting 
share of the financial creditors: 

Provided that where a corporate debtor does not 
have any financial creditors, the committee of creditors 
shall be constituted and shall comprise of such 
persons to exercise such functions in such manner as 
may be specified. 

(9) The committee of creditors shall have the right to 
require the resolution professional to furnish any 
financial information in relation to the corporate debtor 
at any time during the corporate insolvency resolution 
process. 

(10) The resolution professional shall make available 
any financial information so required by the committee 
of creditors under sub-section (9) within a period of 
seven days of such requisition.‖ 

40. Section 24(3), 24(4), and Section 28, which are also material, 

read as follows: 

-24. Meeting of committee of creditors.-
xxx xxx xxx 
(3) The resolution professional shall give notice of 
each meeting of the committee of creditors to-
(a) members of [committee of creditors, 
including the authorised representatives 


85 

referred to in sub-sections (6) and (6-A) of 
Section 21 and sub-section (5)]; 
(b) members of the suspended Board of 
Directors or the partners of the corporate 
persons, as the case may be;

operational creditors, as referred to in sub-section (3), 
may attend the meetings of committee of creditors, but 
shall not have any right to vote in such meetings:

partner or representative of operational creditors, as 
the case may be, shall not invalidate proceedings of 
such meeting.

-28. Approval of committee of creditors for certain 
actions.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in 
any other law for the time being in force, the resolution 
professional, during the corporate insolvency 
resolution process, shall not take any of the following 
actions without the prior approval of the committee of 
creditors namely-
(a) raise any interim finance in excess of the 
amount as may be decided by the committee 
of creditors in their meeting; 
(b) create any security interest over the 
assets of the corporate debtor; 
(c) change the capital structure of the 
corporate debtor, including by way of 
issuance of additional securities, creating a 
new class of securities or buying back or 
redemption of issued securities in case the 
corporate debtor is a company; 


86 

(d) record any change in the ownership 
interest of the corporate debtor; 
(e) give instructions to financial institutions 
maintaining accounts of the corporate debtor 
for a debit transaction from any such 
accounts in excess of the amount as may be 
decided by the committee of creditors in their 
meeting; 
(f) undertake any related party transaction; 
(g) amend any constitutional documents of 
the corporate debtor; 
(h) delegate its authority to any other person; 
(i) dispose of or permit the disposal of shares 
of any shareholder of the corporate debtor or 
their nominees to third parties; 
(j) make any change in the management of 
the corporate debtor or its subsidiary; 
(k) transfer rights or financial debts or 
operational debts under material contracts 
otherwise than in the ordinary course of 
business; 
(l) make changes in the appointment or terms

the committee of creditors; or 
(m) make changes in the appointment or 
terms of contract of statutory auditors or

(2) The resolution professional shall convene a 
meeting of the committee of creditors and seek the 
vote of the creditors prior to taking any of the actions 
under sub-section (1). 
(3) No action under sub-section (1) shall be approved 
by the committee of creditors unless approved by a 
vote of sixty-six per cent of the voting shares. 

(4) Where any action under sub-section (1) is taken by 
the resolution professional without seeking the 
approval of the committee of creditors in the manner 
as required in this section, such action shall be void. 


87 

(5) The committee of creditors may report the actions 
of the resolution professional under sub-section (4) to 
the Board for taking necessary actions against him 
under this Code. Approval of committee of creditors for 
certain actions.‖ 

41. In this regard, the BLRC Report states: 

-The creditors committee will have the power to decide 
the final solution by majority vote in the negotiations. 
The majority vote requires more than or equal to 75 
percent of the creditors committee by weight of the 
total financial liabilities…… The Committee deliberated 
on who should be on the creditors committee, given 
the power of the creditors committee to ultimately keep 
the entity as a going concern or liquidate it. The 
Committee reasoned that members of the creditors 
committee have to be creditors both with the capability 
to assess viability, as well as to be willing to modify 
terms of existing liabilities in negotiations. Typically, 
operational creditors are neither able to decide on 
matters regarding the insolvency of the entity, nor 
willing to take the risk of postponing payments for 
better future prospects for the entity. The Committee 
concluded that, for the process to be rapid and 
efficient, the Code will provide that the creditors 
committee should be restricted to only the financial 
creditors.‖ 

-The second is that any proposed solution must 
explicitly account for the IRP costs and the liabilities of 
the operational creditors within a reasonable period 
from the approval of the solution if it is approved. The 
Committee argues that there must be a 
counterbalance to operational creditors not having a 
vote on the creditors committee. Thus, they concluded 
that the dues of the operational creditors must have 
priority in being paid as an explicit part of the proposed 
solution. This must be ensured by the RP in evaluating 
a proposal before bringing it to the creditors 


88 

committee. If there is ambiguity about the coverage of 
the liability in the information memorandum that the 
RP presents to garner solutions, then the RP must 
ensure that this is clearly stated and accounted for in 
the proposed solution.‖ 

The Joint Parliamentary Committee Report of April, 2016 [-Joint 

Parliamentary Committee Report‖] on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 

Code also agreed with these observations but modified Section 24 so 

as to permit operational creditors to be present at the meetings of the 

committee of creditors, albeit without voting rights, if operational 

creditors to 10% or more of the total debts owed by the 

corporate debtor. 

The Joint Parliamentary Committee Report also opined as follows: 

-21. Role of Operational Creditors -Clause 24 

Some of the stakeholders in the memorandum/views 
furnished before the Committee were of the opinion 
that whereas operation creditor has right to make 
application for initiation of corporate insolvency 
resolution process, operational creditors like workmen, 
employees, suppliers have not been given any 
representation in the committee of creditors which is 
pivotal in whole resolution process. In this regard, one 
of the stakeholders has suggested that committee of 
creditors may contain operational creditors as well, 
with some thresholds. 

In this context, while appreciating that the operational 
creditors are important stakeholders in a company, the 


89 

Committee took note of the rationale of not including 
operational creditors in the committee of creditors as 
indicated in notes on Clause 21 appended with the Bill 
which states as under:-

-The committee has to be composed of 
members who have the capability to assess 
the commercial viability of the corporate 
debtor and who are willing to modify the 
terms of the debt contracts in negotiations 
between the creditors and the corporate 
debtor. Operational creditors are typically not 
able to decide on matters relating to 
commercial viability of the corporate debtor, 
nor are they typically willing to take the risk of 
restructuring their debts in order to make the 
corporate debtor a going concern. Similarly, 
financial creditors who are also operational 
creditors will be given representation on the 
committee of creditors only to the extent of 
their financial debts. Nevertheless, in order to 
ensure that the financial creditors do not treat 
the operational creditors unfairly, any 
resolution plan must ensure that the 
operational creditors receive an amount not 
less than the liquidation value of their debt 
(assuming the corporate debtor were to be 
liquidated). 

All decisions of the Committee shall be taken by a vote 
of not less than seventy-five per cent of the voting 
share. In the event there are no financial creditors for a 
corporate debtor, the composition and decision-
making processes of the corporate debtor shall be 
specified by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board. 
The Committee shall also have the power to call for 
information from the resolution professional.‖ 

The Committee after due deliberations are of the view 
that, if not voting rights, operational creditors at least 
should have presence in the committee of creditors to 


90 

present their views/concerns on important issues 
considered at the meetings so that their 
views/concerns are taken into account by the 
committee of creditors while finalizing the resolution 
plan.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

The original Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill did not allow operational 

creditors to attend the committee of creditors at all. This Bill was 

amended whilst in the form of a Bill, the Joint Parliamentary Committee 

deciding as follows: 

-The Committee, therefore, decided to modify clause 
24(3) and (4) as given under: 

Modified Clause 24(3)-

-The resolution professional shall give notice of each 
meeting of the committee of creditors to-

(a) members of committee of creditors; 
(b) members of the suspended Board of 
Directors or the partners of the corporate 
persons, as the case may be; 
(c) operational creditors or their representatives 
if the amount of their aggregate dues is not less 
than ten per cent of the debt.‖ 
Modified Clause 24(4)-

-The directors, partners and one representative of 
operational creditors as referred to in sub-section (3), 
may attend the meetings of committee of creditors, but 
shall not have any right to vote in such meetings: 

Provided that the absence of any such director, 
partner or representative of operational creditors, as 
the case may be, shall not invalidate proceedings of 
such meeting.‖ 


91 

42. What is also of importance is the fact that Expert Committees 

have been set up by the Government to oversee the working of the 

Code. Thus, the report of the Insolvency Law Committee of March, 

2018, after examining the working of the Code, thought it fit not to 

amend the Code so as to give operational creditors the right to vote. 

This was stated as follows: 

-This rationale still holds true, and thus it was deemed 
fit not to amend the constitution of the CoC. Further, 
operational creditors whose aggregate dues are not 
less than ten percent of the debt have a right to attend 
the meetings of the CoC. Also, under the resolution 
plan, they are guaranteed at least the liquidation 
value.‖ 

-…The Committee agreed that presently, most of the 
resolution plans are in the process of submission and 
there is no empirical evidence to further the argument 
that operational creditors do not receive a fair share in 
the resolution process under the current scheme of the 
Code. Hence, the Committee decided to continue with 
the present arrangement without making any 
amendments to the Code.‖ 

43. Under the Code, the committee of creditors is entrusted with the 

primary responsibility of financial restructuring. They are required to 

assess the viability of a corporate debtor by taking into account all 

available information as well as to evaluate all alternative investment 


92 

opportunities that are available. The committee of creditors is required 

to evaluate the resolution plan on the basis of feasibility and viability. 

Thus, Section 30(4) states: 

-30. Submission of resolution plan.-

xxx xxx xxx 

(4) The committee of creditors may approve a 
resolution plan by a vote of not less than sixty-six per 
cent of voting share of the financial creditors, after 
considering its feasibility and viability, and such other 
requirements as may be specified by the Board: 

Provided that the committee of creditors shall not 
approve a resolution plan, submitted before the 
commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017, where the 
resolution applicant is ineligible under Section 29A and 
may require the resolution professional to invite a fresh 
resolution plan where no other resolution plan is 
available with it: 

Provided further that where the resolution applicant 
referred to in the first proviso is ineligible under clause 
(c) of Section 29A, the resolution applicant shall be 
allowed by the committee of creditors such period, not 
exceeding thirty days, to make payment of overdue 
amounts in accordance with the proviso to clause (c) 
of Section 29A: 

Provided also that nothing in the second proviso 
shall be construed as extension of period for the 
purposes of the proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 
12, and the corporate insolvency resolution process 
shall be completed within the period specified in that 
sub-section. 

Provided also that the eligibility criteria in Section 
29A as amended by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 (Ord. 6 of 2018) 


93 

shall apply to the resolution applicant who has not 
submitted resolution plan as on the date of 
commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018. 

xxx xxx xxx‖ 

It is important to bear in mind that once the resolution plan is approved 

by the committee of creditors and thereafter by the Adjudicating 

Authority, the aforesaid plan is binding on all stakeholders as follows: 

-31. Approval of resolution plan.-(1) If the 
Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the resolution 
plan as approved by the committee of creditors under 
sub-section (4) of Section 30 meets the requirements 
as referred to in sub-section (2) of Section 30, it shall 
by order approve the resolution plan which shall be 
binding on the corporate debtor and its employees, 
members, 
creditors, 
guarantors 
and 
other 
stakeholders involved in the resolution plan: 

Provided that the Adjudicating Authority shall, 
before passing an order for approval of resolution plan 
under this sub-section, satisfy that the resolution plan 
has provisions for its effective implementation. 

xxx xxx xxx‖ 

44. Since the financial creditors are in the business of money 

lending, banks and financial institutions are best equipped to assess 

viability and feasibility of the business of the corporate debtor. Even at 

the time of granting loans, these banks and financial institutions 

undertake a detailed market study which includes a techno-economic 


94 

valuation report, evaluation of business, financial projection, etc. Since 

this detailed study has already been undertaken before sanctioning a 

loan, and since financial creditors have trained employees to assess 

viability and feasibility, they are in a good position to evaluate the 

contents of a resolution plan. On the other hand, operational creditors, 

who provide goods and services, are involved only in recovering 

amounts that are paid for such goods and services, and are typically 

unable to assess viability and feasibility of business. The BLRC 

Report, already quoted above, makes this abundantly clear. 

45. Quite apart from this, the United Nations Commission on 

International Trade Law, in its Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law 

[-UNCITRAL Guidelines‖] recognizes the importance of ensuring 

equitable treatment to similarly placed creditors and states as follows: 

"Ensuring equitable treatment of similarly situated 
creditors 

7. The objective of equitable treatment is based on the 
notion that, in collective proceedings, creditors with 
similar legal rights should be treated fairly, receiving a 
distribution on their claim in accordance with their 
relative ranking and interests. This key objective 
recognizes that all creditors do not need to be treated 
identically, but in a manner that reflects the different 
bargains they have struck with the debtor. This is less 
relevant as a defining factor where there is no specific 
debt contract with the debtor, such as in the case of 


95 

damage claimants (e.g. for environmental damage) 
and tax authorities. Even though the principle of 
equitable treatment may be modified by social policy 
on priorities and give way to the prerogatives 
pertaining to holders of claims or interests that arise, 
for example, by operation of law, it retains its 
significance by 12 UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on 
Insolvency Law ensuring that the priority accorded to 
the claims of a similar class affects all members of the 
class in the same manner. The policy of equitable 
treatment permeates many aspects of an insolvency 
law, including the application of the stay or 
suspension, provisions to set aside acts and 
transactions and recapture value for the insolvency 
estate, classification of claims, voting procedures in 
reorganization and distribution mechanisms. An 
insolvency law should address problems of fraud and 
favouritism that may arise in cases of financial distress 
by providing, for example, that acts and transactions 
detrimental to equitable treatment of creditors can be 
avoided.‖ 

46. The NCLAT has, while looking into viability and feasibility of 

resolution plans that are approved by the committee of creditors, 

always gone into whether operational creditors are given roughly the 

same treatment as financial creditors, and if they are not, such plans 

are either rejected or modified so that the operational creditors' rights 

are safeguarded. It may be seen that a resolution plan cannot pass 

muster under Section 30(2)(b) read with Section 31 unless a minimum 

payment is made to operational creditors, being not less than 


96 

liquidation value. Further, on 05.10.2018, Regulation 38 has been 

amended. Prior to the amendment, Regulation 38 read as follows: 

-38. Mandatory contents of the resolution plan.-
(1) A resolution plan shall identify specific sources of 
funds that will be used to pay the-
(a) insolvency resolution process costs and 
provide that the [insolvency resolution 
process costs, to the extent unpaid, will be 
paid] in priority to any other creditor; 
(b) liquidation value due to operational 
creditors and provide for such payment in 
priority to any financial creditor which shall in 
any event be made before the expiry of thirty 
days after the approval of a resolution plan by 
the Adjudicating Authority; and 
(c) liquidation value due to dissenting 
financial creditors and provide that such 
payment is made before any recoveries are 
made by the financial creditors who voted in 
favour of the resolution plan.‖ 

Post amendment, Regulation 38 reads as follows: 

-38. Mandatory contents of the resolution plan.-
(1) The amount due to the operational creditors under 
a resolution plan shall be given priority in payment 
over financial creditors. 
(1-A) A resolution plan shall include a statement as to 
how it has dealt with the interests of all stakeholders, 
including financial creditors and operational creditors, 
of the corporate debtor. 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 


97 

47. The aforesaid Regulation further strengthens the rights of 

operational creditors by statutorily incorporating the principle of fair and 

equitable dealing of operational creditors' rights, together with priority 

in payment over financial creditors. 

48. For all the aforesaid reasons, we do not find that operational 

creditors are discriminated against or that Article 14 has been infracted 

either on the ground of equals being treated unequally or on the 

ground of manifest arbitrariness. 

SECTION 12A IS NOT VIOLATIVE OF ARTICLE 14 

49. Section 12A was inserted by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 

(Second Amendment) Act, 2018 with retrospective effect from 

06.06.2018. It reads as follows: 

-12-A. Withdrawal of application admitted under 
Section 7, 9 or 10.-The Adjudicating Authority may 
allow the withdrawal of application admitted under 
Section 7 or Section 9 or Section 10, on an application 
made by the applicant with the approval of ninety per 
cent voting share of the committee of creditors, in such 
manner as may be specified.‖ 

50. The ILC Report of March 2018, which led to the insertion of 

Section 12A, stated as follows: 


98 

-29.1 Under rule 8 of the CIRP Rules, the NCLT may 
permit withdrawal of the application on a request by 
the applicant before its admission. However, there is 
no provision in the Code or the CIRP Rules in relation 
to permissibility of withdrawal post admission of a 
CIRP application. It was by the Committee 
that there have been instances where on account of 
settlement between the applicant creditor and the 
corporate debtor, judicial permission for withdrawal of 
CIRP was granted [Lokhandwala Kataria Construction 
Pvt. Ltd. v. Ninus Finance & Investment Manager LLP, 
Civil Appeal No. 9279 of 2017; Mothers Pride Dairy 
India Private Limited v. Portrait Advertising and 
Marketing Private Limited, Civil Appeal No. 9286/2017; 
Uttara Foods and Feeds Private Limited v. Mona 
Pharmacem, Civil Appeal No. 18520/2017]. This 
practice was deliberated in light of the objective of the 
Code as encapsulated in the BLRC Report, that the 
design of the Code is based on ensuring that -all key 
stakeholders will participate to collectively assess 
viability. The law must ensure that all creditors who 
have the capability and the willingness to restructure 
their liabilities must be part of the negotiation process. 
The liabilities of all creditors who are not part of the 
negotiation process must also be met in any 
negotiated solution.‖ Thus, it was agreed that once the 
CIRP is initiated, it is no longer a proceeding only 
between the applicant creditor and the corporate 
debtor but is envisaged to be a proceeding involving 
all creditors of the debtor. The intent of the Code is to 
discourage individual actions for enforcement and 
settlement to the exclusion of the general benefit of all 
creditors. 
(emphasis in original) 

29.2 On a review of the multiple NCLT and NCLAT 
judgments in this regard, the consistent pattern that 
emerged was that a settlement may be reached 
amongst all creditors and the debtor, for the purpose 
of a withdrawal to be granted, and not only the 


99 

applicant creditor and the debtor. On this basis read 
with the intent of the Code, the Committee 
unanimously agreed that the relevant rules may be 
amended to provide for withdrawal post admission if 
the CoC of such action by a voting share of 
ninety per cent. It was specifically discussed that rule 
11 of the National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016 
may not be adopted for this aspect of CIRP at this 
stage (as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
the case of Uttara Foods and Feeds Private Limited v. 
Mona Pharmacem, Civil Appeal No. 18520/2017) and 
even otherwise, as the issue can be specifically 
addressed by amending rule 8 of the CIRP Rules.‖ 

51. Before this Section was inserted, this Court, under Article 142, 

was passing orders allowing withdrawal of applications after creditors' 

applications had been admitted by the NCLT or the NCLAT. 

Regulation 30A of the CIRP Regulations states as under: 

-30A. Withdrawal of application.-(1) An application 
for withdrawal under Section 12-A shall be submitted 
to the interim resolution professional or the resolution 
professional, as the case may be, in Form FA of the 
Schedule before issue of invitation for expression of 
interest under Regulation 36A. 
(2) The application in sub-regulation (1) shall be 
accompanied by a bank guarantee towards estimated 
cost incurred for purposes of clauses (c) and (d) of 
Regulation 31 till the date of application. 
(3) The committee shall consider the application made 
under sub-regulation (1) within seven days of its 
constitution or seven days of receipt of the application, 
whichever is later. 


100 

(4) Where the application is approved by the 
committee with ninety percent voting share, the 
resolution professional shall submit the application 
under sub-regulation (1) to the Adjudicating Authority 
on behalf of the applicant, within three days of such 
approval. 
(5) The Adjudicating Authority may, by order, approve 
the application submitted under sub-regulation (4).‖ 

This Court, by its order dated 14.12.2018 in Brilliant Alloys Pvt. Ltd. 

v. Mr. S. Rajagopal & Ors., SLP (Civil) No. 31557/2018, has stated 

that Regulation 30A(1) is not mandatory but is directory for the simple 

reason that on the facts of a given case, an application for withdrawal 

may be allowed in exceptional cases even after issue of invitation for 

expression of interest under Regulation 36A. 

52. It is clear that once the Code gets triggered by admission of a 

creditor's petition under Sections 7 to 9, the proceeding that is before 

the Adjudicating Authority, being a collective proceeding, is a 

proceeding in rem. Being a proceeding in rem, it is necessary that the 

body which is to oversee the resolution process must be consulted 

before any individual corporate debtor is allowed to settle its claim. A 

question arises as to what is to happen before a committee of creditors 

is constituted (as per the timelines that are specified, a committee of 

creditors can be appointed at any time within 30 days from the date of 


101 

appointment of the interim resolution professional). We make it clear 

that at any stage where the committee of creditors is not yet 

constituted, a party can approach the NCLT directly, which Tribunal 

may, in exercise of its inherent powers under Rule 11 of the NCLT 

Rules, 2016, allow or disallow an application for withdrawal or 

settlement. This will be decided after hearing all the concerned parties 

and considering all relevant factors on the facts of each case. 

53. The main thrust against the provision of Section 12A is the fact 

that ninety per cent of the committee of creditors has to allow 

withdrawal. This high threshold has been explained in the ILC Report 

as all financial creditors have to put their heads together to allow such 

withdrawal as, ordinarily, an omnibus settlement involving all creditors 

ought, ideally, to be entered into. This explains why ninety per cent, 

which is substantially all the financial creditors, have to grant their 

approval to an individual withdrawal or settlement. In any case, the 

figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anything further to show 

that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain of legislative policy, 

which has been explained by the Report (supra). Also, it is clear, that 

under Section 60 of the Code, the committee of creditors do not have 

the last word on the subject. If the committee of creditors arbitrarily 


102 

rejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, and 

thereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision under 

Section 60 of the Code. For all these reasons, we are of the view that 

Section 12A also passes constitutional muster. 

EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY PRIVATE INFORMATION UTILITIES: ONLY PRIMA FACIE 

EVIDENCE OF DEFAULT 

54. A frontal attack was made by Shri Mukul Rohatgi on the ground 

that private information utilities that have been set up are not governed 

by proper norms. Also, the evidence by way of loan default contained 

in the records of such utility cannot be conclusive evidence of what is 

stated therein. The BLRC Report had stated: 

-Under the present arrangements, considerable time 
can be lost before all parties obtain this information. 
Disputes about these facts can take up years to 
resolve in court…… Hence, the Committee envisions a 
competitive industry of -information utilities‖ who hold 
an array of information about all firms at all times. 
When the IRP commences, within less than a day, 
undisputed and complete information would become 
available to all persons involved in the IRP and thus 
address this source of delay.‖ 

55. The setting up of information utilities was preceded by a regime 

of information companies which were referred to as credit information 


103 

companies [-CICs‖], as recommended by the Siddiqui Working Group 

in 1999. The Attorney General pointed out, in his written submission, 

that: 

-In 2013, the RBI constituted another Committee under 
the chairmanship of Aditya Puri, MD, HDFC Bank to 
examine reporting formats used by CICs and other 
related issues. The Committee's report led to the 
standardization of data formats for reporting corporate, 
consumer and MFI data by all credit institutions and 
streamlining the process of data submission by credit 
institutions to CICs. In 2015, all credit institutions were 
directed by RBI to become members of all the CICs 
and submit current and historical data about specified 
borrower to them and to update it regularly. 

The purpose of setting up the above regime of 
information utilities was to reduce information 
asymmetry for improved credit risk assessment and to 
improve recovery processes. 

The setting up of IUs marks a shift in the above 
position as not only is the information with IUs used to 
reduce information asymmetry, but it is also to be 
treated as prima facie evidence of the transaction for 
the purpose of IBC proceedings. This assists in 
improving the timelines for the resolution process.‖ 

56. The Information Utilities Regulations, in particular Regulations 20 

and 21, make it clear that on receipt of information of default, an 

information utility shall expeditiously undertake the process of 

authentication and verification of information. Regulations 20 and 21 

read as follows: 


104 

-20. Acceptance and receipt of information.-(1) An 
information utility shall accept information submitted by 
a user in Form C of the Schedule. 
(2) On receipt of the information submitted under sub-
regulation (1), the information utility shall-
(a) assign a unique identifier to the information, 
including records of debt; 
(b) acknowledge its receipt, and notify the user 
of-
(i) the unique identifier of the information; 
(ii) the terms and conditions of authentication 
and verification of information; and 
(iii) the manner in which the information may 
be accessed by other parties. 

21. Information of default.-(1) On receipt of 
information of default, an information utility shall 
expeditiously 
undertake 
the 
processes 
of 
authentication and verification of the information. 
(2) On completion of the processes of authentication 
and verification under sub-regulation (1), the 
information utility shall communicate the information of 
default, and the status of authentication to registered 
users who are-
(a) creditors of the debtor who has defaulted; 
(b) parties and sureties, if any, to the debt in 
respect of which the information of default 
has been received.‖ 

57. The aforesaid Regulations also make it clear that apart from the 

stringent requirements as to registration of such utility, the moment 

information of default is received, such information has to be 

communicated to all parties and sureties to the debt. Apart from this, 

the utility is to expeditiously undertake the process of authentication 


105 

and verification of information, which will include authentication and 

verification from the debtor who has defaulted. This being the case, 

coupled with the fact that such evidence, as has been conceded by the 

learned Attorney General, is only prima facie evidence of default, 

which is rebuttable by the corporate debtor, makes it clear that the 

challenge based on this ground must also fail. 

RESOLUTION PROFESSIONAL HAS NO ADJUDICATORY POWERS. 

58. It is clear from a reading of the Code as well as the Regulations 

that the resolution professional has no adjudicatory powers. Section 18 

of the Code lays down the duties of an interim resolution professional 

as follows: 

-18. Duties of interim resolution professional.-(1) 
The interim resolution professional shall perform the 
following duties, namely-
(a) collect all information relating to the assets, 
finances and operations of the corporate debtor 
for determining the financial position of the 
corporate debtor, including information relating 
to-
(i) business operations for the previous two 
years; 
(ii) financial and operational payments for the 
previous two years; 
(iii) list of assets and liabilities as on the 
initiation date; and 
(iv) such other matters as may be specified; 


106 

(b) receive and collate all the claims submitted by creditors 
to him, pursuant to the public announcement made under 
Sections 13 and 15; 
(c) constitute a committee of creditors; 

(d) monitor the assets of the corporate debtor and manage 
its operations until a resolution professional is appointed by 
the committee of creditors; 
(e) file information collected with the information utility, if 
necessary; and 
(f) take control and custody of any asset over which the 
corporate debtor has ownership rights as recorded in the 
balance sheet of the corporate debtor, or with information 
utility or the depository of securities or any other registry 
that records the ownership of assets including-
(i) assets over which the corporate debtor 
has ownership rights which may be located in 
a foreign country; 
(ii) assets that may or may not be in 
possession of the corporate debtor; 
(iii) tangible assets, whether movable or 
immovable; 
(iv) intangible assets including intellectual 
property; 
(v) securities including shares held in any 
subsidiary of the corporate debtor, financial 
instruments, insurance policies; 
(vi) assets subject to the determination of 
ownership by a court or authority; 

(g) to perform such other duties as may be 
specified by the Board. 
Explanation.-For the purposes of this 
section, the term -assets‖ shall not include 
the following, namely-
(a) assets owned by a third party in 
possession of the corporate debtor held 
under 
trust 
or 
under 
contractual 
arrangements including bailment; 


107 

(b) assets of any Indian or foreign subsidiary 
of the corporate debtor; and 
(c) such other assets as may be notified by 
the Central Government in consultation with 
any financial sector regulator.‖ 

59. Under the CIRP Regulations, the resolution professional has to 

vet and verify claims made, and ultimately, determine the amount of 

each claim as follows: 

-10. Substantiation of claims.-The interim 
resolution professional or the resolution professional, 
as the case may be, may call for such other evidence 
or clarification as he deems fit from a creditor for 
substantiating the whole or part of its claim.‖ 

xxx xxx xxx 

-12. Submission of proof of claims.-(1) Subject to 
sub-regulation (2), a creditor shall submit claim with 
proof on or before the last date mentioned in the public 
announcement. 

(2) A creditor, who fails to submit claim with proof 
within the time stipulated in the public announcement, 
may submit the claim with proof to the interim 
resolution professional or the resolution professional, 
as the case may be, on or before the ninetieth day of 
the insolvency commencement date. 
(3) Where the creditor in sub-regulation (2) is a 
financial creditor under regulation 8, it shall be 
included in the committee from the date of admission 
of such claim: 
Provided that such inclusion shall not affect the 
validity of any decision taken by the committee prior to 
such inclusion. 


108 

13. Verification of claims.-(1) The interim resolution 
professional or the resolution professional, as the case 
may be, shall verify every claim, as on the insolvency 
commencement date, within seven days from the last 
date of the receipt of the claims, and thereupon 
maintain a list of creditors containing names of 
creditors along with the amount claimed by them, the 
amount of their claims admitted and the security 
interest, if any, in respect of such claims, and update 
it. 
(2) The list of creditors shall be -

(a) available for inspection by the persons 
who submitted proofs of claim; 
(b) available for inspection by members, 
partners, directors and guarantors of the 
corporate debtor; 
(c) displayed on the website, if any, of the 
corporate debtor; 
(d) filed with the Adjudicating Authority; and 
(e) presented at the first meeting of the 
committee. 

14. Determination of amount of claim.-(1) Where 
the amount claimed by a creditor is not precise due to 
any contingency or other reason, the interim resolution 
professional or the resolution professional, as the case 
may be, shall make the best estimate of the amount of 
the claim based on the information available with him. 
(2) The interim resolution professional or the resolution 
professional, as the case may be, shall revise the 
amounts of claims admitted, including the estimates of 
claims made under sub-regulation (1), as soon as may 
be practicable, when he comes across additional 
information warranting such revision.‖ 

It is clear from a reading of these Regulations that the resolution 

professional is given administrative as opposed to quasi-judicial 


109 

powers. In fact, even when the resolution professional is to make a 

-determination‖ under Regulation 35A, he is only to apply to the 

Adjudicating Authority for appropriate relief based on the determination 

made as follows: 

-35A. Preferential and other transactions.-(1) On 
or before the seventy-fifth day of the insolvency 
commencement date, the resolution professional shall 
form an opinion whether the corporate debtor has 
been subjected to any transaction covered under 
sections 43, 45, 50 or 66. 
(2) Where the resolution professional is of the opinion 
that the corporate debtor has been subjected to any 
transactions covered under sections 43, 45, 50 or 66, 
he shall make a determination on or before the one 
hundred and fifteenth day of the insolvency 
commencement date, under intimation to the Board. 
(3) Where the resolution professional makes a 
determination under sub-regulation (2), he shall apply 
to the Adjudicating Authority for appropriate relief on or 
before the one hundred and thirty-fifth day of the 
insolvency commencement date. 

60. As opposed to this, the liquidator, in liquidation proceedings 

under the Code, has to consolidate and verify the claims, and either 

admit or reject such claims under Sections 38 to 40 of the Code. 

Sections 41 and 42, by way of contrast between the powers of the 

liquidator and that of the resolution professional, are set out 

hereinbelow: 


110 

-41. Determination of valuation of claims.-The 
liquidator shall determine the value of claims admitted 
under Section 40 in such manner as may be specified 
by the Board. 

42. Appeal against the decision of liquidator.-A 
creditor may appeal to the Adjudicating Authority 
against the decision of the liquidator accepting or 
rejecting the claims within fourteen days of the receipt 
of such decision.‖ 

It is clear from these Sections that when the liquidator -determines‖ the 

value of claims admitted under Section 40, such determination is a 

-decision‖, which is quasi-judicial in nature, and which can be appealed 

against to the Adjudicating Authority under Section 42 of the Code. 

61. Unlike the liquidator, the resolution professional cannot act in a 

number of matters without the approval of the committee of creditors 

under Section 28 of the Code, which can, by a two-thirds majority, 

replace one resolution professional with another, in case they are 

unhappy with his performance. Thus, the resolution professional is 

really a facilitator of the resolution process, whose administrative 

functions are overseen by the committee of creditors and by the 

Adjudicating Authority. 

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF SECTION 29A. 


111 

62. Section 29A reads as follows: 

-29A. Persons not eligible to be resolution

made by such creditor has been admitted under 
this Code and such guarantee has been invoked 
by the creditor and remains unpaid in full or part; 
(i) is subject to any disability, corresponding to

the financial sector regulator, notify in this behalf, 
namely-
(a) a scheduled bank; 
(b) any entity regulated by a foreign central 
bank or a securities market regulator or other

(54 of 2002); 
(e) an Alternate Investment Fund registered 
with the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India; 
(f) such categories of persons as may be 
notified by the Central Government.‖ 

63. This Section was first introduced by the Insolvency and 

Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017, which amended the 

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code on 23.11.2017. The Finance Minister 

while moving the Amendment Bill stated as follows: 

-The core and the soul of this new Ordinance is really 
Clause 5, which is Section 29A of the original Bill. I 
may just explain that once a company goes into the 
resolution process, then applications would be invited 
with regard to the potential resolution proposals as far 
as the company is concerned or the enterprise is 
concerned. Now a number of ineligibility clauses were 
not there in the original Act, and, therefore, Clause 
29A introduces those who are not eligible to apply. For 
instance, there is a clause with regard to an 
undischarged insolvent who is not eligible to apply; a 
person who has been disqualified under the 
Companies Act to act as a Director cannot apply; and 
a person who is prohibited under the SEBI Act cannot 


116 

apply. So these are statutory disqualifications. And, 
there is also a disqualification in clause (c) with regard 
to those who are corporate debtors and who, as on the 
date of the application making a bid, do not 
operationalize the account by paying the interest itself, 
i.e., you cannot say that I have an NPA. I am not 
making the account operational. The accounts will 
continue to be NPAs and yet I am going to apply for 
this. Effectively, this clause will mean that those, who 
are in management and on account of whom this 
insolvent or the non-performing asset has arisen, will 
now try and say, I do not discharge any of the 
outstanding debts in terms of making the accounts 
operational, and yet I would like to apply and get the 
same enterprise back at a discounted value, for this is 
not the object of this particular Act itself. So clause 5 
has been brought in with that purpose in mind.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the aforesaid amendment 

states: 

-2. The provisions for insolvency resolution and 
liquidation of a corporate person in the Code did not 
restrict or bar any person from submitting a resolution 
plan or participating in the acquisition process of the 
assets of a company at the time of liquidation. 
Concerns have been raised that persons who, with 
their misconduct contributed to defaults of companies 
or are otherwise undesirable, may misuse this 
situation due to lack of prohibition or restrictions to 
participate in the resolution or liquidation process, and 
gain or regain control of the corporate debtor. This 
may undermine the processes laid down in the Code 
as the unscrupulous person would be seen to be 
rewarded at the expense of creditors. In addition, in 
order to check that the undesirable persons who may 
have submitted their resolution plans in the absence of 


117 

such a provision, responsibility is also being entrusted 
on the committee of creditors to give a reasonable 
period to repay overdue amounts and become 
eligible.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

This Court has held in ArcelorMittal (supra): 

-27. A purposive interpretation of Section 29A, 
depending both on the text and the context in which 
the provision was enacted, must, therefore, inform our 
interpretation of the same. We are concerned in the 
present matter with sub-clauses (c), (f), (i) and (j) 
thereof. 

28. It will be noticed that the opening lines of Section 
29A contained in the Ordinance of 2017 are different 
from the opening lines of Section 29A as contained in 
the Amendment Act of 2017. What is important to note 
is that the phrase -persons acting in concert‖ is 
conspicuous by its absence in the Ordinance of 2017. 
The concepts of -promoter‖, -management‖ and 
-control‖ which were contained in the opening lines of 
Section 29A under the Ordinance have now been 
transferred to sub-clause (c) in the Amendment Act of 
2017. It is, therefore, important to note that the 
Amendment Act of 2017 opens with language which is 
of wider import than that contained in the Ordinance of 
2017, evincing an intention to rope in all persons who 
may be acting in concert with the person submitting a 
resolution plan. 

29. The opening lines of Section 29A of the 
Amendment Act refer to a de facto as opposed to a de 
jure position of the persons mentioned therein. This is 
a typical instance of a -see through provision‖, so that 
one is able to arrive at persons who are actually in 
-control‖, whether jointly, or in concert, with other 
persons. A wooden, literal, interpretation would 


118 

obviously not permit a tearing of the corporate veil 
when it comes to the -person‖ whose eligibility is to be 
gone into. However, a purposeful and contextual 
interpretation, such as is the felt necessity of 
interpretation of such a provision as Section 29A, 
alone governs. For example, it is well settled that a 
shareholder is a separate legal entity from the 
company in which he holds shares. This may be true 
generally speaking, but when it comes to a corporate 
vehicle that is set up for the purpose of submission of 
a resolution plan, it is not only permissible but 
imperative for the competent authority to find out as to 
who are the constituent elements that make up such a 
company. In such cases, the principle laid down 
in Salomon v. A Salomon and Co. Ltd. [1897] AC 
22 will not apply. For it is important to discover in such 
cases as to who are the real individuals or entities who 
are acting jointly or in concert, and who have set up 
such a corporate vehicle for the purpose of submission 
of a resolution plan.‖ 

Similarly in Chitra Sharma v. Union of India, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 

744 of 2017 [decided on 09.08.2018], this Court observed as follows: 

-31. Parliament has introduced Section 29A into the 
IBC with a specific purpose. The provisions of Section 
29A are intended to ensure that among others, 
persons responsible for insolvency of the corporate 
debtor do not participate in the resolution process......‖ 

-32. …… The Court must bear in mind that Section 
29A has been enacted in the larger public interest and 
to facilitate effective corporate governance. Parliament 
rectified a loophole in the Act which allowed a back-
door entry to erstwhile managements in the CIRP. 
Section 30 of the IBC, as amended, also clarifies that 
a resolution plan of a person who is ineligible under 
Section 29A will not be considered by the CoC……‖ 


119 

RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION 

64. It is settled law that a statute is not retrospective merely because 

it affects existing rights; nor is it retrospective merely because a part of 

the requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its 

passing [See State Bank's Staff Union (Madras Circle) v. Union of 

India and Ors., (2005) 7 SCC 584 (at paragraph 21)]. In ArcelorMittal 

(supra), this Court has observed that a resolution applicant has no 

vested right for consideration or approval of its resolution plan as 

follows: 

-79. Take the next stage under Section 30. A 
Resolution Professional has presented a resolution 
plan to the committee of creditors for its approval, but 
the committee of creditors does not approve such plan 
after considering its feasibility and viability, as the 
requisite vote of not less than 66% of the voting share 
of the financial creditors is not obtained. As has been 
mentioned hereinabove, the first proviso to Section 
30(4) furnishes the answer, which is that all that can 
happen at this stage is to require the Resolution 
Professional to invite a fresh resolution plan within the 
time limits specified where no other resolution plan is 
available with him. It is clear that at this stage again no 
application before the Adjudicating Authority could be 
entertained as there is no vested right or fundamental 
right in the resolution applicant to have its resolution 
plan approved, and as no adjudication has yet taken 
place.‖ 


120 

65. This being the case, it is clear that no vested right is taken away 

by application of Section 29A. However, Shri Viswanathan pointed out 

the judgments in Ritesh Agarwal and Anr. v. SEBI and Ors., (2008) 

8 SCC 205 (at paragraph 25), K.S. Paripoornan v. State of Kerala 

and Ors., (1994) 5 SCC 593 (at paragraphs 60-66), Darshan Singh v. 

Ram Pal Singh and Anr., 1992 Supp (1) SCC 191 (at paragraph 35), 

Pyare Lal Sharma v. Managing Director and Ors., (1989) 3 SCC 

448 (at paragraph 21), P.D. Aggarwal and Ors. v. State of U.P. and 

Ors., (1987) 3 SCC 622 (at paragraph 18), and Govind Das and Ors. 

v. Income Tax Officer and Anr., (1976) 1 SCC 906 (at paragraphs 6 

and 11), to argue that if a Section operates on an antecedent set of 

facts, but affects a vested right, it can be held to be retrospective, and 

unless the legislature clearly intends such retrospectivity, the Section 

should not be construed as such. Each of these judgments deals with 

different situations in which penal and other enactments interfere with 

vested rights, as a result of which, they were held to be prospective in 

nature. However, in our judgment in ArcelorMittal (supra), we have 

already held that resolution applicants have no vested right to be 

considered as such in the resolution process. Shri Mukul Rohatgi, 

however, argued that this judgment is distinguishable as no question of 


121 

constitutional validity arose in this case, and no issue as to the vested 

right of a promoter fell for consideration. We are of the view that the 

observations made in ArcelorMittal (supra) directly arose on the facts 

of the case in order to oust the Ruias as promoters from the pale of 

consideration of their resolution plan, in which context, this Court held 

that they had no vested right to be considered as resolution applicants. 

Accordingly, we follow the aforesaid judgment. Since a resolution 

applicant who applies under Section 29A(c) has no vested right to 

apply for being considered as a resolution applicant, this point is of no 

avail. 

SECTION 29A(C) NOT RESTRICTED TO MALFEASANCE 

66. According to learned counsel for the petitioners, Section 29A(c) 

treats unequals as equals. A good erstwhile manager cannot be 

lumped with a bad erstwhile manager. Where an erstwhile manager is 

not guilty of malfeasance or of acting contrary to the interests of the 

corporate debtor, there is no reason why he should not be permitted to 

take part in the resolution process. After all, say the counsel for the 

petitioners, maximization of value of the assets of the corporate debtor 

is an important objective to be achieved by the Code. Keeping out 


122 

good erstwhile managers from the resolution process would go 

contrary to this objective. 

67. This objection by the petitioners was countered by the learned 

Attorney General and Solicitor General, stating that the various clauses 

of Section 29A would show that a person need not be a criminal in 

order to be kept out of the resolution process. For example, under 

Section 29A(a), it is clear that a person may be an undischarged 

insolvent for no fault of his. Equally, under Section 29A(e), a person 

may be disqualified to act as a director under the Companies Act, 

2013, say, where he has not furnished the necessary financial 

statements on time [see Section 164(2)(a) 4 of the Companies Act, 

2013]. 

4 -164. Disqualifications for appointment of director.-
xxx xxx xxx 
(2) No person who is or has been a director of a company which-
(a) has not filed financial statements or annual returns for any continuous 
period of three financial years; or 
(b) has failed to repay the deposits accepted by it or pay interest thereon or 
to redeem any debentures on the due date or pay interest due thereon or 
pay any dividend declared and such failure to pay or redeem continues for 
one year or more, 
shall be eligible to be re-appointed as a director of that company or appointed in 
other company for a period of five years from the date on which the said company 
fails to do so: 
Provided that where a person is appointed as a director of a company which is in 
default of clause (a) or clause (b), he shall not incur the disqualification for a period 
of six months from the date of his appointment. 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 


123 

68. The learned counsel for some of the petitioners have also argued 

that the proviso to Section 35(1)(f) that was added by the Insolvency 

and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2017 [dated 19.01.2018] with 

retrospective effect from 23.11.2017 is manifestly arbitrary and 

violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The proviso to 

Section 35(1)(f) reads as follows: 

-35. Powers and duties of liquidator.-(1) Subject to 
the directions of the Adjudicating Authority, the 
liquidator shall have the following powers and duties, 
namely:-
xxx xxx xxx 

(f) subject to Section 52, to sell the 
immovable and movable property and 
actionable claims of the corporate debtor in 
liquidation by public auction or private 
contract, with power to transfer such property 
to any person or body corporate, or to sell the 
same in parcels in such manner as may be 
specified: 
Provided that the liquidator shall not sell 
the immovable and movable property or 
actionable claims of the corporate debtor in 
liquidation to any person who is not eligible to 
be a resolution applicant. 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 

69. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, when 

immovable and movable property is sold in liquidation, it ought to be 

sold to any person, including persons who are not eligible to be 


124 

resolution applicants as, often, it is the erstwhile promoter who alone 

may purchase such properties piecemeal by public auction or by 

private contract. The same rationale that has been provided earlier in 

this judgment will apply to this proviso as well -there is no vested right 

in an erstwhile promoter of a corporate debtor to bid for the immovable 

and movable property of the corporate debtor in liquidation. Further, 

given the categories of persons who are ineligible under Section 29A, 

which includes persons who are malfeasant, or persons who have 

fallen foul of the law in some way, and persons who are unable to pay 

their debts in the grace period allowed, are further, by this proviso, 

interdicted from purchasing assets of the corporate debtor whose 

debts they have either wilfully not paid or have been unable to pay. 

The legislative purpose which permeates Section 29A continues to 

permeate the Section when it applies not merely to resolution 

applicants, but to liquidation also. Consequently, this plea is also 

rejected. 

THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD IN SECTION 29A(C) AND NPAS 

70. It is clear that Section 29A goes to eligibility to submit a 

resolution plan. A wilful defaulter, in accordance with the guidelines of 


125 

the RBI, would be a person who though able to pay, does not pay. An 

NPA, on the other hand, refers to the account belonging to a person 

that is declared as such under guidelines issued by the RBI. It is 

important at this juncture to advert to the aforesaid guidelines. The 

RBI's Master Circular on Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, 

Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances dated 

01.07.2015 [-RBI Master Circular‖] consolidates instructions issued 

upto 30.06.2015 on NPAs. Clause 2.1 defines NPAs as under: 

-2. DEFINITIONS 

2.1 Non-performing Assets 

2.1.1 An asset, including a leased asset, becomes 
non-performing when it ceases to generate income 
for the bank. 

2.1.2 A non-performing asset (NPA) is a loan or an 
advance where; 

i. 
interest and/ or instalment of principal 
remain overdue for a period of more than 
90 days in respect of a term loan, 
ii. the account remains ‗out of order' as 
indicated at paragraph 2.2 below, in 
respect of an Overdraft/Cash Credit 
(OD/CC), 
iii. the bill remains overdue for a period of 
more than 90 days in the case of bills 
purchased and discounted, 
iv. the instalment of principal or interest 
thereon remains overdue for two crop 
seasons for short duration crops, 


126 

v. the instalment of principal or interest 
thereon remains overdue for one crop 
season for long duration crops, 
vi. the amount of liquidity facility remains 
outstanding for more than 90 days, in 
respect of a securitization transaction 
undertaken in terms of guidelines on 
securitization dated February 1, 2006. 
vii. in respect of derivative transactions, the 
overdue 
receivables 
representing 
positive mark-to-market value of a 
derivative contract, if these remain 
unpaid for a period of 90 days from the 
specified due date for payment. 

2.1.3 In case of interest payments, banks should, 
classify an account as NPA only if the interest due 
and charged during any quarter is not serviced fully 
within 90 days from the end of the quarter. 

2.1.4 In addition, an account may also be classified 
as NPA in terms of paragraph 4.2.4 of this Master 
Circular.‖ 

Clause 4 of the RBI Master Circular deals with asset classification as 

follows: 

-4. ASSET CLASSIFICATION 
4.1 Categories of NPAs 
Banks are required to classify non-performing 
assets further into the following three categories 
based on the period for which the asset has 
remained non-performing and the realisability of 
the dues: 
 Substandard Assets 
 Doubtful Assets 
 Loss Assets 
4.1.1 Substandard Assets 


127 

With effect from March 31, 2005, a substandard 
asset would be one, which has remained NPA for a 
period less than or equal to 12 months. Such an 
asset will have well defined credit weaknesses that 
jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and are 
characterized by the distinct possibility that the 
banks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not 
corrected. 

4.1.2 Doubtful Assets 
With effect from March 31, 2005, an asset would 
be classified as doubtful if it has remained in the 
substandard category for a period of 12 months. A 
loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses 
inherent in assets that were classified as sub-
standard, with the added characteristic that the 
weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full -
on the basis of currently known facts, conditions 
and values -highly questionable and improbable. 

4.1.3 Loss Assets 
A loss asset is one where loss has been identified 
by the bank or internal or external auditors or the 
RBI inspection but the amount has not been written 
off wholly. In other words, such an asset is 
considered uncollectible and of such little value 
that its continuance as a bankable asset is not 
warranted although there may be some salvage or 
recovery value. 

xxx xxx xxx‖ 

71. What is clear from the aforesaid circular is that accounts are 

declared NPA only if defaults made by a corporate debtor are not 

resolved (for example, interest on and/or instalment of the principal 

remaining overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of a 

term loan). Post declaration of such NPA, what is clear is that a 


128 

substandard asset would then be NPA which has remained as such for 

a period of twelve months. In short, a person is a defaulter when an 

instalment and/or interest on the principal remains overdue for more 

than three months, after which, its account is declared NPA. During the 

period of one year thereafter, since it is now classified as a 

substandard asset, this grace period is given to such person to pay off 

the debt. During this grace period, it is clear that such person can bid 

along with other resolution applicants to manage the corporate debtor. 

What is important to bear in mind is also the fact that, prior to this one-

year-three-month period, banks and financial institutions do not declare 

the accounts of corporate debtors to be NPAs. As a matter of practice, 

they first try and resolve disputes with the corporate debtor, after 

which, the corporate debtor's account is declared NPA. As a matter of 

legislative policy therefore, quite apart from malfeasance, if a person is 

unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or in part, within this period of 

one year and three months (which, in any case, is after an earlier 

period where the corporate debtor and its financial creditors sit 

together to resolve defaults that continue), it is stated to be ineligible to 

become a resolution applicant. The reason is not far to see. A person 

who cannot service a debt for the aforesaid period is obviously a 


129 

person who is ailing itself. The saying of Jesus comes to mind --if the 

blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.‖ The legislative policy, 

therefore, is that a person who is unable to service its own debt 

beyond the grace period referred to above, is unfit to be eligible to 

become a resolution applicant. This policy cannot be found fault with. 

Neither can the period of one year be found fault with, as this is a 

policy matter decided by the RBI and which emerges from its Master 

Circular, as during this period, an NPA is classified as a substandard 

asset. The ineligibility attaches only after this one year period is over 

as the NPA now gets classified as a doubtful asset. 

72. The Committee set up by the Government to oversee the 

working of the Code has, in its Report of March 2018, also considered 

this aspect of the matter and has opined as follows: 

-14.8 In regards to the disqualification under clause (c) 
for having an NPA account, it was also stated to the 
Committee that the time period for existence of the 
NPA account must be increased from one year to 
three years. The reason provided was that a downturn 
in a typical business cycle was most likely to extend 
over a year. However, in the absence of any concrete 
data, the Committee felt that there is no conclusive 
way to determine what the ideal time period for 
existence of an NPA should be for the disqualification 
to apply. The Committee felt that the Code was a 
relatively new legislation and therefore, it would be 


130 

prudent to wait and allow industry experience to 
emerge for a few years before any amendment is 
made to the NPA holding period under section 29A(c). 
In relation to applicability of section 29A(c), the 
Committee also discussed that it must be clarified that 
the disqualification pursuant to section 29A(c) shall be 
applicable if such NPA accounts are held by the 
resolution applicant or its connected persons at the 
time of submission of the resolution plan to the RP.‖ 
(emphasis in original) 

RELATED PARTY 

73. A constitutional challenge has been raised against Section 29A(j) 

read with the definition of -related party‖. -Related party‖ is defined in 

the Code as follows:

Explanation.-For the purposes of this clause,-

means anyone who is related to another, in the 
following manner, namely-

(xix) mother's brother and sister, and 
(b) wherever the relation is that of a son, 
daughter, sister or brother, their spouses shall 
also be included;‖ 

74. What is argued by the petitioners is that the mere fact that 

somebody happens to be a relative of an ineligible person cannot be 

good enough to oust such person from becoming a resolution 

applicant, if he is otherwise qualified. We were urged, by Shri 


134 

Viswanathan in particular, to apply the doctrine of nexus that is well 

known and that has been applied by this Court in several judgments in 

other legal contexts, more particularly, in Attorney General for India 

and Ors. v. Amratlal Prajivandas and Ors., (1994) 5 SCC 54. 

Paragraph 44 reads as under: 

-44. It is contended by the counsel for the petitioners 
that extending the provisions of SAFEMA to the 
relatives, associates and other ‗holders' is again a 
case of overreaching or of over-breadth, as it may be 
called -a case of excessive regulation. It is submitted 
that the relatives or associates of a person falling 
under clause (a) or clause (b) of Section 2(2) of 
SAFEMA may have acquired properties of their own, 
may be by illegal means but there is no reason why 
those properties be forfeited under SAFEMA just 
because they are related to or are associates of the 
detenu or convict, as the case may be. It is pointed out 
that the definition of ‗relative' in Explanation (2) and of 
‗associates' in Explanation (3) are so wide as to bring 
in a person even distantly related or associated with 
the convict/detenu, within the net of SAFEMA, and 
once he comes within the net, all his illegally acquired 
properties can be forfeited under the Act. In our 
opinion, the said contention is based upon a 
misconception. SAFEMA is directed towards forfeiture 
of -illegally acquired properties‖ of a person falling 
under clause (a) or clause (b) of Section 2(2). The 
relatives and associates are brought in only for the 
purpose of ensuring that the illegally acquired 
properties of the convict or detenu, acquired or kept in 
their names, do not escape the net of the Act. It is a 
well-known fact that persons indulging in illegal 
activities screen the properties acquired from such 
illegal activity in the names of their relatives and 
associates. Sometimes they transfer such properties 


135 

to them, may be, with an intent to transfer the 
ownership and title. In fact, it is immaterial how such 
relative or associate holds the properties of 
convict/detenu -whether as a benami or as a mere 
name-lender or as a bona fide transferee for value or 
in any other manner. He cannot claim those properties 
and must surrender them to the State under the Act. 
Since he is a relative or associate, as defined by the 
Act, he cannot put forward any defence once it is 
proved that that property was acquired by the detenu 
-whether in his own name or in the name of his 
relatives and associates. It is to counteract the several 
devices that are or may be adopted by persons 
mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 2(2) that 
their relatives and associates mentioned in clauses (c) 
and (d) of the said sub-section are also brought within 
the purview of the Act. The fact of their holding or 
possessing the properties of convict/detenu furnishes 
the link between the convict/detenu and his relatives 
and associates. Only the properties of the 
convict/detenu are sought to be forfeited, wherever 
they are. The idea is to reach his properties in 
whosoever's name they are kept or by whosoever they 
are held. The independent properties of relatives and 
friends, which are not traceable to the convict/detenu, 
are not sought to be forfeited nor are they within the 
purview of SAFEMA [ That this was the object of the 
Act is evident from para 4 of the preamble which 
states: -And whereas such persons have in many 
cases been holding the properties acquired by them 
through such gains in the names of their relatives, 
associates and confidants.‖ We are not saying that the 
preamble can be utilized for restricting the scope of the 
Act, we are only referring to it to ascertain the object of 
the enactment and to reassure ourselves that the 
construction placed by us accords with the said 
object.] . We may proceed to explain what we say. 
Clause (c) speaks of a relative of a person referred to 
in clause (a) or clause (b) (which speak of a convict or 
a detenu). Similarly, clause (d) speaks of associates of 


136 

such convict or detenu. If we look to Explanation (3) 
which specifies who the associates referred to in 
clause (d) are, the matter becomes clearer. 
‗Associates' means -(i) any individual who had been 
or is residing in the residential premises (including 
outhouses) of such person [‗such person' refers to the 
convict or detenu, as the case may be, referred to in 
clause (a) or clause (b)]; (ii) any individual who had 
been or is managing the affairs or keeping the 
accounts of such convict/detenu; (iii) any association 
of persons, body of individuals, partnership firm or 
private company of which such convict/detenu had 
been or is a member, partner or director; (iv) any 
individual who had been or is a member, partner or 
director of an association of persons, body of 
individuals, partnership firm or private company 
referred to in clause (iii) at any time when such person 
had been or is a member, partner or director of such 
association of persons, body of individuals, partnership 
firm or private company; (v) any person who had been 
or is managing the affairs or keeping the accounts of 
any association of persons, body of individuals, 
partnership firm or private company referred to in 
clause (iii); (vi) the trustee of any trust where (a) the 
trust has been created by such convict/detenu; or (b) 
the value of the assets contributed by such 
convict/detenu to the trust amounts, on the date of 
contribution not less than 20% of the value of the 
assets of the trust on that date; and (vii) where the 
competent authority, for reasons to be recorded in 
writing, considers that any properties of such 
convict/detenu are held on his behalf by any other 
person, such other person. It would thus be clear that 
the connecting link or the nexus, as it may be called, is 
the holding of property or assets of the convict/detenu 
or traceable to such detenu/convict. Section 4 is 
equally relevant in this context. It declares that -as 
from the commencement of this Act, it shall not be 
lawful for any person to whom this Act applies to hold 
any illegally acquired property either by himself or 


137 

through any other person on his behalf‖. All such 
property is liable to be forfeited. The language of this 
section is indicative of the ambit of the Act. Clauses (c) 
and (d) in Section 2(2) and the Explanations (2) and 
(3) occurring therein shall have to be construed and 
understood in the light of the overall scheme and 
purpose of the enactment. The idea is to forfeit the 
illegally acquired properties of the convict/detenu 
irrespective of the fact that such properties are held by 
or kept in the name of or screened in the name of any 
relative or associate as defined in the said two 
Explanations. The idea is not to forfeit the independent 
properties of such relatives or associates which they 
may have acquired illegally but only to reach the 
properties of the convict/detenu or properties traceable 
to him, wherever they are, ignoring all the transactions 
with respect to those properties. By way of illustration, 
take a case where a convict/detenu purchases a 
property in the name of his relative or associate -it 
does not matter whether he intends such a person to 
be a mere name-lender or whether he really intends 
that such person shall be the real owner and/or 
possessor thereof -or gifts away or otherwise 
transfers his properties in favour of any of his relatives 
or associates, or purports to sell them to any of his 
relatives or associates -in all such cases, all the said 
transactions will be ignored and the properties forfeited 
unless the convict/detenu or his relative/associate, as 
the case may be, establishes that such property or 
properties are not -illegally acquired properties‖ within 
the meaning of Section 3(c). In this view of the matter, 
there is no basis for the apprehension that the 
independently acquired properties of such relatives 
and associates will also be forfeited even if they are in 
no way connected with the convict/detenu. So far as 
the holders (not being relatives and associates) 
mentioned in Section 2(2)(e) are concerned, they are 
dealt with on a separate footing. If such person proves 
that he is a transferee in good faith for consideration, 
his property -even though purchased from a 


138 

convict/detenu -is not liable to be forfeited. It is 
equally necessary to reiterate that the burden of 
establishing that the properties mentioned in the show-
cause notice issued under Section 6, and which are 
held on that date by a relative or an associate of the 
convict/detenu, are not the illegally acquired properties 
of 
the 
convict/detenu, 
lies 
upon 
such 
relative/associate. He must establish that the said 
property has not been acquired with the monies or 
assets provided by the detenu/convict or that they in 
fact did not or do not belong to such detenu/convict. 
We do not think that Parliament ever intended to say 
that the properties of all the relatives and associates, 
may be illegally acquired, will be forfeited just because 
they happen to be the relatives or associates of the 
convict/detenu. There ought to be the connecting link 
between those properties and the convict/detenu, the 
burden of disproving which, as mentioned above, is 
upon the relative/associate. In this view of the matter, 
the apprehension and contention of the petitioners in 
this behalf must be held to be based upon a mistaken 
premise. The bringing in of the relatives and 
associates or of the persons mentioned in clause (e) of 
Section 2(2) is thus neither discriminatory nor 
incompetent apart from the protection of Article 31-B.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

75. We are of the view that persons who act jointly or in concert with 

others are connected with the business activity of the resolution 

applicant. Similarly, all the categories of persons mentioned in Section 

5(24A) show that such persons must be -connected‖ with the 

resolution applicant within the meaning of Section 29A(j). This being 

the case, the said categories of persons who are collectively 


139 

mentioned under the caption -relative‖ obviously need to have a 

connection with the business activity of the resolution applicant. In the 

absence of showing that such person is -connected‖ with the business 

of the activity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly 

be disqualified under Section 29A(j). All the categories in Section 

29A(j) deal with persons, natural as well as artificial, who are 

connected with the business activity of the resolution applicant. The 

expression -related party‖, therefore, and -relative‖ contained in the 

definition Sections must be read noscitur a sociis with the categories of 

persons mentioned in Explanation I, and so read, would include only 

persons who are connected with the business activity of the resolution 

applicant. 

76. An argument was also made that the expression -connected 

person‖ in Explanation I, clause (ii) to Section 29A(j) cannot possibly 

refer to a person who may be in management or control of the 

business of the corporate debtor in future. This would be arbitrary as 

the explanation would then apply to an indeterminate person. This 

contention also needs to be repelled as Explanation I seeks to make it 

clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a -connected person‖, 

this provision would also cover a person who is in management or 


140 

control of the business of the corporate debtor during the 

implementation of a resolution plan. Therefore, any such person is not 

indeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of the 

business of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of time or 

even during implementation of the resolution plan. This disposes of all 

the contentions raising questions as to the constitutional validity of 

Section 29A(j). 

EXEMPTION OF MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES FROM SECTION 

29A 

77. The ILC Report of March 2018 found that micro, small, and 

medium enterprises form the foundation of the economy and are key 

drivers 
of 
employment, 
production, 
economic 
growth, 

entrepreneurship, and financial inclusion. 

78. Section 7 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 

Development Act, 2006 classifies enterprises depending upon whether 

they manufacture or produce goods, or are engaged in providing and 

rendering services as micro, small, or medium, depending upon certain 

investments made, as follows: 


141 

-7. 
Classification 
of 
enterprises.-(1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 11-B of 
the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 
1951 (65 of 1951), the Central Government may, for 
the purposes of this Act, by notification and having 
regard to the provisions of sub-sections (4) and (5), 
classify any class or classes of enterprises, whether 
proprietorship, Hindu undivided family, associations of 
persons, co-operative society, partnership firm, 
company or undertaking, by whatever name called,-

(a) in the case of the enterprises engaged in the 
manufacture or production of goods pertaining to 
any industry specified in the First Schedule to the 
Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 
1951 (65 of 1951), as-
(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment 
in plant and machinery does not exceed 
twenty-five lakh rupees; 
(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment 
in plant and machinery is more than twenty-
five lakh rupees but does not exceed five 
crore rupees; or 
(iii) a medium enterprise, where the 
investment in plant and machinery is more 
than five crore rupees but does not exceed 
ten crore rupees; 

(b) in the case of the enterprises engaged in 
providing or rendering of services, as-
(i) a micro enterprise, where the investment 
in equipment does not exceed ten lakh 
rupees; 
(ii) a small enterprise, where the investment 
in equipment is more than ten lakh rupees 
but does not exceed two crore rupees; or 
(iii) a medium enterprise, where the 
investment in equipment is more than two 
crore rupees but does not exceed five crore 
rupees. 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 


142 

79. The ILC Report of 2018 exempted these industries from Section 

29A(c) and 29A(h) of the Code, their rationale for doing so being 

contained in paragraph 27.4 of the Report, which reads as follows: 

-27.4 Regarding the first issue, the Code is clear that 
default of INR one lakh or above triggers the right of a 
financial creditor or an operational creditor to file for 
insolvency. Thus, the financial creditor or operational 
creditors of MSMEs may take it to insolvency under 
the Code. However, given that MSMEs are the 
bedrock of the Indian economy, and the intent is not to 
push them into liquidation and affect the livelihood of 
employees and workers of MSMEs, the Committee 
sought it fit to explicitly grant exemptions to corporate 
debtors which are MSMEs by permitting a promoter 
who is not a wilful defaulter, to bid for the MSME in 
insolvency. The rationale for this relaxation is that a 
business of an MSME attracts interest primarily from a 
promoter of an MSME and may not be of interest to 
other resolution applicants.‖ 
(emphasis supplied) 

80. Thus, the rationale for excluding such industries from the 

eligibility criteria laid down in Section 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because 

qua such industries, other resolution applicants may not be 

forthcoming, which then will inevitably lead not to resolution, but to 

liquidation. Following upon the Insolvency Law Committee's Report, 

Section 240A has been inserted in the Code with retrospective effect 

from 06.06.2018 as follows: 


143 

-240-A. Application of this Code to micro, small 
and medium enterprises.-(1) Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in this Code, the 
provisions of clauses (c) and (h) of Section 29A shall 
not apply to the resolution applicant in respect of 
corporate insolvency resolution process of any micro, 
small and medium enterprises. 
(2) Subject to sub-section (1), the Central Government 
may, in the public interest, by notification, direct that 
any of the provisions of this Code shall-
(a) not apply to micro, small and medium 
enterprises; or 
(b) apply to micro, small and medium 
enterprises, with such modifications as may 
be specified in the notification. 
(3) A draft of every notification proposed to be issued 
under sub-section (2), shall be laid before each House 
of Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of 
thirty days which may be comprised in one session or 
in two or more successive sessions. 
(4) If both Houses agree in disapproving the issue of 
notification or both Houses agree in making any 
modification in the notification, the notification shall not 
be issued or shall be issued only in such modified form 
as may be agreed upon by both the Houses, as the 
case may be. 
(5) The period of thirty days referred to in sub-section 
(3) shall not include any period during which the 
House referred to in sub-section (4) is prorogued or 
adjourned for more than four consecutive days. 
(6) Every notification issued under this section shall be 
laid, as soon as may be after it is issued, before each 
House of Parliament. 
Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, the 
expression -micro, small and medium enterprises‖ 
means any class or classes of enterprises classified as 
such under sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 
(27 of 2006).‖ 


144 

81. It can thus be seen that when the Code has worked hardship to a 

class of enterprises, the Committee constituted by the Government, in 

overseeing the working of the Code, has been alive to such problems, 

and the Government in turn has followed the recommendations of the 

Committee in enacting Section 240A. This is an important instance of 

how the executive continues to monitor the application of the Code, 

and exempts a class of enterprises from the application of some of its 

provisions in deserving cases. This and other amendments that are 

repeatedly being made to the Code, and to subordinate legislation 

made thereunder, based upon Committee Reports which are looking 

into the working of the Code, would also show that the legislature is 

alive to serious anomalies that arise in the working of the Code and 

steps in to rectify them. 

SECTION 53 OF THE CODE DOES NOT VIOLATE ARTICLE 14. 

82. An argument has been made by counsel appearing on behalf of 

the petitioners that in the event of liquidation, operational creditors will 

never get anything as they rank below all other creditors, including 

other unsecured creditors who happen to be financial creditors. This, 

according to them, would render Section 53 and in particular, Section 


145 

53(1)(f) discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary and thus, violative of 

Article 14 of the Constitution of India. 

Section 53(1) reads as follows: 

-53. Distribution of assets.-(1) Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in any law enacted 
by the Parliament or any State Legislature for the time 
being in force, the proceeds from the sale of the 
liquidation assets shall be distributed in the following 
order of priority and within such period and in such 
manner as may be specified, namely-
(a) the insolvency resolution process costs and 
the liquidation costs paid in full; 
(b) the following debts which shall rank equally 
between and among the following-
(i) workmen's dues for the period of twenty-
four months preceding the liquidation 
commencement date; and 
(ii) debts owed to a secured creditor in the 
event such secured creditor has relinquished 
security in the manner set out in Section 52; 
(c) wages and any unpaid dues owed to 
employees other than workmen for the period of 
twelve months preceding the liquidation 
commencement date; 
(d) financial debts owed to unsecured creditors; 
(e) the following dues shall rank equally between 
and among the following:-
(i) any amount due to the Central 
Government and the State Government 
including the amount to be received on 
account of the Consolidated Fund of India 
and the Consolidated Fund of a State, if any, 
in respect of the whole or any part of the 
period of two years preceding the liquidation 
commencement date; 


146 

(ii) debts owed to a secured creditor for any 
amount unpaid following the enforcement of 
security interest; 
(f) any remaining debts and dues; 
(g) preference shareholders, if any; and 
(h) equity shareholders or partners, as the case 
may be. 
xxx xxx xxx‖ 

83. The BLRC Report, which led to the enactment of the Insolvency 

Code, in dealing with this aspect of the matter, has stated: 

-The Committee has recommended to keep the right of 
the Central and State Government in the distribution 
waterfall in liquidation at a priority below the unsecured 
financial creditors in addition to all kinds of secured 
creditors for promoting the availability of credit and 
developing a market for unsecured financing (including 
the development of bond markets). In the long run, this 
would increase the availability of finance, reduce the 
cost of capital, promote entrepreneurship and lead to 
faster economic growth. The government also will be 
the beneficiary of this process as economic growth will 
increase revenues. Further, efficiency enhancement 
and consequent greater value capture through the 
proposed insolvency regime will bring in additional 
gains to both the economy and the exchequer.‖ 

xxx xxx xxx 

-For the remaining creditors who participate in the 
collective action of Liquidation, the Committee debated 
on the waterfall of liabilities that should hold in 
Liquidation in the new Code. Across different 
jurisdictions, the observation is that secured creditors 
have first priority on the realizations, and that these 
are typically paid out net of the costs of insolvency 
resolution and Liquidation. In order to bring the 
practices in India in-line with the global practice, and to 


147 

ensure that the objectives of this proposed Code is 
met, the Committee recommends that the waterfall in 
Liquidation should be as follows: 

1. Costs of IRP and liquidation. 
2. Secured creditors and Workmen dues capped 
up to three months from the start of IRP. 
3. Employees capped up to three months. 
4. Dues to unsecured financial creditors, debts 
payable to workmen in respect of the period 
beginning twelve months before the liquidation 
commencement date and ending three months 
before the liquidation commencement date; 
5. Any amount due to the State Government and 
the Central Government in respect of the whole or 
any part of the period of two years before the 
liquidation commencement date; any debts of the 
secured creditor for any amount unpaid following 
the enforcement of security interest 
6. Remaining debt 
7. Surplus to shareholders.‖ 

84. It will be seen that the reason for differentiating between financial 

debts, which are secured, and operational debts, which are unsecured, 

is in the relative importance of the two types of debts when it comes to 

the object sought to be achieved by the Insolvency Code. We have 

already seen that repayment of financial debts infuses capital into the 

economy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able, with 

the money that has been paid back, to further lend such money to 

other entrepreneurs for their businesses. This rationale creates an 

intelligible differentia between financial debts and operational debts, 


148 

which are unsecured, which is directly related to the object sought to 

be achieved by the Code. In any case, workmen's dues, which are also 

unsecured debts, have traditionally been placed above most other 

debts. Thus, it can be seen that unsecured debts are of various kinds, 

and so long as there is some legitimate interest sought to be protected, 

having relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in 

question, Article 14 does not get infracted. For these reasons, the 

challenge to Section 53 of the Code must also fail. 

EPILOGUE 

85. The Insolvency Code is a legislation which deals with economic 

matters and, in the larger sense, deals with the economy of the country 

as a whole. Earlier experiments, as we have seen, in terms of 

legislations having failed, ‗trial' having led to repeated ‗errors', 

ultimately led to the enactment of the Code. The experiment contained 

in the Code, judged by the generality of its provisions and not by so-

called crudities and inequities that have been pointed out by the 

petitioners, passes constitutional muster. To stay experimentation in 

things economic is a grave responsibility, and denial of the right to 

experiment is fraught with serious consequences to the nation. We 

have also seen that the working of the Code is being monitored by the 


149 

Central Government by Expert Committees that have been set up in 

this behalf. Amendments have been made in the short period in which 

the Code has operated, both to the Code itself as well as to 

subordinate legislation made under it. This process is an ongoing 

process which involves all stakeholders, including the petitioners. 

86. We are happy to note that in the working of the Code, the flow of 

financial resource to the commercial sector in India has increased 

exponentially as a result of financial debts being repaid. Approximately 

3300 cases have been disposed of by the Adjudicating Authority based 

on out-of-court settlements between corporate debtors and creditors 

which themselves involved claims amounting to over INR 1,20,390 

crores. Eighty cases have since been resolved by resolution plans 

being accepted. Of these eighty cases, the liquidation value of sixty-

three such cases is INR 29,788.07 crores. However, the amount 

realized from the resolution process is in the region of INR 60,000 

crores, which is over 202% of the liquidation value. As a result of this, 

the Reserve Bank of India has come out with figures which reflect 

these results. Thus, credit that has been given by banks and financial 

institutions to the commercial sector (other than food) has jumped up 

from INR 4952.24 crores in 2016-2017, to INR 9161.09 crores in 2017-


150 

2018, and to INR 13195.20 crores for the first six months of 2018-

2019. Equally, credit flow from non-banks has gone up from INR 

6819.93 crores in 2016-2017, to INR 4718 crores for the first six 

months of 2018-2019. Ultimately, the total flow of resources to the 

commercial sector in India, both bank and non-bank, and domestic and 

foreign (relatable to the non-food sector) has gone up from a total of 

INR 14530.47 crores in 2016-2017, to INR 18469.25 crores in 2017-

2018, and to INR 18798.20 crores in the first six months of 2018-2019. 

These figures show that the experiment conducted in enacting the 

Code is proving to be largely successful. The defaulter's paradise is 

lost. In its place, the economy's rightful position has been regained. 

The result is that all the petitions will now be disposed of in terms of 

this judgment. There will be no order as to costs.
