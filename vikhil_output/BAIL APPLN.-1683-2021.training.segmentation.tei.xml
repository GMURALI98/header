			<body>f) The last of the bail application, filed by the petitioners, was <lb/>dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-04, Tis <lb/>Hazari Courts on 07.05.2021. <lb/>g) Thereafter, the petitioners have approached this Court by filing <lb/>the instant petition. <lb/>3. <lb/>The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the petitioners <lb/>have been in custody since 21.07.2016. He states that out of 23 witnesses, 19 <lb/>witnesses have been examined. He further states that the entire case of the <lb/>prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence. He contends that the <lb/>petitioners were released on interim bail under the HPC Guidelines and the <lb/>interim bail was extended. The Supreme Court by an order dated 19.03.2021 <lb/>in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.13021/12020 titled as National Forum on <lb/>Prison Reforms v. Govemment of NCT of Delhi &amp; Ors, directed the under <lb/>trials to surrender. He states that both the petitioners surrendered in April <lb/>2021. It is stated that they have not abused the interim bail granted to them. <lb/>He further contends that even if the facts of the prosecution are admitted in <lb/>its entirety then also, at best, only a case under Section 304 Part II IPC is <lb/>made out against the petitioners and since the petitioners have already been <lb/>in custody for more than six years now, the petitioners ought to be released <lb/>on bail. <lb/>4. <lb/>Per contra, Mr. Amit Chadha, learned APP for the State, vehemently <lb/>opposes the bail by contending that Nidhu Devi (petitioner in BAIL APPLN. <lb/>1683/2021) was already married. She had an extra marital affair with the <lb/>petitioner in BAIL APPLN. 1684/2021. He states that both the petitioners <lb/>were living together at D-147/147, DDA Colony, Khyala, Delhi and later <lb/>they shifted to House No. N-153, Gali No.3, Vishnu Garden, Delhi. He <lb/></body>

			<body>states that only with the motive of eliminating the deceased, Nidhu Devi (the <lb/>petitioner in BAIL APPLN. 1683/2021) went to his native village and <lb/>brought the deceased to her house and then both the petitioners eliminated <lb/>him. The learned APP for the State submits that PW-3 has stated that both <lb/>the petitioners were living on the third floor of his house and the deceased <lb/>started living in the same home after some time. He states that PW-3 has <lb/>categorically stated that on 21.07.2016, he heard some noise and when he <lb/>went to the room of the petitioners, he saw Nidhu Devi was cleaning the <lb/>floor, which had blood on it, and Sanjay Kumar Sahu was standing there and <lb/>the victim was lying on the floor and was breathing heavily. He further <lb/>stated that he called an e-rickshaw and sent the victim and the petitioners to <lb/>the Hospital in the e-rickshaw. <lb/>5. <lb/>Heard Mr. F. K. Jha, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Amit <lb/>Chadha, learned APP for the State and perused the material on record. <lb/>6. <lb/>The petitioners are accused of an offence punishable under Section <lb/>302 IPC. The deceased was the husband of Nidhu Devi (petitioner in BAIL <lb/>APPLN. 1683/2021). The deceased and the petitioners were living in the <lb/>same house. The petitioners brought the body of the deceased to the <lb/>hospital. They have been identified by the Head Constable Mahavir. <lb/>7. <lb/>A perusal of the deposition of PW-1, Sunil Kumar Thakur, who is the <lb/>brother of the deceased, shows that the deceased and Nidhu Devi (petitioner <lb/>in BAIL APPLN. 1683/2021) got married in 1999 and they have two <lb/>children. He stated that about 6-7 months prior to the incident, Nidhu Devi <lb/>had gone to her parental house from where she ran away. It is stated that <lb/>after 2-3 months, Nidhu Devi returned to her parental house and said that <lb/>she was working at some factory in Delhi during her absence from her <lb/></body>

			<body>parental house. He further stated that about 10-15 days prior to the incident, <lb/>Nidhu Devi went to his native village and brought the deceased with her on <lb/>the pretext of getting him employment in Delhi. He further stated that Nidhu <lb/>Devi told them that once they get settled they will also bring their children <lb/>to Delhi. He stated that in the evening of 21.07.2016, information was <lb/>received that his brother has been murdered. He stated that he came to Delhi <lb/>and identified the dead body of his brother in the mortuary of DDU hospital. <lb/>8. <lb/>PW-3, Laxman Singh, is the land lord of the house where the <lb/>petitioners and the deceased were staying. In his statement, he stated that his <lb/>house is situated in a three floor building and he resides on the ground floor <lb/>with his family. He stated that on the first floor of the building there are <lb/>three rooms in which tenants reside. He further stated that on the second <lb/>floor there are three rooms which are also let out. He stated that on the roof <lb/>of second floor there are two rooms having tin roofs. He stated that the <lb/>petitioners and the deceased were living in one of the rooms on the third <lb/>floor. He stated that on 21.07.2016, at about 4.30 PM, he heard a noise from <lb/>the roof and when he went there he saw Nidhu Devi was washing the floor <lb/>of the room. He stated that Nidhu Devi was washing the blood lying on the <lb/>floor with water. It is stated that when he enquired, he was informed that a <lb/>quarrel took place between the petitioners and the deceased. He stated that <lb/>the deceased was lying on the floor and he was heavily breathing. He stated <lb/>that he immediately called a battery rickshaw which was passing from the <lb/>street and sent the petitioners and the deceased to the hospital for treatment <lb/>of the deceased. He stated that he later on came to know that the deceased <lb/>had passed away. <lb/></body>

			<body>9. <lb/>The prosecution also examined PW-4, Mohan Shyam, who was the <lb/>erstwhile land lord of the petitioner. He also identified the petitioners and <lb/>stated that they were staying at his house as tenants. He stated that the <lb/>petitioners lived in his house for about 3-4 months and then they vacated the <lb/>premises. In the Cross-examination, he stated that Sanjay Kumar Sahu <lb/>(petitioner in BAIL APPLN. 1684/2021) first approached him for taking the <lb/>premises on rent and started residing there and after 3-4 days Nidhu Devi <lb/>(petitioner in BAIL APPLN. 1683/2021) joined him and both of them <lb/>started living together. <lb/>10. The factors which have to be kept in mind while considering an <lb/>application for bail are: <lb/>a. whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground <lb/>to believe that the accused had committed the offence; <lb/>b. nature and gravity of the accusation; <lb/>c. severity of the punishment in the event of conviction; <lb/>d. danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if <lb/>released on bail; <lb/>e. character, behaviour, means, position and standing of <lb/>the accused; <lb/>f. likelihood of the offence being repeated; <lb/>g. reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being <lb/>influenced; and <lb/>h. danger, of course, of justice being thwarted by grant of <lb/>bail. <lb/></body>

			<body>11. Even though most of the prosecution witnesses have been examined <lb/>but the petitioners are accused of a very serious offence. Though at the stage <lb/>of bail, the Court need not conduct a mini trial but the heinousness of the <lb/>offence is one of the important and relevant factors while considering as to <lb/>whether bail should be granted or not. The material on record reveals that <lb/>Nidhu Devi (petitioner in BAIL APPLN.1683/2021), who was already <lb/>married to the deceased was living with Sanjay Kumar Sahu (petitioner in <lb/>BAIL APPLN.1684/2021) and they were residing at D-147/147, DDA <lb/>Colony, Khyala, Delhi and later they moved to House No.N-153, Gali NO.8, <lb/>Vishnu Garden, New Delhi. Nidhu Devi went back to the native village of <lb/>the deceased and brought him with her on the pretext of employment and <lb/>then the incident took place on the fateful day. Looking at the gravity of the <lb/>offence, the nature of injuries, the manner in which the incident took place <lb/>and the fact that the petitioners do not reside in Delhi and the chances of <lb/>their absconding are high, this Court is not inclined to grant bail to the <lb/>petitioners at this juncture. <lb/>12. Accordingly, the bail applications are dismissed along with the <lb/>pending application(s), if any. <lb/>13. The Trial Court is directed to expedite the trial and conclude the same <lb/>within a period of eight months. <lb/>14. It is made clear that the observations made in this order are not on the <lb/>merits of the case. <lb/>SUBRAMONIUM PRASAD, J <lb/>OCTOBER 21, 2021 <lb/>Rahul </body>
