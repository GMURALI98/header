			<body>3. Whether judgment should be reported in Digest? <lb/>ORDER <lb/>1. <lb/>By this order, I shall dispose of above two applications for anticipatory <lb/>bail/bail made by the applicant/accused person. The applicant/accused have <lb/>been named by parents of the deceased in offence under Sections 304-B, 498-<lb/>Page 2 of 5 <lb/>A IPC. The deceased had committed suicide at her in-laws house and after her <lb/>suicide on the basis of statement of her parents, an FIR under Section 304-B <lb/>and 498-A IPC was registered against in-laws of the deceased. <lb/>2. <lb/>A perusal of the statements made by the father, mother and brother of <lb/>the deceased to I.O as well as to the SDM would show that all of them <lb/>consistently stated that the in-laws were not allowing their daughter/sister to <lb/>come to their house or to telephone them and they had not no contact with <lb/>the daughter. However, mother of the deceased made statement that about <lb/>one and half month prior to the incident while her daughter was going to <lb/>dispensary to take medicine for her son, aged about nine and a half months, <lb/>she had met her on the way and she complained to her that her mother-in-<lb/>law, her husband and husband&apos;s brother used to harass her and threaten her <lb/>not to meet her parents neither her parents should come to meet her and if <lb/>they had come, they would be killed and they used to taunt her for bringing <lb/>less dowry. She alleged a second chance meeting about 4-5 days before the <lb/>incident and repeated the same complaint having been made by her daughter. <lb/>The brother of the deceased in his statement has stated that his sister had <lb/>met him only once after marriage i.e. on the day of Raksha Bandhan and on <lb/>that day, her husband had come and quarreled with him and taken her back <lb/>without tying Rakhi. Her in-laws did not allow her to make a phone call and <lb/>were not allowing her to come to their house. It was only after two and a half <lb/>Page 3 of 5 <lb/>year that news was received that his sister used to be under pressure and was <lb/>being harassed. The statement of father shows that he had gone to her <lb/>daughter&apos;s house on one occasion before Raksha Bandhan with 20 kg of <lb/>&apos;Jalebi&apos; and on another occasion at the time of some &quot;Jagaran&quot; with &apos;Mathees&apos; <lb/>but mother-in-law of the deceased threw away these things and shown <lb/>dissatisfaction. Her daughter was not allowed to make a telephone call nor <lb/>allowed to meet them. No message was received to him from his daughter. All <lb/>these three witnesses despite saying that the deceased was neither talking to <lb/>them nor meeting them made allegation of dowry demand by the in-laws, <lb/>without disclosing the source as to who told them about the dowry demand <lb/>by the in-laws. The chance meeting as described by the mother of the <lb/>deceased seems to have been introduced, because these chance meeting <lb/>have been shown just before the death. It is a fact that houses of parents of <lb/>the girl and in-laws were not at far off places. While parents were living at F-<lb/>662, Mangol Puri, Delhi, the in-laws were living at E-594, Mangol Puri, Delhi. <lb/>Thus, the two families were living at two adjoining blocks of Mangol Puri. It is <lb/>submitted by counsel for the applicant that the marriage between the <lb/>husband and the wife was a love marriage and parents of the girl were not <lb/>happy with the marriage and that was the reason that the girl was not being <lb/>allowed by the parents themselves to meet them. <lb/>Page 4 of 5 <lb/>3. <lb/>The learned counsel for the State has submitted that there was no <lb/>evidence to show that it was love marriage. It was an arranged marriage as <lb/>per the statement of the father of the deceased at the time of marriage also <lb/>dowry requests were given. <lb/>4. <lb/>The parents of the deceased were living in the adjoining block. Even if <lb/>their daughter was not being allowed to meet them or telephone them, they <lb/>could easily have gone to the house of the deceased any number of times and <lb/>had there been incidents of cruelty or complaints of dowry demand, they <lb/>would have made a complaint or lodged the report. It is also undisputed that <lb/>the deceased was having a child of around nine month&apos;s age. It is not even <lb/>stated that at the time of birth of the child, the parents of the girl visited her <lb/>or called her to their home or there was any mis-treatment at the time of <lb/>birth of the child before that. I, therefore, consider that the allegations made <lb/>by the parents of the girl against in-laws regarding the harassment due to <lb/>dowry etc. as learnt from the deceased on these two alleged chance meeting <lb/>cannot be believed on face value, unless they are tested during the evidence <lb/>and I consider it is a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant who <lb/>is jeth of the deceased and bail to other applicant, who is mother-in-law of the <lb/>deceased. <lb/>Page 5 of 5 <lb/>5. <lb/>The applications are allowed. It is directed that in case the applicant <lb/>Rajesh is arrested, he be released on executing personal bond of Rs.25,000/-<lb/>with one surety of like amount to the satisfaction of SHO/Arresting Officer <lb/>concerned. The applicant Lajjawati, who is in judicial custody be released by <lb/>trial Court on her executing personal bond of Rs.25,000/-with one surety of <lb/>the like amount. <lb/>November 11, 2010 <lb/>SHIV NARAYAN DHINGRA, J. <lb/>rs </body>
