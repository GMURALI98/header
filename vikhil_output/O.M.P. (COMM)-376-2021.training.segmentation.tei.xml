Petitioner <lb/>Through: Ms Padma Priya and Ms Shreya <lb/>Sethi, Advocates. <lb/>versus <lb/>SOWiL LIMITED <lb/>Through: Ms Manmeet Arora, Ms Pavitra <lb/>Kaur and Mr Kartikeya Sharma, <lb/>Advocates. <lb/>CORAM: <lb/>HON&apos;BLE MR. JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU <lb/>VIBHU BAKHRU, J. (ORAL) <lb/>1. <lb/>The petitioner (hereafter &apos;IHMCL&apos;) has filed the present petition <lb/>under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 <lb/>(hereafter &apos;the A&amp;C Act&apos;) impugning an arbitral award dated <lb/>11.10.2021 (hereafter &apos;the impugned award&apos;) rendered by an Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal constituted by Justice (Retired) Badar Durrez Ahmed as the <lb/>Sole Arbitrator (hereafter &apos;the Arbitral Tribunal&apos;). <lb/>2. <lb/>The Arbitral Tribunal has rendered the impugned award in the <lb/>context of disputes that have arisen between the parties in relation to a <lb/>contract dated 28.10.2014 for &quot;Conducting Traffic Surveys on National <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/>Digitally Signed <lb/>By:DUSHYANT <lb/>RAWAL <lb/>Signature Not Verified <lb/></front>

			<body>Highways in Zone-5 (in the States of Odisha, West Bengal and North <lb/>Eastern States) using Portable Automatic Traffic Counter &amp; Classified <lb/>(ATCC) Systems&quot; (hereafter &apos;the Contract&apos;). <lb/>Factual Context <lb/>3. <lb/>The respondent (hereafter &apos;SOWiL&apos;) is a small enterprise under <lb/>the Micro, Small, Medium Enterprise Development Act, 2006 <lb/>(hereafter &apos;the MSMED Act&apos;) and is, inter alia, engaged in the business <lb/>of providing consultancy services to various organizations for <lb/>development works, railway works, bridges, structures and tunnelling. <lb/>4. <lb/>IHMCL is a public limited company incorporated under the <lb/>Companies Act, 1956 and provides services in relation to management <lb/>of toll collection on National Highways through electronic toll systems; <lb/>assessment of the volume of traffic; and collection of data through <lb/>traffic surveys using portable Automatic Traffic Counter-cum-<lb/>Classifiers (ATCC). <lb/>5. <lb/>The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (hereafter <lb/>&apos;MORTH&apos;) had instructed IHMCL to conduct traffic surveys on the <lb/>National Highways in India. Accordingly, on 13.05.2015, IHMCL <lb/>issued a Request for Proposal (hereafter &apos;2014 RFP&apos;) inviting bids for <lb/>conducting traffic surveys using portable ATCC in seven zones on the <lb/>National Highways in India (hereafter &apos;the Project&apos;). SOWiL <lb/>participated in the bid for Zone-5 and was declared as the successful <lb/>bidder. <lb/></body>

			<body>6. <lb/>IHMCL issued a Letter of Award (hereafter &apos;LOA&apos;) to SOWiL <lb/>on 13.08.2014. Consequently, on 28.10.2014, the parties entered into <lb/>the Contract in respect of the aforesaid Project, for a contract value of <lb/>â‚¹68,03,80,000/-. In terms of the Contract, SOWiL agreed to conduct <lb/>traffic surveys twice a year for a period of five years, at the specified <lb/>locations. <lb/>7. <lb/>SOWiL claims that, during the term of the Contract, IHMCL <lb/>issued another RFP on 08.03.2018 bearing no. IHMCL/Portable-<lb/>ATCC/March/2018 (hereafter &apos;the 2018 RFP&apos;) and invited bids on a <lb/>&apos;Price Discovery Mechanism&apos; for the balance works being carried out <lb/>by SOWiL in Zone-5. Thereafter, IHMCL expressed its intention to <lb/>terminate the Contract in terms of Article 12.2 of the Contract. <lb/>8. <lb/>It is SOWiL&apos;s case that IHMCL&apos;s proposed invocation of Article <lb/>12.2 of the Contract to terminate the Contract during its tenure, for <lb/>convenience, is a breach of the terms of the Contract. IHMCL countered <lb/>the same and stated that an exercise of price discovery is not a breach <lb/>of the Contract. It further contended that the prices under the 2014 RFP <lb/>were higher and thus, it intended to award the remaining four rounds at <lb/>a lower rate to save public money. <lb/>9. <lb/>Aggrieved by the same, SOWiL filed a petition before this Court <lb/>under Section 9 of the A&amp;C Act [being OMP (I) (COMM) 169/2018] <lb/>and by an order dated 19.04.2018, this Court restrained IHMCL from <lb/>terminating the Contract. This Court, by an order dated 24.04.2018, <lb/>further restrained IHMCL from awarding contracts pursuant to the 2018 <lb/></body>

			<body>RFP to any third party in respect of the locations that were awarded to <lb/>SOWiL. <lb/>10. On 10.08.2018, SOWiL filed a petition under Section 11 of the <lb/>A&amp;C Act [being Arb. P. 593/2018] and this Court, by an order dated <lb/>30.10.2018, constituted the Arbitral Tribunal. This Court also disposed <lb/>of the petition under Section 9 of the A&amp;C Act with the direction that <lb/>&quot;the petitioner (SOWiL) shall continue to work on the sites that were <lb/>already allocated to it in terms of the contract between the parties, <lb/>however, shall be paid in accordance with L-1 rates that have been <lb/>received by the respondent (IHMCL) in the new tender process. The <lb/>respondent shall be entitled to raise the claim of the differential amount <lb/>and such other claims that it may have before the Arbitrator.&quot; <lb/>11. IHMCL issued an amended LOA on 19.12.2018 on the basis of <lb/>the revised cost on the L-1 rates for Zone-5 under the 2018 RFP. The <lb/>same was accepted by SOWiL on 03.01.2019, however it reserved its <lb/>right to raise claims in this regard, before the Arbitral Tribunal. <lb/>12. The arbitral proceedings commenced on 24.12.2019. Before the <lb/>Arbitral Tribunal, SOWiL filed its Statement of Claims raising the <lb/>following claims. <lb/>&quot;CLAIM NO.1: Declaration that the Claimant is entitled to <lb/>perform the Contract dated 28.10.2014 for a fixed period <lb/>of ten (10) rounds of traffic surveys, at the price bid <lb/>submitted by the Claimant and consciously accepted by <lb/>IHMCL vide letter of award dated 13.08.2014, and that the <lb/>action of IHMCL in issuance of the Impugned Tender <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 5 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>during the subsistence of the Contract is illegal, arbitrary <lb/>and invalid. <lb/>CLAIM NO.2: Direction for payment on account of the <lb/>difference between the rate at which the Claimant was <lb/>awarded the Contract and the L-1 rate in respect of Zone-<lb/>5 received by IHMCL pursuant to the Impugned Tender <lb/>along with interest @20.25% per annum from the due date <lb/>of payment under each of the invoices as may be raised by <lb/>the Claimant till the date of payment. <lb/>CLAIM NO.3: Loss amounting to Rs. 5,12,97,777/-<lb/>suffered by the Claimant on account of idling of the <lb/>manpower, equipment and resources of the Claimant under <lb/>the Contract due to breach on the part of IHMCL to provide <lb/>the Claimant with traffic survey locations timely and in a <lb/>stream-lined manner along with pendente lite and future <lb/>interest @20.25% per annum till the date of payment. <lb/>CLAIM NO.4:(i) Direct payment of a sum of Rs. <lb/>3,84,65,000/-to the Claimant towards the outstanding dues <lb/>under the invoices raised by the Claimant upon IHMCL; <lb/>and (ii) Direct the payment of a sum of Rs. 1,76,71,057/-<lb/>to the Claimant towards interest on delayed payments for <lb/>the period of delay, calculated as on 21.01.2019, along <lb/>with pendente lite and future interest @20.25% per annum <lb/>till the date of payment. <lb/>CLAIM NO.5: Loss amounting to Rs. 10,34,83,000/-<lb/>suffered by the Claimant on account of non-listing of <lb/>proposed shares of the Claimant on the SME Stock <lb/>Exchange, due to breach of the contract by IHMCL by the <lb/>illegal and arbitrary act of IHMCL in issuance of the <lb/>Impugned Tender along with pendente lite and future <lb/>interest @20.25% per annum till the date of payment. <lb/></body>

			<body>CLAIM NO.6: Direct payment of costs (as per actuals) <lb/>incurred by the Claimant in connection with the present <lb/>arbitration proceedings.&quot; <lb/>13. The Arbitral Tribunal considered the rival contentions of the <lb/>parties and accordingly, held that the actions of IHMCL did not amount <lb/>to a breach of the Contract. The Tribunal found that IHMCL&apos;s action of <lb/>issuance of the 2018 RFP was only a price discovery mechanism, which <lb/>was not barred under the terms of the Contract. It further held that a <lb/>proposal to invoke Clause 12.2 of the Contract by IHMCL does not <lb/>mean that the Contract has been terminated and therefore, rejected the <lb/>claims made by SOWiL, in this regard. <lb/>14. In respect of SOWiL&apos;s claim for the difference between the rate <lb/>at which SOWiL was awarded the Contract and the L-1 rate quoted in <lb/>the 2018 RFP for the balance works, the Arbitral Tribunal held that <lb/>IHMCL could not alter the unit price to SOWiL&apos;s detriment during the <lb/>subsistence of the Contract. It, accordingly, held that SOWiL was <lb/>entitled to the differential rate for the 7 th and 8 th rounds, as it had already <lb/>commenced survey for the said rounds. <lb/>15. The Arbitral Tribunal further found IHMCL liable to pay <lb/>â‚¹47,85,655/-towards the outstanding amount due under the invoices <lb/>raised by SOWiL; and, an amount of â‚¹1,81,72,387/-towards interest on <lb/>the delayed payments for the survey of rounds 1 to 6 conducted by <lb/>SOWiL And, accordingly, entered an award in favour of SOWil for the <lb/>aforesaid sums. The Arbitral Tribunal also held that SOWiL is entitled <lb/>to interest for delayed payments in respect of rounds 7 and 8. <lb/></body>

			<body>16. The Arbitral Tribunal awarded interest at the rate of 20.25% per <lb/>annum compounded monthly in respect of delayed payments for the <lb/>service rendered by SOWiL and, on the outstanding dues amounting to <lb/>â‚¹47,85,655/-. In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal also awarded interest at <lb/>the rate of 20.25% per annum on the differential amount due to be paid <lb/>by IHMCL to SOWiL for the 7 th and 8 th round from the due date till <lb/>payment. <lb/>17. The Arbitral Tribunal also awarded costs quantified at <lb/>â‚¹46,87,235/-in favour of SOWil and directed that the same be paid <lb/>within a period of thirty days from the date of the award, failing which, <lb/>SOWiL would be entitled to simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum <lb/>on the said amount from the date of the award till actual payment. <lb/>18. SOWiL&apos;s claim for loss on account of non-listing of proposed <lb/>public issues of shares on the SME Stock Exchange and loss suffered <lb/>due to idling of its manpower, equipment and resources, were rejected <lb/>by the Arbitral Tribunal. <lb/>Submissions <lb/>19. Ms Priya, learned counsel appearing for IHMCL, assailed the <lb/>impugned award to the limited extent that the Arbitral Tribunal has <lb/>awarded interest at the rate of 20.25% per annum compounded monthly <lb/>in respect of the delayed payments for the services rendered by it to <lb/>SOWiL from the due date till the date of payment. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 8 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>20. SOWiL had claimed an amount equivalent to the difference <lb/>between the rate at which the Contract was awarded to it and the rates <lb/>tendered by the lowest tenderer (L1) as discovered by IHMCL in respect <lb/>of Zone-5 pursuant to tenders received in response to 2018 RFP. <lb/>SOWiL claimed the said amount along with interest at the rate of <lb/>20.25% per annum (Claim No.2). In addition, SOWiL also sought <lb/>outstanding amounts in respect of the invoices raised by it along with <lb/>interest at the rate of 20.25% per annum (Claim No.4). It also claimed <lb/>interest at the same rate, that is, at the rate of 20.25% per annum <lb/>compounded monthly in respect of the loss suffered by it. <lb/>21. On the basis of the rival pleadings, the Arbitral Tribunal had <lb/>struck issues on 25.03.2019. Issue Nos. 7 and 9 are relevant and are set <lb/>out below: -<lb/>&quot;7. Whether the Claimant is entitled for payment of a <lb/>sum of Rs1,76,71,057/-towards interest on delayed <lb/>payments for the period of delay, calculated as on <lb/>21.01.2019? OPC <lb/>9. Whether the Claimant is entitled to pendente lite <lb/>and future interest 20.25% per annum compounded <lb/>monthly on the claimed amounts till date of <lb/>payment? OPC&quot; <lb/>22. SOWiL had founded its claim for interest on Section 16 of the <lb/>MSMED Act. IHMCL did not contest that SOWiL was not entitled to <lb/>interest; it however, disputed SOWiL&apos;s entitlement to interest in terms <lb/>of Section 16 of the MSMED Act. IHMCL contended that SOWiL was <lb/>entitled to reasonable interest. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 376/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 9 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>23. The Arbitral Tribunal referred to Sections 15, 16 and 17 of the <lb/>MSMED Act and found that SOWiL, being a small enterprise, was <lb/>covered under the provisions of the said enactment and was entitled to <lb/>interest as contemplated under Section 16 of the MSMED Act. The <lb/>Arbitral Tribunal also referred to Section 24 of the MSMED Act, which <lb/>contains a non-obstante provision that expressly provides that the <lb/>provisions under Sections 15 to 23 of the MSMED Act shall have effect <lb/>notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other <lb/>law for the time being in force. <lb/>24. Ms Priya submitted that the provisions of Section 16 of the <lb/>MSMED Act were not applicable as SOWiL had not taken recourse to <lb/>arbitration under Section 18 of the MSMED Act but had relied on the <lb/>contractual provisions for invocation of the arbitration agreement. She <lb/>contended that an arbitral tribunal, which has been constituted under <lb/>Section 18 of the MSMED Act, would have the jurisdiction to <lb/>adjudicate the disputes between the parties regarding the amounts <lb/>payable under Section 17 of the MSMED Act but an arbitral tribunal <lb/>constituted otherwise than pursuant to reference under Section 18 of the <lb/>MSMED Act, would have no jurisdiction to do so. She referred to the <lb/>decision of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of AVR <lb/>Enterprises v. Union of India: 2020 SCC OnLine Del 624 and <lb/>submitted that Section 18 of the MSMED Act would apply only to <lb/>proceedings initiated under Section 18 of the MSMED Act and would <lb/>not apply to an award published by an arbitrator appointed by the parties <lb/>otherwise and in accordance with Section 18 of the MSMED Act. Ms <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 376/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 10 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>Priya submitted that using the same analogy, interest under Section 16 <lb/>of the MSMED Act was not payable if arbitration was not conducted <lb/>under Section 18 of the MSMED Act. She also relied on the decision of <lb/>the Madras High Court in M/s SAVIO Industrial and Structural <lb/>Corporation v. Southern Railway and Ors.: 2016 SCC OnLine Mad <lb/>30027, in support of her contention. <lb/>25. Ms Manmeet Arora, learned counsel appearing for SOWiL, <lb/>countered the aforesaid submissions. She submitted that the MSMED <lb/>Act was enacted, inter alia, with the stated objective to make further <lb/>improvements in the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and <lb/>Ancillary Undertakings Act, 1993, which were incorporated in the <lb/>MSMED Act. She submitted that therefore, the decision of the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal to award interest in terms of Section 16 of the MSMED Act <lb/>could not be faulted. She also referred to the decisions of the Supreme <lb/>Court in Snehadeep Structures Pvt. Ltd. v. Maharashtra Small Scale <lb/>Industries Development Corporation Ltd.: (2010) 3 SCC 34 and Shilpi <lb/>Industries v. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation and Anr.: <lb/>2021 SCCOnLine SC 439, in support of her contention that the <lb/>provisions of MSMED Act would override the provisions of Section <lb/>31(1)(a) of the A&amp;C Act. <lb/>26. The only question to be addressed is whether the impugned award <lb/>is vitiated by patent illegality or is in conflict with the public policy of <lb/>India. And, warrants interference in these proceedings. <lb/>27. It is important to note at the outset that there is no dispute that <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 376/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 11 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>SOWiL is entitled to interest on delayed payments as well as on <lb/>differential amounts on account of difference in the rates as agreed in <lb/>terms of the Contract between the parties and the lowest rates as <lb/>discovered in the tenders invited subsequently. There is also no dispute <lb/>that SOWiL is a small enterprise and falls within the definition of a <lb/>Supplier within the meaning of Section 2(n) of the MSMED Act. The <lb/>only contention advanced on behalf of IHMCL before this Court is that <lb/>Section 16 of the MSMED Act is not applicable for the reason that the <lb/>learned Arbitrator was appointed under Section 11 of the A&amp;C Act and, <lb/>not pursuant to reference by the Micro and Small Enterprise Facilitation <lb/>Council (the Council). <lb/>28. Sections 15, 16 and 17 of the MSMED Act are relevant and are <lb/>set out below: -<lb/>&quot;15. Liability of buyer to make payment. -Where <lb/>any supplier supplies any goods or renders any services <lb/>to any buyer, the buyer shall make payment therefor on <lb/>or before the date agreed upon between him and the <lb/>supplier in writing or, where there is no agreement in this <lb/>behalf, before the appointed day: <lb/>Provided that in no case the period agreed upon between <lb/>the supplier and the buyer in writing shall exceed forty-<lb/>five days from the day of acceptance or the day of deemed <lb/>acceptance. <lb/>16. Date from which and rate at which interest is <lb/>payable. -Where any buyer fails to make payment of the <lb/>amount to the supplier, as required under section 15, the <lb/>buyer shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any <lb/>agreement between the buyer and the supplier or in any <lb/>law for the time being in force, be liable to pay compound <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 376/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 12 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>interest with monthly rests to the supplier on that amount <lb/>from the appointed day or, as the case may be, from the <lb/>date immediately following the date agreed upon, at three <lb/>times of the bank rate notified by the Reserve Bank. <lb/>17. Recovery of amount due. -For any goods <lb/>supplied or services rendered by the supplier, the buyer <lb/>shall be liable to pay the amount with interest thereon as <lb/>provided under section 16.&quot; <lb/>29. A plain reading of Section 15 of the MSMED Act makes it <lb/>mandatory for the buyer to make payment for the goods supplied to it <lb/>by a Supplier within the period as agreed by the parties or, where there <lb/>is no agreement in this regard, before the appointed date. The expression <lb/>&apos;appointed date&apos; is defined under Section 2(b) of the MSMED Act to <lb/>means the day following immediately after the expiry of the period of <lb/>fifteen days from the day of acceptance of the goods. Further, the <lb/>proviso to Section 15 of the MSMED Act makes it clear that under no <lb/>circumstances, the period agreed between the supplier and buyer would <lb/>exceed forty-five days from the day of acceptance or day of deemed <lb/>acceptance of the goods. Section 16 of the MSMED Act provides for <lb/>payment of interest on the amounts due to a supplier where the buyer <lb/>has failed to pay the amounts as required under Section 15 of the <lb/>MSMED Act. Undisputedly, the buyer&apos;s obligation to discharge its <lb/>liability under Section 15 of the MSMED Act and to pay interest under <lb/>Section 16 of the MSMED Act confers the right on &apos;the Supplier&apos; to <lb/>demand and recover the said amount. Section 17 of the MSMED Act <lb/>also provides that the buyer would be liable to pay the amount and the <lb/>interest as provided under Section 16 of the MSMED Act. Section 17 <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 376/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 13 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>of the MSMED Act also makes it amply clear that the buyers would be <lb/>liable to pay the amount due, along with interest, as provided under <lb/>Section 16 of the MSMED Act to &apos;the Supplier&apos;. It is material to note <lb/>that Sections 15 and 16 of the MSMED Act imposes the liability on the <lb/>buyer to pay the due amount to the supplier within the specified period <lb/>and to pay interest if it fails to do so, independent of the provisions of <lb/>Section 17 of the MSMED Act. <lb/>30. Section 18 of the MSMED Act provides for reference to the <lb/>Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council. It would be relevant <lb/>to refer to Sections 18 and 19 of the MSMED Act, which are set out <lb/>below: <lb/>&quot;18. Reference to Micro and Small Enterprises <lb/>Facilitation Council. -(1) Notwithstanding anything <lb/>contained in any other law for the time being in force, any <lb/>party to a dispute may, with regard to any amount due <lb/>under section 17, make a reference to the Micro and <lb/>Small Enterprises Facilitation Council. <lb/>(2) On receipt of a reference under sub-section (1), the <lb/>Council shall either itself conduct conciliation in the <lb/>matter or seek the assistance of any institution or centre <lb/>providing alternate dispute resolution services by making <lb/>a reference to such an institution or centre, for conducting <lb/>conciliation and the provisions of sections 65 to 81 of the <lb/>Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall <lb/>apply to such a dispute as if the conciliation was initiated <lb/>under Part III of that Act. <lb/>(3) Where the conciliation initiated under sub-<lb/>section (2) is not successful and stands terminated <lb/>without any settlement between the parties, the Council <lb/>shall either itself take up the dispute for arbitration or <lb/></body>

			<body>refer it to any institution or centre providing alternate <lb/>dispute resolution services for such arbitration and the <lb/>provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 <lb/>(26 of 1996) shall then apply to the dispute as if the <lb/>arbitration was in pursuance of an arbitration agreement <lb/>referred to in sub-section(1) of section 7 of that Act. <lb/>(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other <lb/>law for the time being in force, the Micro and Small <lb/>Enterprises Facilitation Council or the centre providing <lb/>alternate dispute resolution services shall have <lb/>jurisdiction to act as an Arbitrator or Conciliator under <lb/>this section in a dispute between the supplier located <lb/>within its jurisdiction and a buyer located anywhere in <lb/>India. <lb/>(5) Every reference made under this section shall be <lb/>decided within a period of ninety days from the date of <lb/>making such a reference. <lb/>19. Application for setting aside decree, award or <lb/>order.-No application for setting aside any decree, award <lb/>or other order made either by the Council itself or by any <lb/>institution or centre providing alternate dispute resolution <lb/>services to which a reference is made by the Council, <lb/>shall be entertained by any court unless the appellant (not <lb/>being a supplier) has deposited with it seventy-five per <lb/>cent of the amount in terms of the decree, award or, as the <lb/>case may be, the other order in the manner directed by <lb/>such court: <lb/>Provided that pending disposal of the application <lb/>to set aside the decree, award or order, the court shall <lb/>order that such percentage of the amount deposited shall <lb/>be paid to the supplier, as it considers reasonable under <lb/>the circumstances of the case, subject to such conditions <lb/>as it deems necessary to impose.&quot; <lb/>31. It is material to note that Section 18(1) of the MSMED Act opens <lb/></body>

			<body>with a non obstante clause. It expressly provides that notwithstanding <lb/>anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, any <lb/>party to a dispute may, with regard to any amount due under Section 17 <lb/>of the MSMED Act, make a reference to the Micro and Small <lb/>Enterprises Facilitation Council. It is clear that either of the parties, to <lb/>any dispute regarding the amounts in respect of goods and services and, <lb/>interest due under Section 16 of the MSMED Act (which is the amount <lb/>referred to as the amount due under Section 17 of the MSMED Act) is <lb/>entitled to make a reference to the Micro and Small Enterprises <lb/>Facilitation Council for resolution of the dispute. Sub-Section (2) to <lb/>Section 18 of the MSMED Act provides for resolution of disputes by <lb/>Conciliation either by the Council or, by any institution or centre for <lb/>conducting Conciliation under the A&amp;C Act. <lb/>32. Sub-Section (3) to Section 18 of the MSMED Act provides for <lb/>adjudication of disputes by arbitration either by the Micro and Small <lb/>Enterprises Facilitation Council or, by any institution or centre <lb/>providing alternate dispute resolution services for arbitration. It further <lb/>clarifies that the provisions of the A&amp;C Act would apply to disputes as <lb/>if the arbitration in pursuance of an arbitration agreement referred to in <lb/>Sub-Section (1) of Section 7 of the A&amp;C Act. <lb/>33. Section 19 of the MSMED Act provides that no application to set <lb/>aside any decree, award or other order made by the Council or the <lb/>institution or center providing alternate dispute resolution services shall <lb/>be entertained unless 75% of the said amount is deposited in terms of <lb/>the decree, award or the order as directed by the Court. <lb/></body>

			<body>34. It is apparent from the above that the provisions of Sections 15 <lb/>and 16 of the MSMED Act confer substantive rights and impose <lb/>obligations, which are not contingent upon recourse to any dispute <lb/>resolution mechanism. Section 18 of the MSMED Act provides for a <lb/>dispute resolution mechanism in respect of any amount due under <lb/>Section 17 of the MSMED Act. It is obvious that it may not be necessary <lb/>for a supplier to seek recourse to any proceedings for recovery of the <lb/>amounts that may be otherwise due to it, if the buyer complies with its <lb/>obligation under Sections 15 and 16 of the MSMED Act. <lb/>35. The import of the contentions advanced on behalf of IHMCL is <lb/>that the obligations of the buyer under Sections 15 and 16 of the <lb/>MSMED Act are contingent upon the supplier resorting to Conciliation <lb/>or the adjudicatory process under Section 18 of the MSMED Act. The <lb/>plain language of Sections 15, 16 and 17 of the MSMED Act, does not <lb/>support this proposition. <lb/>36. The reliance placed by IHMCL on the decision of this Court in <lb/>AVR Enterprises v. Union of India (supra), is misplaced. In the said <lb/>case, the Court was concerned with the question whether it could <lb/>entertain a petition under Section 34 of the A&amp;C Act without the <lb/>petitioner depositing 75% of the awarded amount in terms of Section <lb/>19 of the MSMED Act. The Court held that the requirement of Section <lb/>19 of the MSMED Act would be applicable only in cases where <lb/>reference was made under Section 18 of the MSMED Act and would <lb/>not apply to an award rendered by an arbitral tribunal appointed <lb/>otherwise. It is relevant to note that this Court relied on the plain <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 17 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>language of Section 19 of the MSMED Act, which specified that it <lb/>would apply to any decree, award or order made by the Council or by <lb/>any institution or center providing alternate dispute resolution services <lb/>to which reference was made by the Council. This condition would not <lb/>be met in cases where an arbitrator is appointed by the parties or by a <lb/>court under Section 11 of the A&amp;C Act. The plain language of Section <lb/>19 of the MSMED Act does not require a pre-deposit of seventy-five <lb/>percent of the awarded amount in respect of an arbitral award rendered <lb/>by an Arbitral Tribunal which has not been appointed pursuant to a <lb/>reference under Section 18 of the MSMED Act. The judgment in AVR <lb/>Enterprises v. Union of India (supra) is not an authority for the <lb/>proposition that the beneficial provisions of the MSMED Act would be <lb/>inapplicable where a party does not seek to enforce its rights under <lb/>Section 18 of the MSMED Act. <lb/>37. The decision in the case of M/s SAVIO Industrial and Structural <lb/>Corporation v. Southern Railway and Ors. (supra) does not carry the <lb/>case of the petitioner much further. In that case, the arbitral tribunal <lb/>had concluded that the MSMED Act was not applicable. This was for <lb/>the reason that the amount claimed by the petitioner was not on account <lb/>of the amount due for sale of any material or for the services rendered. <lb/>The Division Bench of the Madras High Court concurred with the view <lb/>of the arbitral tribunal and held that the provisions of Sections 15 and <lb/>16 of the MSMED Act were not applicable as these provisions created <lb/>an obligation to pay compound interest only in respect of the amounts <lb/>due for the goods supplied or service rendered. The Court did not <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 18 of 23 <lb/></page>

			<body>accept that the provisions of Section 19 of the MSMED Act were <lb/>applicable since in that case the arbitral award was not rendered by an <lb/>arbitral tribunal appointed pursuant to a reference under Section 18(1) <lb/>of the MSMED Act. <lb/>38. As noted above, the plain language of Section 19 of the MSMED <lb/>Act limits its application only to the arbitral award or orders passed by <lb/>the Facilitation Council pursuant to a reference under Section 18(1) of <lb/>the MSMED Act or by an arbitral tribunal appointed pursuant to such <lb/>reference. Sections 15 and 16 of the MSMED Act do not contain any <lb/>such restrictive provisions, which limits their applicability. There is <lb/>nothing stated in Section 15 or 16 of the MSMED Act which restricts <lb/>the amount recoverable under the said provisions contingent to a <lb/>reference under Section 18(1) of the MSMED Act. <lb/>39. It is necessary to note that Section 18(3) of the MSMED Act also <lb/>expressly provides that where the disputes are referred to arbitration <lb/>either by the Council or to any institution or centre providing alternate <lb/>dispute resolution services, the provisions of A&amp;C Act would apply to <lb/>such disputes as if the arbitration was in pursuance to an arbitration <lb/>agreement referred to in Section 7(1) of the A&amp;C Act. Section 18(3) of <lb/>the MSMED Act creates a legal fiction, whereby the provisions of the <lb/>A&amp;C Act are made applicable to arbitration pursuant to the reference <lb/>under Section 18(3) of the MSMED Act. During the course of <lb/>submissions, it was contended on behalf of the respondent that an award <lb/>for interest under Section 16 of the MSMED Act could be made in <lb/>proceedings under Section 18 of the MSMED Act but not by an arbitral <lb/></body>

			<body>tribunal appointed in terms of the A&amp;C Act. In such cases, the arbitral <lb/>tribunal was required to award reasonable interest under Section <lb/>31(7)(a) of the A&amp;C Act. This Court finds it difficult to accept this <lb/>contention as it overlooks the express provisions of Section 18(3) of the <lb/>MSMED Act. The provisions of the A&amp;C Act are specifically <lb/>applicable as they would be in case of arbitration pursuant to an <lb/>arbitration agreement under Section 7(1) of the A&amp;C Act. However, in <lb/>case of repugnancy between the provisions of the A&amp;C Act and the <lb/>MSMED Act, the provisions of the MSMED would prevail. <lb/>40. It is also relevant to refer to the decision in the case of Snehdeep <lb/>Structures Pvt. Ltd. v. Maharashtra Small Scale Industries <lb/>Development Corporation Ltd. (supra). The said case was rendered in <lb/>the context of Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and <lb/>Ancillary Undertakings Act, 1993. In that case, the Court held that <lb/>Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary <lb/>Undertakings Act, 1993 (referred to as the &apos;Interest Act&apos; in short by the <lb/>court) was a special legislation viz-a-viz to any other legislation <lb/>including the A&amp;C Act and the contention that the payment of interest <lb/>would be governed by Section 31(7)(a) of the A&amp;C Act, was rejected <lb/>as erroneous. The relevant extract of the said decision is set out below: <lb/>&quot;37. According to the learned counsel for the <lb/>respondent Corporation, the Arbitration Act treats <lb/>&quot;appeals&quot; and &quot;applications&quot; separately under two <lb/>distinct chapters: Chapter VII and Chapter IX <lb/>respectively. It was also strenuously contended by the <lb/>learned counsel for the respondent that the Arbitration <lb/>Act contains specific provisions for awarding interest and <lb/></body>

			<body>that Act being a special enactment will prevail over the <lb/>Interest Act. He relied on Jay Engg. Works Ltd. v. <lb/>Industry Facilitation Council to show that against the <lb/>provisions of the Interest Act, the provisions of <lb/>Arbitration Act will prevail, as the latter is a complete <lb/>code in itself. The Interest Act will apply only when the <lb/>party prefers a suit to arbitration. <lb/>38. The Preamble of the Interest Act sows that the very <lb/>objective of the Act was &quot;to provide for and regulate the <lb/>payment of interest on delayed payments to small-scale <lb/>and ancillary industrial undertakings and for matters <lb/>connected therewith or incidental thereto.&quot; Thus, as far <lb/>as interest on delayed payment to small-scale industries <lb/>as well as connected matters are concerned, the Act is a <lb/>special legislation with respect to any other legislation, <lb/>including the Arbitration Act. The contention of the <lb/>respondent that the matter of interest payment will be <lb/>governed by Section 31(7) of the Arbitration Act, hence, <lb/>is erroneous. Section 4 of the Interest Act endorses the <lb/>same which sets out the liability of the buyer to pay <lb/>interest to the supplier &quot;notwithstanding anything <lb/>contained in any agreement between the buyer and the <lb/>supplier or in any law for the time being in force&quot;. Thus, <lb/>the Interest Act is a special legislation as far as the <lb/>liability to pay interest, or to make a deposit thereof, <lb/>while challenging an award / decree / order granting <lb/>interest is concerned.&quot; <lb/>41. As pointed out by Ms Arora, one of the Statements and Objects <lb/>of enacting the MSMED Act was to &quot;make further improvements in the <lb/>Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial <lb/>Undertakings Act, 1993 and making that enactment a part of the <lb/>proposed legislation and to repeal that enactment.&quot; <lb/>42.

			<body>and Anr. (supra), the Supreme Court had observed as under:-<lb/>&quot;At this stage, it is relevant to notice the judgment <lb/>of this Court in the case of Edukanti Kistamma <lb/>(Dead) through LRs. v. S. Venkatareddy (Dead) <lb/>through LRs. &amp; Ors. where this Court has held that <lb/>a special Statute would be preferred over general <lb/>one where it is beneficial one. It was explained that <lb/>the purport and object of the Act must be given its <lb/>full effect by applying the principles of purposive <lb/>construction. Thus, it is clear that out of the two <lb/>legislations, the provisions of MSMED Act will <lb/>prevail, especially when it has overriding provision <lb/>under Section 24 thereof. Thus, we hold that <lb/>MSMED Act, being a special Statute, will have an <lb/>overriding <lb/>effect <lb/>vis-Ã -vis <lb/>Arbitration <lb/>and Conciliation Act, 1996, which is a general <lb/>Act.&quot; <lb/>[Underlined for emphasis] <lb/>43. In view of the above, it is clear that the MSMED Act is a special <lb/>legislation with regard to payment of interest and the provisions of <lb/>MSMED Act would override the provisions of the A&amp;C Act to the <lb/>extent of any repugnancy. This view further draws support from the non <lb/>obstante provisions of Section 24 of the MSMED Act, which reads as <lb/>under: -<lb/>&quot;24. Overriding effect. -The provisions of sections 15 <lb/>to 23 shall have effect notwithstanding anything <lb/>inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the <lb/>time being in force.&quot; <lb/>44. Ms Priya had also referred to the decision of the Supreme Court <lb/>in Vedanta Ltd. v. Shenzen Shandong Nuclear Power Construction <lb/></body>

			<body>Co. Ltd.: (2019 11 SCC 465 and, on the strength of the said decision, <lb/>contended that the award of interest was required to be awarded in <lb/>accordance with Section 31(7) of the A&amp;C Act and was thus, required <lb/>to be reduced. The said decision would be of little assistance to IHMCL <lb/>in the facts of this case. In that case, the Court had found that the award <lb/>of interest was arbitrary and not in conformity with the laws in force. <lb/>The Court also found that the arbitral tribunal had awarded uniform <lb/>interest for the amounts payable in Indian currency as well as those <lb/>payable in Euros, although both the currencies operated in materially <lb/>different environments. As noticed above in this case, the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal has found that SOWiL is liable to pay interest under Section <lb/>16 of the MSMED Act and, thus, the impugned award does conform to <lb/>lex fori. <lb/>45. Before concluding, it would also relevant to reiterate that the <lb/>scope of interference with an arbitral award is restricted. It is <lb/>permissible only on the grounds as set out under Section 34 of the A&amp;C <lb/>Act. The view of an arbitral tribunal is final and binding unless it is <lb/>found that the impugned award is vitiated by patent illegality or falls <lb/>foul of the public policy of India. Even in those cases, where it is found <lb/>that the arbitral tribunal has erred in law, interference with the arbitral <lb/>award would not be permissible unless it is found that the patent <lb/>illegality goes to the root of the matter and which vitiates the award <lb/>[See: Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. v. Delhi Metro Rail <lb/>Corporation Ltd.: 2021 SCC OnLine SC 695]. Clearly, in this case, the <lb/>impugned award cannot be stated to be vitiated by patent illegality or in <lb/></body>
