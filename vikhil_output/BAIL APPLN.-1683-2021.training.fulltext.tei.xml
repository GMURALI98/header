Nidhu Devi went back to the native village of<lb/> the deceased and brought him with her on the pretext of employment and<lb/> then the incident took place on the fateful day. Looking at the gravity of the<lb/> offence, the nature of injuries, the manner in which the incident took place<lb/> and the fact that the petitioners do not reside in Delhi and the chances of<lb/> their absconding are high, this Court is not inclined to grant bail to the<lb/> petitioners at this juncture.<lb/> 12. Accordingly, the bail applications are dismissed along with the<lb/> pending application(s), if any.<lb/> 13. The Trial Court is directed to expedite the trial and conclude the same<lb/> within a period of eight months.<lb/> 14. It is made clear that the observations made in this order are not on the<lb/> merits of the case.<lb/> SUBRAMONIUM PRASAD, J<lb/> OCTOBER 21, 2021<lb/> Rahul</item>
