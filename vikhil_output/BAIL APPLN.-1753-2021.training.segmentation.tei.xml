			<body>BAIL APPLN. 1753/2021 <lb/>Page 2 of 6 <lb/>approximately. It is alleged that accused persons induced the victims to <lb/>invest Rs. 62,000/-for a bike and were assured that they will receive Rs. <lb/>9,500/-monthly including principal and rental income on a bike for one <lb/>year. Due to lucrative offers floated by the accused persons, number of <lb/>victims invested their hard-earned money in huge sums into this scheme. <lb/>In January 2019, accused company launched Electric-Bike scheme and <lb/>offered to investors that they can deposit Rs.1,24,000/-for a bike and <lb/>assured that they will receive Rs. 17,000/-per month till one year. <lb/>Initially, accused company repaid the assured amount but after winning <lb/>confidence of the investors, they absconded. On the basis of allegations <lb/>leveled and enquiry conducted, the instant FIR was lodged. <lb/>3. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned APP <lb/>for the state and perused the status report filed by the state. <lb/>4. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner has <lb/>been falsely implicated in this case and the allegations made in the FIR <lb/>have no relation with the petitioner. It is further submitted that the <lb/>petitioner is running in judicial custody since 13.08.2019 and was <lb/>formally arrested in this case on 24.11.2021. It is further submitted that it <lb/>is wrong to suggest that the petitioner has received huge sum out of the <lb/>investments made by the complainants as the petitioner did not receive <lb/>any benefit or remuneration from the company apart from the salary to <lb/>which he is entitled against his job and services to the said company. It is <lb/>further submitted that at the time of employment the company fixed the <lb/>salary of petitioner to be Rs 80,000/-per month and the salary of the <lb/>petitioner was transferred in his bank account. It is further submitted that <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 1753/2021 <lb/>Page 3 of 6 <lb/>investigating officer as well as prosecution has failed to establish the role <lb/>of the petitioner and further failed to prove their story as petitioner being <lb/>the main entrenched in the present FIR. Ld. counsel for the petitioner <lb/>submitted that in the entire tenure of petitioner&quot;s employment with Garvit <lb/>Innovative Promotors Limited, the petitioner had no connection with the <lb/>ponzi &quot;Bike Bot Scheme&quot; nor was he aware with the day-to-day affairs <lb/>of the &quot;Bike Bot&quot;. It is further submitted that from perusal of the entire <lb/>material on record, it is evident that the whole inflow of money has been <lb/>directly credited to the bank account of the company by the investors and <lb/>the remittance of any returns have directly been made from the bank <lb/>account itself and as such not a single penny has been misappropriated by <lb/>the petitioner. It is further submitted that chargesheet has been filed in <lb/>this case and no recovery is to be effected from the petitioner. It is further <lb/>submitted that the petitioner is innocent and no useful purpose would be <lb/>served by keeping him in custody. It is further submitted that the co-<lb/>accused persons are on bail and petitioner seeks parity. Learned counsel <lb/>for petitioner has relied upon Dataram Singh v. State of U.P. &amp;anr, <lb/>(2018) 3 SCC 22. <lb/>5. On the other hand, learned APP vehemently opposed the bail application <lb/>and submitted that the allegations are serious in nature and the Company <lb/>induced investments from gullible and innocent people by offering <lb/>lucrative returns and floating theponzi &quot;Bike Bot Scheme&quot;. It is further <lb/>submitted that the total cheated amount in the case is of more than <lb/>Rupees forty-two thousand crores approximately. Ld. APP for the state <lb/>submitted that the investigation revealed that the petitioner was the Chief <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 1753/2021 <lb/>Page 4 of 6 <lb/>Executive officer (C.E.O.) and promoter in the accused company M/s <lb/>Garvit Innovative Promoters Limited. It is further submitted that he is <lb/>named in the FIR registered on the complaint of various investors and an <lb/>amount of Rs. 5,00,000/-approximately has been found to be credited in <lb/>his bank account from the account of accused company M/s Garvit <lb/>Innovative Promoters Limited. It is further submitted that in their <lb/>examinations, number of victims stated that the petitioner Tarun Kumar <lb/>was promoting the alleged fraudulent scheme and was inducing them to <lb/>invest in the ponzi Bike Bot scheme. It is further submitted that the <lb/>petitioner is running in judicial custody in three cases registered by U.P <lb/>Police in the same Bike Bot scam. Lastly, it is submitted that he may <lb/>abscond if he is released on bail and may not be available for trial which <lb/>may vitiate the interests of justice. <lb/>6. The petitioner is in judicial custody since 13.08.2019 and was formally <lb/>arrested in this case on 24.11.2021. The petitioner was the Chief <lb/>Executive officer (C.E.O.) and promoter in the accused company M/s <lb/>Garvit Innovative Promoters Limited and from the material on record, it <lb/>is clear that no active role has been assigned to the petitioner in <lb/>connection to the ponzi &quot;Bike Bot Scheme&quot; and even during petitioner&quot;s <lb/>employment with the said company, the petitioner did not play an active <lb/>role in the day-to-day affairs of the company. <lb/>7. The investigation in this matter has been completed and the chargesheet <lb/>has been filed. Moreover, no recovery is to be effected from the <lb/>petitioner and he is no longer required for investigation purposes. The <lb/>trial would take a long time to conclude and no fruitful purpose would be <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 1753/2021 <lb/>Page 5 of 6 <lb/>served by keeping him detained in prison. The petitioner has been <lb/>granted bail by Allahabad High Court in one of the cases having similar <lb/>allegations and the co-accused persons have also been granted bail. <lb/>Therefore, in view of the submissions mentioned hereinabove and <lb/>considering the period of incarceration and ground of parity, the bail <lb/>application stands allowed and the petitioner is admitted to bail on his <lb/>furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/-with one surety in <lb/>the like amount to the satisfaction of concerned trial court subject to the <lb/>following conditions: <lb/>(i) <lb/>The petitioner shall provide his mobile phone number to the <lb/>Investigating Officer (IO) concerned -at the time of release, <lb/>which shall be kept in working condition at all times. The <lb/>petitioner shall not switch-off, or change the same without <lb/>prior intimation to the IO concerned, during the period of <lb/>bail; <lb/>(ii) <lb/>The petitioner shall provide his residential address to the <lb/>Investigating Officer (IO) concerned -at the time of release. <lb/>The petitioner shall not change the same without prior <lb/>intimation to the IO concerned, during the period of bail; <lb/>(iii) <lb/>The petitioner shall mark his attendance to the SHO/IO <lb/>concerned and keep him informed of his whereabouts every <lb/>Friday between 11:00 A.M. to 11:30 A.M. and between 5:00 <lb/>P.M. to 6:00 P.M. through video call and if a video call is not <lb/>possible, he may send SMS apropos his whereabouts, as well <lb/>as &quot;drop-a-pin&quot; on location app to indicate his location. The <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 1753/2021 <lb/>Page 6 of 6 <lb/>IO&quot;s telephone number shall be provided to the learned <lb/>counsel for the petitioner; <lb/>(iv) <lb/>The petitioner shall not leave the NCT of Delhi without the <lb/>prior permission of the concerned trial court.; <lb/>(v) <lb/>The petitioner shall not indulge in any criminal activity <lb/>during the bail period; and <lb/>(vi) <lb/>The petitioner shall not indulge in any illegal activities and <lb/>he should not leave India without prior permission of the <lb/>court below. <lb/>8.
