			<body>The petitioners are husband and wife. Petitioner no. 1 is the brother of <lb/>the complainant of this case. They are seeking anticipatory bail as they <lb/>apprehend arrest by the police in connection with the criminal case got <lb/>registered against them by the complainant vide FIR No. 06/2010 under Sections <lb/>327/380/506/34 IPC. <lb/>2. <lb/>The petitioner no. 1 and his sister, the complainant, have inherited one <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 141/2010 <lb/>Page 2 of 5 <lb/>commercial property in Malviya Nagar from their deceased father. The <lb/>complainant is a widow. Her deceased husband owned one residential flat in <lb/>Sheikh Sarai which is in occupation of the two petitioners herein. It appears that <lb/>the petitioner no. 1 and the complainant decided to sell the property in Malviya <lb/>Nagar and accordingly they sold the same for Rs. 70 lacs. The complainant <lb/>alleged in her complaint to the police that on 4 th January, 2010 when the sale <lb/>deal was struck the purchasers brought the cash payment of Rs. 50 lacs to her <lb/>house in two bags containing Rs. 25 lacs each. The two petitioners were also <lb/>present at that time. Balance payment of sale consideration was allegedly made <lb/>by the purchasers by way of cheques. It was further alleged that after the <lb/>payment of sale consideration had been made by the purchasers, the <lb/>complainant, the petitioners and the purchasers then went for registration of the <lb/>sale deed. After getting the sale deed registered she came back to her house <lb/>along with her brother and bhabhi. At that time, her brother and her bhabhi beat <lb/>her up and went away after taking away the entire cash payment of Rs. 50 lacs <lb/>which had been kept by her in her house before leaving to get the sale deed <lb/>registered and while going from her house the petitioners also took away another <lb/>sum of Rs. 5 lacs which was also lying in the house besides some jewellery <lb/>items. From the allegations made in the FIR it appears that the complainant <lb/>wanted her residential flat back from her brother who was occupying the same <lb/>and it also appears that some MoU was executed between the brother and the <lb/>sister. Since the petitioner no. 1 apprehended that he might have to vacate the <lb/>flat in Sheikh Sarai he along with his wife while leaving the complainant&apos;s <lb/>house on 4 th January, 2010 tore that MOU also. This is the case of the <lb/>investigating agency. <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 141/2010 <lb/>Page 3 of 5 <lb/>3. <lb/>During the pendency of this anticipatory bail application the police has <lb/>recovered the amount of Rs. 25 lacs. <lb/>4. <lb/>It has been claimed by the petitioners in the bail application as well as <lb/>during the course of hearing of application through their learned senior counsel <lb/>Sh. K.K. Sud, that the complainant has a history of lunacy and there have been <lb/>many complaints not only from her own family members but from her <lb/>neighbours also that she was indulging in disorderly behaviour and because of <lb/>that she was once taken into custody also by the police pursuant to the orders of <lb/>the Area Magistrate. It has further been claimed that she had also been declared <lb/>lunatic by the Doctors of Mental Hospital in Shahdara in the year 2005. It was <lb/>contended by the learned senior counsel for the petitioners that the flat in Sheikh <lb/>Sarai was in fact purchased from the parental money of the petitioner no. 1 and <lb/>the complainant though it stood in the name of the husband of the complainant. <lb/>The complainant&apos;s husband had taken a loan against that property but had failed <lb/>to re-pay the loan to the concerned bank which resulted into initiation of legal <lb/>proceedings for recovery of the loan amount by the bank and passing of an ex-<lb/>parte decree. The complainant being a lunatic, the petitioner no. 1 had been <lb/>trying to block the sale of that property in auction. Learned senior counsel also <lb/>contended that the complainant wanted petitioner no. 1 to pay his share also in <lb/>property in Malviya Nagar to her and not only that the complainant did not want <lb/>to pay anything to her brother for the time and money spent by him in protecting <lb/>the family property in Sheikh Sarai from being sold and with that purpose only <lb/>she had lodged false FIR against the petitioners on imaginary and baseless <lb/>allegations. Under these circumstances and also keeping in view the fact that the <lb/>investigating agency has already recovered Rs. 25 lacs from the petitioner no. 1 <lb/>and which amount has now been got converted into a FDR pursuant to the <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 141/2010 <lb/>Page 4 of 5 <lb/>orders of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Mr. Sud contended, the <lb/>petitioners are entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail. It was also contended by <lb/>Mr. Sud that in one of the status reports filed by the police in the present <lb/>proceedings it had been stated that the complainant&apos;s version that the purchasers <lb/>of the property in Malviya Nagar had come to her house on 4 th January, 2010 <lb/>along with cash amount of Rs. 50 lacs had been found to be incorrect since the <lb/>purchasers had claimed that they had made the payment of Rs. 25 lacs to <lb/>petitioner no. 1 independently before their visit to the house of the complainant. <lb/>5. <lb/>The bail application was opposed on behalf of the State by the learned <lb/>Additional Public Prosecutor Mr. Pawan Behl primarily on the ground that <lb/>custodial interrogation of both the petitioners would be required for effecting <lb/>recoveries of the balance amount of Rs. 5 lacs of the complainant which also <lb/>they had taken away from the house of the complainant on 4 th January, 2010 as <lb/>also the jewellery articles. <lb/>6. <lb/>Considering all the facts and circumstances and particularly the fact that <lb/>it is a case of dispute between brother and sister in respect of ownership of the <lb/>flat in Sheikh Sarai which the petitioners claim to be their family property while <lb/>the complainant claims that it belongs to her after the death of her husband, <lb/>which dispute of title can be dealt with in civil proceedings, as also the fact that <lb/>the police has already recovered Rs. 25 lacs which the complainant claims to be <lb/>her share of money illegally taken away from her house by the petitioners, this <lb/>application is allowed and the interim relief already granted to them now stands <lb/>confirmed on the same terms and conditions. This application stands disposed of <lb/>accordingly. Considering the fact that the complainant is a widow and has two <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 141/2010 <lb/>Page 5 of 5 <lb/>young children to look after, the amount of Rs. 25 lacs lying in bank pursuant to <lb/>the orders of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate can be released to her subject <lb/>to her furnishing an adequate security to the satisfaction of the Metropolitan <lb/>Magistrate. <lb/>P.K. BHASIN,J <lb/>MAY 10, 2010 <lb/>pg </body>
