			<body>project of &quot;Construction of Steel Superstructure and Other Ancillary <lb/>Works of Rail-cum-road Bridge Across River Ganga at Patna&quot; <lb/>(hereafter the &quot;Project&quot;). <lb/>3. <lb/>Ircon, in turn, issued a Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) on <lb/>27.06.2008, in respect of works pertaining to &quot;Fabrication of 17 x 123 <lb/>m + 2 x 64m triangulated steel bridge girders for new rail-cum-road <lb/>bridge over river Ganges (Ganga) at Patna by setting up of field <lb/>workshop on the Dighaghat end (South End) of river Ganges including <lb/>leading of structural steel from Fatuha Stockyard, shop painting and <lb/>trail assemble of one span of each type in the shop as a complete job&quot;, <lb/>arising out of the aforesaid Project. <lb/>4. <lb/>The respondent was declared as the lowest bidder and <lb/>accordingly, Ircon issued a Letter of Award (LoA) dated 22.08.2008 in <lb/>favour of the respondent for execution of the aforesaid works, for a total <lb/>contract value of ₹135.39 crores. <lb/>5. <lb/>Subsequently, on 22.01.2009, the parties entered into a Contract <lb/>bearing number IRCON/2044/Ganga Bridge/05 for &quot;Fabrication of 17 <lb/>x 123 m + 2 x 64m span triangulated steel bridge girders for new rail-<lb/>cum-road bridge over river Ganges (Ganga) at Patna&quot; (hereafter the <lb/>&quot;Fabrication Contract&quot;). <lb/>6. <lb/>Thereafter, on 27.03.2009, the parties also entered into a Contract <lb/>bearing number IRCON/2044/Ganga Bridge/07 for &quot;Assemble, <lb/>Erection/Launching of 18 x 123 m + 1 x 64m span triangulated steel <lb/>girders for new Rail-Cum-Road bridge across river Ganga at Patna <lb/></body>

			<body>from Digha Ghat end (South End) including transportation of <lb/>fabricated components of (17 X 123 m + 1 X 64m)&quot; (hereafter the <lb/>&quot;Erection Contract&quot;) for a total contract value of ₹107.08 crores. <lb/>7. <lb/>The Fabrication Contract and the Erection Contract are hereafter <lb/>collectively referred to as the &quot;Contracts&quot;. <lb/>8. <lb/>In terms of the Fabrication Contract, the works were to <lb/>commence on 22.08.2008 and were to be completed within a period of <lb/>forty-two months, that is, on or before 21.02.2012. Admittedly, the <lb/>respondent completed the said works on 30.09.2015. <lb/>9. <lb/>In respect of the Erection Contract, the works were to commence <lb/>on 18.02.2009 and were to be completed within a period of forty-five <lb/>months, that is, on or before 17.11.2012. However, works in respect of <lb/>the Erection Contract were completed by the respondent after a period <lb/>of eighty-six months from the date of commencement of the said <lb/>Contract, that is, on 30.04.2016. <lb/>10. <lb/>The respondent claimed that there was a delay in completion of <lb/>the works under the Contracts for reasons attributable to Ircon as a result <lb/>of which, it had suffered financial hardships and incurred heavy losses. <lb/>Ircon, on the other hand, claimed that the respondent was responsible <lb/>for the delay in performance of the Contracts. <lb/>11. <lb/>In view of the disputes between the parties, a meeting was held <lb/>on 10.09.2015 and certain issues were settled as recorded in the Minutes <lb/>of the Meeting dated 10.09.2015. <lb/></body>

			<body>12. On 13.12.2016, the respondent executed a No Claim Certificate <lb/>(hereafter &quot;NCC&quot;). Ircon states that in lieu of the NCC, all claims of <lb/>the respondent were settled and thus, the respondent was precluded <lb/>from raising any further claims. <lb/>13. However, the respondent by its letter dated 25.01.2018 raised <lb/>additional claims for losses suffered by it due to Ircon&apos;s failure of <lb/>performing its obligations in a timely manner under the Contracts. The <lb/>respondent received no response to the aforesaid letter by Ircon. <lb/>Thereafter, by a letter dated 27.03.2018, the respondent invoked the <lb/>Arbitration Agreement and sought reference of the disputes to <lb/>arbitration. The respondent claimed an amount of ₹50,95,18,949/-in <lb/>respect of the Fabrication Contract and an amount of ₹35,26,10,345/-<lb/>under the Erection Contract. <lb/>14. <lb/>By the impugned award, the Arbitral Tribunal partly allowed the <lb/>claims of the respondent. A tabular statement of the claims allowed by <lb/>the Arbitral Tribunal under the Fabrication Contract and Erection <lb/>Contract is set out below: <lb/>Fabrication Contract <lb/>Claim No. 7 -Claim for idling costs <lb/>incurred and extra works done by the <lb/>claimant till the revised zero date i.e. <lb/>01.02.2010 <lb/>₹1,78,00,000/-<lb/></body>

			<body>Claim No. 10 -Claim for excess cost <lb/>incurred by the Claimant in extension <lb/>of bank guarantees <lb/>Nil <lb/>[Modified to ₹35,59,764/-<lb/>by the Arbitral Tribunal <lb/>under Section 33 of the <lb/>A&amp;C Act] <lb/>Submissions <lb/>15. Mr. Doval, learned counsel appearing for Ircon has confined the <lb/>challenge to the impugned award on three grounds. First, he submitted <lb/>that the Arbitral Tribunal&apos;s decision to accept the NCC submitted by the <lb/>respondent as conditional and not binding, is patently illegal. He <lb/>submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had grossly erred in not <lb/>appreciating that the NCC was issued at a time when bulk of the <lb/>payments had already been made. He submitted that almost 99.65% of <lb/>the amounts payable under the Fabrication Contract were paid until <lb/>13.12.2016. Similarly, approximately 99.47% of the payments in <lb/>respect of the Erection Contract were made by 13.12.2016. Thus, less <lb/>than 1% of the total amount remained outstanding on the date on which <lb/>the respondent had furnished the NCC. He contended that this clearly <lb/>indicated that no economic pressure was exerted on the respondent by <lb/>withholding the admitted amounts. <lb/>16. He further contended that even though the Arbitral Tribunal had <lb/>concluded that the respondent was in need of funds, Ircon was not <lb/>responsible for the respondent&apos;s financial condition. Therefore, the <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 273/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 7 of 19 <lb/></page>

			<body>Arbitral Tribunal&apos;s conclusion that the respondent was not precluded <lb/>from agitating its claims notwithstanding the execution of the NCC, is <lb/>manifestly erroneous. <lb/>17. Second, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had grossly erred <lb/>in awarding the claims regarding prolongation of work merely on the <lb/>basis of a Certificate issued by a Chartered Accountant. The Certificate <lb/>of the Chartered Accountant [Annexure C(F)-A-35] was denied by <lb/>Ircon and therefore, it was necessary for the respondent to prove its <lb/>contents. Additionally, the author of the said Certificate (Chartered <lb/>Accountant) was not examined and therefore, the quantification of the <lb/>claims awarded to the respondent on the basis of the said Certificate is <lb/>without evidence. He submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had also erred <lb/>in not observing that Ircon had challenged the said Certificate. He stated <lb/>that on the contrary, Ircon had not only denied the Certificate of the <lb/>Chartered Accountant but denied the contents of the said Certificate as <lb/>well. <lb/>18. Third, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had grossly erred <lb/>in awarding claims, which were premised on the basis of delay in <lb/>completion of the works as the Arbitral Tribunal had concluded that <lb/>both parties were responsible for the delay. He submitted that having <lb/>found that the respondent was also responsible for delay in completion <lb/>of the works, there is no question of awarding the respondent any <lb/>compensation on account of such delay. <lb/></body>

			<body>19. Mr. Gaurab Banerji, learned senior counsel appearing for the <lb/>respondent countered the aforesaid submissions. He submitted that the <lb/>covering letter under which the NCC was furnished to Ircon, clearly <lb/>indicated that the respondent had executed the NCC involuntarily and, <lb/>the same was not unconditional. <lb/>20. Next, he submitted that the Certificate of the Chartered <lb/>Accountant was supported with voluminous documents including bills <lb/>and vouchers establishing quantification of the amounts as reflected in <lb/>the Certificate of the Chartered Accountant. He submitted that the said <lb/>documents have not been filed by Ircon before this court but were part <lb/>of the said Certificate [Annexure C(F)-A-35]. <lb/>21. Lastly, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had examined the <lb/>question of compensation payable for delay in execution of the <lb/>Contracts and had used the principle of apportionment. He stated that <lb/>the same is permissible in law and therefore, the impugned award <lb/>cannot be assailed on this ground. <lb/>Reasons and Conclusion <lb/>22. At the outset, it is relevant to note that although it is averred in <lb/>the petition that the impugned award is contrary to the provisions of the <lb/>Contracts; Mr. Doval did not advance any submissions in this regard. <lb/>He confined the challenge to the impugned award to the three grounds <lb/>as stated above. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 273/2021 <lb/></note>

			<body>23. Clause 49.5 of the GCC provides that in the event of any delay <lb/>on the part of Ircon or the Engineer, the time for completing the <lb/>Contracts would be reasonably extended but no damages would be <lb/>payable to the respondent. Before the Arbitral Tribunal, it was <lb/>contended on behalf of Ircon that no compensation on account of delay <lb/>is payable to the respondent in view of the said Clause. <lb/>24. The interpretation of the said clause was debated before the <lb/>Arbitral Tribunal. The respondent had relied on the decision of the <lb/>Supreme Court in Asian Techs Ltd. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.: (2009) <lb/>10 SCC 354 in support of the contention that the exclusionary clause <lb/>was required to be read in a restrictive manner and would not be <lb/>applicable in case of a loss resulting due to an unreasonable delay. The <lb/>respondent had also relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in <lb/>Board of Trustees for the Port of Calcutta v. Engineers-De-Space-<lb/>Age: (1996) 1 SCC 516 and contended that such exclusionary clause <lb/>would only bind the department and not the Arbitrator. Ircon had also <lb/>relied upon certain decisions including the decision of the Supreme <lb/>Court in Syed Israr Masood, Forest Contractor, Ret Ghat, Bhopal v. <lb/>State of Madhya Pradesh: (1981) 4 SCC 289 and Associated <lb/>Engineering Co. v. Govt. of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Anr.: (1991) 4 SCC <lb/>93. <lb/>25. The Arbitral Tribunal had considered the aforesaid decisions and <lb/>in addition also referred to other decisions including a decision of this <lb/>Court in Simplex Concrete Piles (India) Ltd. v. Union of India: 2010 <lb/>(115) DRJ 616 wherein this Court had examined the validity of such <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 273/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 10 of 19 <lb/></page>

			<body>clauses in the context of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. <lb/>After considering the controversy, the Arbitral Tribunal had concluded <lb/>that Clause 49.5 of the GCC did not prohibit the Arbitrator from <lb/>entertaining a claim in regard to compensation. The Arbitral Tribunal <lb/>held that Clause 49.5 of the GCC would be applicable only in cases of <lb/>reasonable delay. The Arbitral Tribunal held that the said clause would <lb/>not be applicable where the delay is unreasonable and of a long <lb/>duration. The Arbitral Tribunal held that in the present case, the delay <lb/>was abnormal and therefore, the exclusionary clause (Clause 49.5 of the <lb/>GCC) would not preclude the respondent from raising a claim for <lb/>compensation. The Arbitral Tribunal was of the view that a &apos;Business <lb/>Efficacy Test&apos; was required to be applied while considering the <lb/>exclusionary clause. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal drew strength <lb/>from the decision of the Supreme Court in Nabha Power Ltd. v. Punjab <lb/>State Power Corporation Limited &amp; Anr.: (2018) 11 SCC 508. <lb/>26. It is well settled that the question as to interpretation of a clause <lb/>of a contract falls within the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal. The <lb/>decision of the arbitral tribunal cannot be interfered with unless the <lb/>same is found to be patently illegal or in conflict with the Public Policy <lb/>of India. <lb/>27. In the instance case, the view expressed by the Arbitral Tribunal <lb/>is a plausible one. It was accepted on behalf of Ircon that Courts have <lb/>taken divergent views in respect of applicability and interpretation of <lb/>exclusionary clauses. Clearly, the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, <lb/>accepting one view, cannot be construed as implausible or one that no <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 11 of 19 <lb/></page>

			<body>reasonable person can by any stretch of imagination consider to be <lb/>implausible or one that no reasonable person would hold. Mr Doval has <lb/>thus fairly not assailed the impugned award as contrary to the terms of <lb/>the Contracts. <lb/>28. The contention that the impugned award is vitiated by patent <lb/>illegality as the Arbitral Tribunal had accepted Ircon&apos;s contention that <lb/>the Contracts were discharged by accord and satisfaction is unmerited. <lb/>It was the respondent&apos;s case that the NCC was issued by it under <lb/>economic duress and not voluntarily. Thus, one of the principal <lb/>questions that fell for consideration before the Arbitral Tribunal was <lb/>whether the respondent had furnished the NCC under duress or <lb/>voluntarily. <lb/>29. Ircon had filed an application under Section 16 of the A&amp;C Act <lb/>on the ground that the Contracts were discharged by accord and <lb/>satisfaction. The respondent had contested the same on the ground that <lb/>it had furnished the NCC under duress. The covering letter under which <lb/>the NCC was furnished also clearly indicated that the respondent did <lb/>not intend to give up its claims. In view of the rival contentions, the <lb/>Arbitral Tribunal had by an order dated 06.02.2019 rejected the <lb/>application under Section 16 of the A&amp;C Act. However, the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal had also observed that the question whether the respondent had <lb/>furnished the NCC under duress or voluntarily, would be determined at <lb/>the final stage. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 273/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 12 of 19 <lb/></page>

			<body>30. A reading of the impugned award indicates that the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal had discussed the law on the subject and also examined the <lb/>facts of the case. The Arbitral Tribunal noted that the respondent&apos;s <lb/>claim was largely due to (a) prolongation of the Contracts; (b) claims <lb/>arising in respect of measurement of certain items; and (c) claims on <lb/>account of extra works. The respondent had communicated its <lb/>grievance and had highlighted the issues on several occasions during <lb/>the course of execution of the works. The parties had also attempted to <lb/>discuss and settle the issues amicably. The Arbitral Tribunal noted that <lb/>a meeting was held between the parties on 10.09.2015 to settle the <lb/>issues. The Arbitral Tribunal was of the view that the decisions taken <lb/>at the said meeting were voluntary and without any coercion. Thus, the <lb/>issues that were settled at the said meeting could not be reopened. <lb/>However, insofar as the issues that were not settled, it was difficult to <lb/>accept that the respondent had voluntarily waived its outstanding claims <lb/>which it was diligently pursuing with Ircon. Some of the claims that <lb/>remained pending were specifically mentioned by the respondent in the <lb/>letters dated 09.12.2016 (that is, barely four days prior to furnishing the <lb/>NCC). The Arbitral Tribunal noted that even at that stage, the <lb/>respondent had stated that it may have other claims which were under <lb/>preparation. The Arbitral Tribunal also noted the following assertion <lb/>made by the respondent in its letters dated 09.12.2016: <lb/>&quot;…..In this connection, we have now been advised <lb/>to sign a &quot;No Claim&quot; Certificate in favour of <lb/>IRCON as per the attached proforma. We are <lb/>further given to understand that the due payments <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 273/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 13 of 19 <lb/></page>

			<body>will be released only after submission of the <lb/>certificate.&quot; <lb/>31. In view of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that it was <lb/>discernable from the letters that certain claims were under preparation <lb/>and the respondent had clearly indicated that it would be preferring <lb/>those claims. The Arbitral Tribunal was of the view that the NCC was <lb/>required to be examined along with the covering letter under which it <lb/>was sent. Apart from the above, the Arbitral Tribunal was also of the <lb/>view that the respondent was in need of money and was facing financial <lb/>stress and Ircon had withheld certain payments due to the respondent, <lb/>in addition to levying liquidated damages. The findings of the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal in this regard are relevant and are reproduced below: <lb/>&quot;10.56 I am also of the view that the Claimant was <lb/>in need of money and was facing financial <lb/>stress. The amount payable to the Claimant <lb/>at that time cannot be considered vis-à-vis <lb/>the total amount of the contract and the <lb/>amount which had already been paid, which <lb/>was the contention of the learned Counsel <lb/>for the Respondent. Ground realities as on <lb/>the date of signing the NCC have to be <lb/>looked into. The contract had been stretched <lb/>for more than three years which is quite <lb/>considerable having regard to the original <lb/>time for completion of the project stated in <lb/>the contract. Because of this prolongation, <lb/>the Claimant felt that it was entitled to <lb/>escalation amount in terms of Clause 59.3 of <lb/>the contract. This prolongation had also <lb/>contributed towards increase in overhead <lb/>costs. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 273/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 14 of 19 <lb/></page>

			<body>10.57 The Respondent had withheld certain <lb/>payments and had also recovered amount on <lb/>account of Liquidated Damages which the <lb/>Respondent was ready to refund back only <lb/>on signing of NCC. Threat of invocation of <lb/>Bank Guarantees also loomed large. Under <lb/>these circumstances, when the Claimant <lb/>signed the NCC, in order to receive the <lb/>payments of the amount which the <lb/>Respondent had agreed to, it cannot be said <lb/>that NCC was given voluntarily. Be as it <lb/>may, as already mentioned above, covering <lb/>letter dated 09.12.2016 itself states that the <lb/>Claimant was signing as it was given to <lb/>understand that payment would be released <lb/>only after submission of the Certificate. The <lb/>Claimant was, therefore, faced with <lb/>Honson&apos;s choice -either to receive whatever <lb/>is offered by signing NCC or to refuse to sign <lb/>NCC and raise the claims. Latter alternative <lb/>would have resulted in withholding the <lb/>payment, non-refund of Liquidated <lb/>Damages and even invocation of Bank <lb/>Guarantees. All these could be part of the <lb/>claims to be raised by the Claimant in that <lb/>even along with other claims which the <lb/>Claimant has raised now, making the <lb/>Claimant to await the passing of the award <lb/>by the Arbitral Tribunal. If the Claimant <lb/>chose the first alternative by signing the <lb/>NCC, but at the same time made it clear in <lb/>the covering letter that it would be preferring <lb/>some other claims, I am of the view that the <lb/>singing of the NCCs cannot preclude <lb/>Claimant from making further claims.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>32. The contention that the Arbitral Tribunal has failed to appreciate <lb/>that only a small fraction of the total admitted amount was payable by <lb/>Ircon at the material time, is unpersuasive. <lb/>33. It is clear that Arbitral Tribunal had examined various facets of <lb/>the disputes and has taken an informed decision. The scope of <lb/>interference on the ground of patent illegality under Section 34(2A) of <lb/>the A&amp;C Act does not extend to re-appreciating the material before the <lb/>Arbitral Tribunal and re-adjudicating the disputes. <lb/>34. The contention that the impugned award is vitiated by patent <lb/>illegality as it is based on no evidence is also unmerited. It is necessary <lb/>to bear in mind that the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the strict rules <lb/>of evidence are inapplicable to arbitral proceedings. The Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal is required to render a decision after evaluating the material <lb/>placed before it. <lb/>35. In the present case, the respondent had supported its claim by <lb/>furnishing a Certificate of an independent Chartered Accountant <lb/>[Annexure C(F)-A-35]. A plain reading of the said Certificate indicates <lb/>that it was accompanied by Statement of Administrative and other <lb/>Overhead Expenses. Further, the concerned Chartered Accountant had <lb/>also certified that he had examined the same from various books and <lb/>accounts maintained by the respondent including vouchers, bank <lb/>statements, bills, invoices, as well as other relevant supporting records <lb/>and documents maintained by the respondent. The Arbitral Tribunal had <lb/>accepted the said Certificate. Although, the author of the said Certificate <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">O.M.P. (COMM) 273/2021 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 16 of 19 <lb/></page>

			<body>was not examined, the concerned officer of the respondent had <lb/>produced the said Certificate and duly affirmed the quantification. As <lb/>noted above, strict rules of evidence do not apply to arbitral proceedings <lb/>and there is considerable discretion available with the Arbitral Tribunal <lb/>to take a view on the quality and the sufficiency of evidence. The <lb/>contention that the impugned award is required to be set aside on the <lb/>ground that quantification of certain claims awarded in favour of the <lb/>respondent is without any material, is unmerited. <lb/>36. Mr. Doval had earnestly contended that Ircon had denied the <lb/>aforesaid Certificate as well as its contents. However, Ircon had not <lb/>disputed the said Certificate apart from making a bald denial in the <lb/>Statement of Admission and Denial. The petitioner also did not raise <lb/>any specific objection regarding the reasonableness of the expenditure <lb/>as mentioned in the Certificate of the independent Chartered <lb/>Accountant including the Statement of Expenses forming part of the <lb/>said Certificate. <lb/>37. As noticed above, the respondent&apos;s claim was premised mainly <lb/>on account of prolongation of works. Admittedly, the respondent was <lb/>present at site and had executed the works. It is obvious that the <lb/>respondent had incurred expenses on account of administrative charges <lb/>and overhead expenses during the period of prolongation of the works. <lb/>If Ircon would have found any of the expenditure to be exorbitant or <lb/>unreasonable, it was certainly open for Ircon to have raised that <lb/>objection. The observation made by the Arbitral Tribunal to the effect <lb/>that Ircon had not raised any specific challenge must be read in that <lb/></body>

			<body>context. The said observation cannot be read to mean that Ircon had <lb/>admitted the expenditure as claimed. It merely means that Ircon had not <lb/>&quot;specifically laid any challenge to the details so provided&quot; by the <lb/>respondent. <lb/>38. Lastly, the contention that the impugned award is vitiated by <lb/>patent illegality as the Arbitral Tribunal has awarded claims on account <lb/>of delay in completion of the works despite holding that the respondent <lb/>was partly responsible for the same, is unmerited. The Arbitral Tribunal <lb/>found that there were delays on the part of Ircon in handing over the <lb/>site. The site was required to be levelled and the work of earth filling <lb/>continued till March, 2009. The site for the first workshop after <lb/>levelling was handed over in January, 2009 and the site for the second <lb/>workshop was handed over by April, 2009. However, in terms of Clause <lb/>13 of the Additional Special Conditions of Contract (ASCC) read with <lb/>its corrigendum, the site was required to be handed over within a period <lb/>of 15 days from 06.09.2008. In view of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal <lb/>concluded that there was delay in handing over of the site. The Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal also found that there was inordinate delay in handing over of <lb/>the GFC drawings. This was a fundamental obligation on the part of <lb/>Ircon and the same was breached. The Arbitral Tribunal also held that <lb/>the respondent could not continue certain preparatory work in the <lb/>absence of the requisite drawings. <lb/>39. The Arbitral Tribunal accepted that there was certain delay on the <lb/>part of the respondent as well. However, the Arbitral Tribunal <lb/>concluded that the delays on the part of Ircon were in respect of &quot;critical <lb/></body>

			<body>aspects&quot; and the said delays were dominant in prolongation of the <lb/>works. The conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal in this regard is set out <lb/>below: <lb/>&quot;10.160. The <lb/>Respondent <lb/>has <lb/>committed <lb/>fundamental breaches in not providing site for <lb/>construction of workshop etc. in time. Further <lb/>there has been abnormal delay I providing good <lb/>GFC for construction drawings. Delay was also <lb/>caused because of change in drawings from time to <lb/>time. Like-wise, absence of incorporation of <lb/>strengthening provisions in the drawings too <lb/>caused the delay. The timeless, as specified in the <lb/>contract, were not adhered to. There were some <lb/>other delays caused by the Respondent. It is also <lb/>recorded that there were initial delays on the part <lb/>of the Claimant as well as insofar as preparatory <lb/>work is concerned as the signing of the contract <lb/>itself was delayed due to non-submission of <lb/>Performance Security, Bank Guarantee for <lb/>mobilization advance, etc. An overall picture <lb/>which emerges is that for significant part of the <lb/>contract, there is contributory / concurrent delay on <lb/>the part of Claimant as well which happened <lb/>parallel during the project. However, certain <lb/>delays occurred solely because of the non-<lb/>fulfillment of obligations by the Respondent.&quot; <lb/>40. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that given that the parties had <lb/>contributed to certain delays, it was essential to apply the principle of <lb/>apportionment. After evaluating the reasons for the delay, the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal concluded that half of the delay could be apportioned to both <lb/>Ircon and the respondent. However, for the remaining half, Ircon was <lb/>solely responsible for the same. Therefore, only half of the claim made <lb/></body>

			<body>by the respondent on account of idling costs was allowed by the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal. The relevant paragraph of the impugned award embodying <lb/>the said conclusion is set out below: <lb/>&quot;10.171 Keeping in view all the aforesaid <lb/>considerations, I am of the view that the Claimant <lb/>would be entitled to the losses suffered by it because <lb/>of certain fundamental delays on the part of the <lb/>Respondent, but at the same time, the claim <lb/>preferred by the Claimant to be reduced by applying <lb/>the principle of apportionment because of the reason <lb/>that to some extent, delays are caused due to the <lb/>factors attributable to the Claimant itself. After <lb/>considering the overall circumstances, the period of <lb/>delay solely attributable to the Respondent is <lb/>reduced to half, as for the other period, the Claimant <lb/>is also liable and therefore, cannot take advantage. <lb/>The Claims for compensation on the ground of delay <lb/>are adjudicated on this yardstick.&quot; <lb/>41. This Court finds no infirmity in the approach of the Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal. The contention that the same is contrary to law is unmerited. <lb/>This Court is unable to accept that the impugned award requires any <lb/>interference in this proceeding. <lb/>42. The petition is accordingly dismissed. The pending applications <lb/>are also disposed of. <lb/>VIBHU BAKHRU, J <lb/>MARCH 25, 2022 <lb/>&apos;gsr&apos; </body>
