			<body>New Delhi. <lb/>3. <lb/>The prosecution case is based upon the statement of one Rajpal, <lb/>who was working as a Security Guard at Liquor Shop at Pitampura, <lb/>Delhi. It is alleged that on 13.3.2015, at about 2.30 am three boys <lb/>came there and one of them put a knife on his neck and threatened <lb/>him to kill if he raised alarm. It is further stated by the complainant <lb/>that one of them pressed his mount and the other boy caught hold of <lb/>his hands and forcibly took him inside the liquor shop, where he <lb/>found that 5 more boys were present. When police siren rang, all the <lb/>eight boys fled away and while fleeing from the spot, a mobile phone <lb/>of one of those boys fell down, which resulted in apprehending three <lb/>persons including the petitioner herein. During investigation, names <lb/>of other accused persons were disclosed but they could not be arrested <lb/>even after issuance of NBW and were preceded under Section 82/83 <lb/>of Cr. P.C., but somehow succeeded in obtaining interim protection <lb/>from this Court subject to their joining the investigation. <lb/>4. <lb/>It is further the case of the prosecution that during <lb/>investigation, the petitioner was granted interim bail for two weeks <lb/>and also filed a petition for quashing of the FIR on the ground of <lb/></body>

			<body>settlement arrived at between the parties, but the same was later on <lb/>withdrawn. As per prosecution case, through the petitioner has no <lb/>other previous criminal involvement but there is a recovery of 50 <lb/>cases/cartons of looted liquor from the petitioner. <lb/>5. <lb/>While arguing the case of the petitioner, Mr. Deepak Prakash, <lb/>Advocate contended that there is neither any mention of his name in <lb/>the FIR nor any role is attributed or described in the statement of the <lb/>complainant. It is further contended that even in the Test <lb/>Identification Parade, the petitioner was not identified. The petitioner <lb/>is stated to be in custody since 15.03.2015 and the charge sheet in the <lb/>case has also been filed. <lb/>6. <lb/>Counsel for the petitioner strongly urged that even if the <lb/>prosecution case is admitted in toto, the only offence which can be <lb/>alleged against the petitioner is under Section 411 of IPC and the <lb/>prosecution has falsely registered the case under Section 395/397 of <lb/>IPC. <lb/>7. <lb/>Counsel for the petitioner also urged that the other co-accused <lb/>have either been granted bail or obtained interim protection in this <lb/>case and also claims that the petitioner be also granted bail on the <lb/></body>

			<body>ground of parity as well. It is further stated that the charge sheet in the <lb/>case has been filed and the petitioner is no more required for any <lb/>custodial interrogation. It is further submitted that the petitioner is a <lb/>married man and running various businesses and till date no offence <lb/>has been committed by him and there is no chance to flee from <lb/>justice, therefore the petitioner/applicant ought to be granted bail in <lb/>the aforesaid case. <lb/>8. <lb/>To oppose the contentions raised by learned counsel for the <lb/>petitioner, Ms. Manjeet Arya, learned Additional Public Prosecutor <lb/>for the State submitted that the conduct of the application, as observed <lb/>by the learned Trial Court, that he did not appear before the court on <lb/>21.7.2015 and 23.07.2015, even without moving application for <lb/>seeking exemption from personal appearance. Consequently, the trial <lb/>court had issued NBWs against the petitioner and on 23.7.2015 <lb/>neither petitioner nor his surety had appeared before the court, despite <lb/>service of notice. Therefore, there is apprehension of the petitioner <lb/>jumping the bail, if granted. <lb/>9. <lb/>The submissions and counter submissions made by Counsel for <lb/>the petitioner as well as by learned Additional Public Prosecutor for <lb/></body>

			<body>the State have been heard and perused the material placed on record. <lb/>10. =take instructions from HMJ <lb/>11. (=if granted) <lb/>12. After considering the contents of the present petition as well as <lb/>the status report filed on record, this Court observes that the petitioner <lb/>is in custody since 16.3.2015 and the other accused persons have <lb/>either been granted bail or have been granted interim protection <lb/>against their arrest. Charge sheet in this case has been filed and the <lb/>same is now fixed for framing of charge. This court also observes that <lb/>there is recovery of 50 cases/cartons of looted liquor from the <lb/>petitioner. <lb/>13. This court also observes that though the petitioner is charged <lb/>with the offence punishable under Section 395/397 of the IPC, <lb/>however, during TIP in jail on 18.03.2015, the complainant did not <lb/>identify the petitioner, despite the fact that the complainant had stated <lb/>in his statement that he can identify the persons who committed the <lb/>offence. It is also admitted case of the State that the co-accused in the <lb/>present case are either granted bail or obtained interim protection in <lb/>this case. <lb/></body>

			<body>14. From the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, this <lb/>Court take note of the facts; that the co-accused -Deepak Chaudhary <lb/>of the present case has already granted bail; the fact that during TIP, <lb/>the petitioner is not identified by the complainant of the FIR in <lb/>question; the fact that the petitioner is in custody since 15.03.2015; <lb/>Charge sheet in the present case has already been filed, therefore the <lb/>petitioner is no more required for further investigation and the trial is <lb/>likely to take time. <lb/>15. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, this court is <lb/>inclined to grant bail to the petitioner -Hari Singh in the present case <lb/>subject to his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.20,000/-with <lb/>two sureties of the like amount, to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. <lb/>16. Needless to say that anything observed in this order shall not <lb/>have any bearing on merits of the case during trial. <lb/>17. With aforesaid direction, the present bail application as well as <lb/>pending applications, filed by the petitioner stand disposed of. <lb/>18.
