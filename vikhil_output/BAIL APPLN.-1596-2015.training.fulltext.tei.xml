Consequently, the trial<lb/> court had issued NBWs against the petitioner and on 23.7.2015<lb/> neither petitioner nor his surety had appeared before the court, despite<lb/> service of notice. Therefore, there is apprehension of the petitioner<lb/> jumping the bail, if granted.<lb/> 9.<lb/> The submissions and counter submissions made by Counsel for<lb/> the petitioner as well as by learned Additional Public Prosecutor for<lb/> the State have been heard and perused the material placed on record.<lb/> 10. =take instructions from HMJ<lb/> 11.
