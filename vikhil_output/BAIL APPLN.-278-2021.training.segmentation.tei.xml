			<body>3. <lb/>Status Report has been filed. The status report states that the petitioner <lb/>had previously been involved in many cases of theft, snatching and robbery <lb/>and there are total 19 cases registered against him. <lb/>4. <lb/>Mr. Firoz Iqbal Khan, learned counsel for the petitioner would state <lb/>that when the petitioner was arrested in FIR No.361/19, at that point of time <lb/>the report showed that the petitioner was involved only in two cases which <lb/>were FIR No. 601/ 15 Police Station, Daryaganj where the petitioner was on <lb/>bail and FIR No.45/2015 Police Station, Shastri Park Metro Station, Delhi <lb/>where according to records the petitioner had already been discharged on <lb/>23.12.2017 even before the alleged arrest. He contends that after his arrest in <lb/>FIR No.361/19 and before the petitioner moved his present bail application <lb/>in the present case, the petitioner has been shown to have been involved in <lb/>19 cases out of which the petitioner has been shown to have been discharged <lb/>in 12 cases. He would state that the petitioner has now been discharged in 14 <lb/>out of 19 cases. The learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contends <lb/>that the petitioner has been falsely implicated by the Police only to show that <lb/>the Police have successfully investigated 19 cases. He would contend that <lb/>the fact that the petitioner has been discharged in 14 out of 19 cases shows <lb/>the hollowness in the claim of the Police. The learned counsel for the <lb/>petitioner vehemently contends that in FIR No.361/19 the petitioner was <lb/>identified by the complainant in the corridor of the Karkardooma Courts and <lb/>in the same manner the petitioner has been identified in this case also. He <lb/>would further state that in FIR No.361/19 the complainant has turned hostile <lb/>and had refused to identify the petitioner in the Court. He would state that <lb/></body>

			<body>the Police have been implicating the petitioner in case after case by making <lb/>the victims identify the petitioner. It is contended by the learned counsel for <lb/>the petitioner that once the identity of the petitioner was revealed, no <lb/>adverse influence could be drawn against the petitioner for refusing to <lb/>participate in TIP. He also contends that self-incriminating statements made <lb/>by the petitioner admitting to his guilt cannot be used against him at all. He <lb/>would state that the petitioner is in judicial custody in the present case from <lb/>23.11.2019. He would therefore contend that the petitioner is entitled to bail. <lb/>5. <lb/>The Status Report and a reply dated 15.03.2021 had been filed by the <lb/>State. It is contended by Ms. Meenakshi Chauhan, the learned APP that the <lb/>petitioner is accused of a grievous offence punishable under Section 307 <lb/>IPC. She would contend that the petitioner had repeatedly stabbed the <lb/>victims. She contends that in the present case after the petitioner was sent to <lb/>the judicial custody he was brought only in muffled face. She states that he <lb/>has been identified by the complainant and there is no reason for the <lb/>complainant to falsely identify the petitioner herein. There is no enmity <lb/>between the petitioner and the complainants and that it is inconceivable that <lb/>the complainants would falsely identify the petitioner only to help the <lb/>Police. <lb/>6. <lb/>As rightly stated by Ms. Meenakshi Chauhan, the learned APP, there <lb/>is no reason for the complainant to falsely identify the petitioner in Court <lb/>and there is no previous enmity between the parties. A reading of the <lb/>charge-sheet would show that there is sufficient material against the <lb/>petitioner. The fact that the petitioner was identified in the Court by the <lb/></body>

			<body>victim cannot be found fault with and it cannot be said that the petitioner is <lb/>being falsely implicated in case after case. The fact that the complainant in <lb/>FIR No.361/19 has turned hostile in trial is of no consequence in the present <lb/>case. <lb/>7. <lb/>Looking into the nature of the offence and that the petitioner is <lb/>alleged of stabbing the victims multiple times, this Court is not inclined to <lb/>grant bail to the petitioner at this juncture. The possibility of the petitioner <lb/>coming out and threatening the complainants and tampering with evidence <lb/>cannot be ruled out. This Court is not inclined to accept the version of the <lb/>petitioner that he has been implicated by Police in case after case. The <lb/>material shows that the petitioner&apos;s involvement is there in 19 cases and he <lb/>had been enlarged in most of the cases because of lack of proper evidence. <lb/>8. <lb/>The Trial Court is directed to proceed ahead with the matter and <lb/>examine the complainant at the earliest preferably not later than six months <lb/>from today. <lb/>9. <lb/>Accordingly, the bail application is dismissed with the above <lb/>observations. <lb/>SUBRAMONIUM PRASAD, J. <lb/>APRIL 28, 2021 <lb/>Rahul </body>
