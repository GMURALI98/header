Respondent/Applicant <lb/>Through: Mr.B.R.Sharma, Advocate <lb/>CORAM: <lb/>HON&apos;BLE MS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA <lb/>JUDGMENT <lb/></front>

			<body>1. <lb/>This Petition has been filed by M/s Millennium Realtech Private <lb/>Limited for the review of the order dated 18.11.2014. <lb/>2. <lb/>The brief background of the case is that the petitioner i.e. M/s Opaque <lb/>Infrastructure Private Limited had filed an O.M.P.No.745/2014 under <lb/>Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 with the prayer to <lb/>restrain the applicant i.e. M/s Millennium Realtech Private Limited from <lb/>transferring or in any manner dealing with, selling or parting with <lb/>possession of the plot of land measuring 1148 square yards in Khasra <lb/>No.260 situated in revenue estate of village Bahapur, Tehsil Kalkaji, New <lb/></body>

			<body>Delhi. The parties had entered into a collaboration agreement for the <lb/>construction on the said plot. Pursuant to that collaboration agreement the <lb/>petitioner i.e. M/s Opaque Infrastructure Private Limited had paid a sum of <lb/>`50 lakhs to the respondent/applicant. One of the conditions of the <lb/>collaboration agreement was that the respondent/applicant was required to <lb/>get plan sanctioned from the concerned authorities, which he had failed to <lb/>do. Subsequently, the petitioner i.e. M/s Opaque Infrastructure Private <lb/>Limited had invoked the arbitration clause and filed an application for <lb/>appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration and <lb/>Conciliation Act vide Arb.Pet.No.634/2014. It also moved an application <lb/>under Section 9 being O.M.P.No745/2014 for restraining the applicant to <lb/>dispose of the said property. This court vide order dated 18.11.2014 <lb/>restrained the applicant from creating third party interest in the said property <lb/>in any manner. Aggrieved by this order, the applicant/respondent had <lb/>preferred an appeal being FAO (OS) 503/2014 but withdrew the said appeal. <lb/>The order of the appellate court is reproduced as under: <lb/>&quot;1. Learned counsel for the appellant concedes to the <lb/>point that before the learned Single Judge defence under <lb/>Section 14(b) of the Specific Performance Act, 1963 was <lb/>not pleaded. <lb/>2. Counsel concedes that the contract between the <lb/>parties dated November 07, 2011 requires a building to be <lb/></body>

			<body>constructed from the funds made available by the builder. <lb/>After the building is constructed different areas thereof <lb/>have to be shared between the parties as per Clause-XII of <lb/>the agreement. The quality of the construction has to be as <lb/>per specification in Schedule-B and B1 to the agreement. <lb/>3. <lb/>Whether or not such contract is capable of specific <lb/>performance has concededly not been argued before the <lb/>learned Single Judge. If argued, it would require the <lb/>learned Single Judge to consider whether at all <lb/>the property has to be preserved by way of an interim <lb/>measure pending adjudication of a claim for specific <lb/>performance of the Collaboration Agreement. <lb/>4. <lb/>Faced as aforesaid, learned counsel for the appellant <lb/>seeks leave of this Court to withdraw the appeal with <lb/>liberty to seek a review of the impugned order before the <lb/>learned Single Judge. <lb/>5. The right of review exists in law to the appellant, and <lb/>thus what is conferred by law need not be conferred by a <lb/>judicial order. <lb/>6. So observing, we dismiss the appeal as withdrawn <lb/>observing simultaneously that if the appellant were to file <lb/>an application before the learned Single Judge seeking <lb/>review on the ground above noted the learned Single <lb/>Judge would bestow a consideration thereto as per law.&quot; <lb/>3. <lb/>This order makes it clear that the applicant was permitted to file <lb/>review application on the ground whether the collaboration agreement was <lb/>capable of specific performance or not. <lb/>4. <lb/>The respondent/applicant however has re-agitated the matter even on <lb/>the grounds raised by it earlier before this court and rejected vide impugned <lb/></body>

			<body>order. In view of this background, this court confines itself only to the issue <lb/>relating to the specific performance of the collaboration agreement. <lb/>5. <lb/>It is contended by the respondent/applicant that the collaboration <lb/>agreement cannot be enforced because it is a construction contract of which <lb/>specifications, type of construction, quality and quantity as such details <lb/>minutes which has not been yet settled between the parties, cannot be <lb/>continuously supervised by the court. Reliance has been placed by the <lb/>applicant/respondent on S.B.L.Limited vs. Himalaya Drug Co. AIR 1998 <lb/>Delhi 126. This case law has no relevance on the facts of this case. <lb/>6. <lb/>In reply to the review application it is contended on behalf of the <lb/>petitioner M/s Opaque Infrastructure Private Limited that the same plea had <lb/>been raised by the applicants in Arb.Pet.634/2014 which the petitioners had <lb/>filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the court <lb/>while disposing of the said petition had rejected the said contention of the <lb/>respondent/applicant. The learned counsel has relied on the following <lb/>paragraph of the said order dated 30.01.2015: <lb/>&quot;4. <lb/>The Court is of the view that the above plea of the <lb/>Respondent can be considered by the learned Arbitrator. <lb/>He will also have to consider the alternate prayer for <lb/>damages, in the event the prayer for specific performance <lb/>is declined.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>It is further argued that the issue, whether plea of specific <lb/>performance, raised, is maintainable or not is within the province of the <lb/>learned Arbitrator and this court under Section 9 of the Arbitration and <lb/>Conciliation Act has no jurisdiction and moreover the order in <lb/>Arb.Pet.634/2014 is final (being not challenged) and thus binding. <lb/>7. <lb/>I agree with Mr.Harish Malhotra, learned senior counsel appearing for <lb/>the petitioner. <lb/>8. <lb/>The admitted facts are that there existed a collaboration agreement <lb/>between the parties containing an arbitration clause and when the disputes <lb/>arose between the parties, the petitioner i.e. M/s Opaque Infrastructure <lb/>Private Limited had sought intervention of the court under Section 11 of the <lb/>Arbitration and Conciliation Act for appointment of an arbitration by way of <lb/>Arb.Pet.364/2014 and this court had appointed the arbitrator and referred all <lb/>the disputes including the plea of the applicant that the contract in question <lb/>was not enforceable in view of the provisions of Specific Relief Act and also <lb/>the alternate prayer for damages, for adjudication to the learned arbitrator. <lb/>The plea raised before this court relating to specific performance of contract <lb/>now is already a subject matter before the arbitrator, on which Arbitral <lb/>Tribunal will give its findings. <lb/></body>

			<body>9. <lb/>By entering into an arbitration agreement the parties had mutually <lb/>agreed to refer all their disputes relating to the collaboration agreement to <lb/>the Arbitral Tribunal. This also includes the enforceability of the Contract. <lb/>By entering into the agreement parties have ousted the jurisdiction of the <lb/>civil court to deal with such disputes which is the subject matter of the <lb/>arbitration agreement. This court therefore cannot enter into the question <lb/>whether the collaboration agreement was enforceable or not. <lb/>10. In view of the foregoing reasons, the present review petition has no <lb/>merit, the same is dismissed. <lb/>DEEPA SHARMA <lb/>(JUDGE) <lb/>AUGUST 20, 2015 <lb/>rb </body>
