			<body>projected himself as the owner of a large share of land whereas he owned <lb/>only a small portion of land. <lb/>3. <lb/>I have heard learned senior counsel for the petitioner and learned APP <lb/>for the State duly assisted by the counsel for the complainant and perused <lb/>the records of the case. <lb/>4. <lb/>It is submitted by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the <lb/>matter is predominantly civil in nature. It is further submitted by her that all <lb/>the documents pertaining to the title of the property in question are in <lb/>possession of the investigating officer, therefore, the custodial interrogation <lb/>is not required as the case pertains to the allegation of cheating and the <lb/>documents speaks for itself which are in power and possession of the <lb/>investigating officer. It is further submitted that petitioner was the owner of <lb/>the property in question as on 15.12.2015 i.e. the date of execution of the <lb/>agreement to sell between the petitioner and the complainant, thus, the <lb/>ingredients of section 420 are not satisfied. It is further submitted that there <lb/>is an inadvertent mistake of lifting of survey number from page 2 of the sale <lb/>deed, instead of taking it from the schedule is not intentional and the <lb/>documents were prepared by the property dealers, this inadvertent mistake <lb/>of wrong khasra number had no effect on the transactions. It is further <lb/>submitted that sale deed has been executed in favour of Jagjit Singh and <lb/>Harjit Singh after the receipt of consideration amount and the buyers as well <lb/>as the sellers were present before the court to confirm the transaction, <lb/>therefore, the allegations that the petitioner has cheated them is absolutely <lb/></body>

			<body>without any basis. It is also submitted that petitioner had already joined the <lb/>investigation on several occasions and has deep roots in the society. <lb/>5. <lb/>Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on following <lb/>judgments to bring home the point that arrest should be the last option and <lb/>should be restricted to exceptional cases as the maximum sentence for the <lb/>offence under section 420 is seven years :-<lb/>i. Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre vs State Of Maharashtra And <lb/>Ors, 2011 (1) SCC 694. <lb/>ii. Ravindra Saxena vs State Of Rajasthan, 2009 (1) SCC 684. <lb/>iii. Samrat Singh Nirula &amp; Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi, Bail <lb/>App No. 146/2015. <lb/>iv. Arnesh Kumar vs State Of Bihar &amp; Anr, 2014 (8) SCC 273. <lb/>6. <lb/>On the other hand, learned APP for the state and the counsel for the <lb/>complainant while vehemently opposing the present bail application <lb/>submitted that allegations against the petitioner are serious in nature. It is <lb/>further submitted that the petitioner has sold the same property to two <lb/>different buyers and that too when he is not the owner of the property in <lb/>question. It is further submitted that an amount of rupees 1.75 crores is <lb/>involved in cheating and this cheated amount was deposited in the account <lb/>of the present petitioner which is yet to be recovered and for this purpose the <lb/>custodial interrogation is required. It is further submitted that the petitioner <lb/>had deliberately concealed the material facts while selling the property in <lb/>question and entered into agreement to sell with the buyers claiming himself <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 2085/2021 <lb/>Page 6 of 7 <lb/>to be the owner. It is further submitted that the sister of the present petitioner <lb/>who is one of the legal heir has filed a suit in High Court of Delhi claiming <lb/>her share in the property, which shows that the petitioner is not the only <lb/>owner of the whole property. It is further submitted that the petitioner is <lb/>likely to misuse the liberty, if granted. It is further submitted that the <lb/>petitioner can hinder the investigation and may also threaten the witnesses. <lb/>7. <lb/>In the instant case, it is clear from the Status report filed by the state <lb/>that the petitioner had joined the investigation but not cooperated with the <lb/>investigating agency and there is nothing before this court to believe that the <lb/>accused is the only owner of the whole property in question but rather he <lb/>owns only 1/11 th share in the property. It is also pertinent to mention here <lb/>that the amount of rupees 1.75 crores is involved which is the alleged <lb/>cheated amount is yet to be recovered. Moreover, sister of the petitioner has <lb/>filed the suit before this court claiming her part of share who is stated to be <lb/>the other legal heir of the property in question. As far the contention of the <lb/>counsel for the petitioner that the khasra number have been wrongly <lb/>mentioned is concerned, the same will come into light during the course of <lb/>investigation. The allegations against the petitioner are grave and serious in <lb/>nature. Custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required in order to <lb/>recover cheated amount and to complete the investigation as petitioner is not <lb/>cooperating as stated. <lb/>8. <lb/>Therefore, in these circumstances, looking into the allegations and the <lb/>fact that the petitioner is not cooperating in the investigation, no ground for <lb/>BAIL APPLN. 2085/2021 <lb/>Page 7 of 7 <lb/>bail is made out, the bail application is, therefore, dismissed and stands <lb/>disposed of. Pending applications, if any, are also disposed of accordingly. <lb/>9. <lb/>Nothing stated hereinabove shall tantamount to the expression of any <lb/>opinion on the merits of the case. <lb/>RAJNISH BHATNAGAR, J <lb/>APRIL 27, 2022/p </body>
