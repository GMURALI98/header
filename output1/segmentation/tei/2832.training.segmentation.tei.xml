			<front>* <lb/>THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI <lb/>% <lb/>Judgment delivered on: 16.09.2011 <lb/>+ <lb/>WP(C) No.5438/2011 <lb/>BHUPEN ELECTRONICS LTD. <lb/>...... PETITIONER <lb/>Vs <lb/>APPELLATE AUTHORITY FOR INDUSTRIAL AND <lb/>FINANCIAL RECONSTRUCTION &amp; ORS. <lb/>.... RESPONDENTS <lb/>Advocates who appeared in this case: <lb/>For the Petitioner : <lb/>Ms.Pooja Verma <lb/>For the Respondent: <lb/>Mr. Sachin Datta and Ms. Gayatri Verma <lb/>CORAM :-<lb/>HON&apos;BLE MR JUSTICE SANJAY KISHAN KAUL <lb/>HON&apos;BLE MR JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER <lb/></front>

			<body>1. <lb/>Whether the Reporters of local papers may <lb/>be allowed to see the judgment ? <lb/>2. <lb/>To be referred to Reporters or not ? <lb/>Yes <lb/>3. <lb/>Whether the judgment should be reported <lb/>in the Digest ? <lb/>SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J (ORAL) <lb/>1. <lb/>The appellant <lb/>being aggrieved by an order dated <lb/>11.06.2009 passed by BIFR in reference case No.32/2007 <lb/>preferred appeal no.104/2010 before the AAIFR. This appeal was <lb/>not accompanied by any application for condonation of delay as <lb/>according to the appellant, the appeal had been filed within <lb/>time. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. <lb/>The appeal had been dismissed as time barred, not having <lb/>been filed within a period of 45 days, and not <lb/>being <lb/>accompanied by any application for condonation of delay by the <lb/>impugned order dated 18.11.2010 of the AAIFR. This order has <lb/>been passed at the initial stage itself in the absence of any <lb/>representation of the respondents. <lb/>3. <lb/>It is the say of the appellant <lb/>that the order dated <lb/>11.06.2009 of the BIFR was never received by the appellant <lb/>company and the appellant company derived knowledge from <lb/>one of the secured creditors, and therefore immediately <lb/>thereafter, they applied for certified copy on 22.02.2010 which <lb/>was received on 26.02.2010. <lb/>The appeal was filed on <lb/>08.04.2010. Thus, it is claimed that the appeal is filed within a <lb/>period of 45 days. <lb/>4. <lb/>The AAIFR took notice of the fact that the dispatch proof <lb/>received from BIFR showed that the order dated 11.06.2009 was <lb/>dispatched by the BIFR on 01.07.2009 by speed post at the <lb/>registered office of the appellant. The counsel for the appellant <lb/>was given time to check the records of the BIFR and the postal <lb/>authorities. It was found that the BIFR had not received back the <lb/>impugned order sent to the appellant with any unserved remark <lb/>or endorsement from the postal authorities. <lb/>No better <lb/></body>

			<body>information could be received from the postal authorities. The <lb/>appellant failed to rebut the presumption by not adducing any <lb/>information about the receipt of envelope which includes the <lb/>order dated 11.06.2009 since the same was not found returned <lb/>in the records of the BIFR. <lb/>5. <lb/>The appellant moved the application being: MJA No.9/11 <lb/>seeking recall of the impugned order dated 18.11.2010 of the <lb/>AAIFR, which had been dismissed on the ground that there is no <lb/>power of review and / or recall. The appellant had filed the <lb/>application after inspection of the records of the BIFR for dispatch <lb/>and incoming postal records for the relevant period and obtained <lb/>certified copies of the same which showed that the envelope <lb/>containing the order dated 11.06.2009 of the BIFR sent on <lb/>01.07.2009 was received back by the BIFR on 06.07.2009. <lb/>6. <lb/>The aforesaid two applications are now sought to be <lb/>impugned in the present writ petition filed under Article 226 of <lb/>the Constitution of India. <lb/>7. <lb/>In view of the facts averred, we considered it appropriate to <lb/>call upon the Bench Officer/Bench Registrar of the BIFR to <lb/>produce the record before us relating to service of the order <lb/>dated 11.06.2009 passed by the BIFR in case no.32/2007 <lb/>regarding service of the appellant. <lb/></body>

			<body>8. <lb/>The records seem to substantiate the plea of the petitioner <lb/>that the order dated 11.06.2009 sent to the petitioner on <lb/>01.07.2009 was apparently returned undelivered on 06.07.2009. <lb/>We called upon the Registrar of the BIFR to make inquiry on this <lb/>aspect and file an affidavit alongwith the copies of the relevant <lb/>portion of the receipt and dispatch register. It came to our <lb/>notice that the returned envelopes are not placed on the record <lb/>but sent to the record room with the result that it is not possible <lb/>to verify on inspection of records whether a particular envelope <lb/>has been returned back, and if so, the reason for the same. We <lb/>thus called upon the BIFR to also look into this aspect to <lb/>streamline the procedure. <lb/>9. <lb/>The Registrar of BIFR has filed an affidavit affirmed on <lb/>12.09.2011. The affidavit states that the envelope enclosing the <lb/>order dated 11.06.2009 was returned back undelivered by the <lb/>post office on 06.07.2009, and that the envelope was lying in the <lb/>record room. The concerned envelope was retrieved from the <lb/>record room and it was found that the same did not bear any <lb/>remark / endorsement of the postal authorities as to why the <lb/>letter was not delivered, and thus, the BIFR could not specify the <lb/>reason for non delivery. The affidavit also states that necessary <lb/>office orders have now been issued on 07.09.2011 and <lb/></body>

			<body>09.09.2011 in terms whereof undelivered envelopes would be <lb/>kept on record so that they can be inspected and a copy of the <lb/>order <lb/>passed <lb/>would <lb/>also <lb/>be <lb/>supplied <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>counsel/advocate/representative of the sick company as per <lb/>these two office orders respectively. Thus a better system has <lb/>been put in place. <lb/>10. The factual matrix referred to above, thus shows that the <lb/>order sought to be impugned by the appellant before the AAIFR <lb/>of the BIFR dated 11.06.2009 was never delivered to the <lb/>appellant nor the reason for non delivery is known. <lb/>The <lb/>appellant in the appeal in the AAIFR set forth the date from <lb/>which it derived knowledge from one of the secured creditors <lb/>and thereafter applied for certified copy, obtained the same and <lb/>filed the appeal within 45 days. Thus the appeal is filed within <lb/>time. <lb/>11. We thus set aside the impugned orders of the AAIFR dated <lb/>18.11.2010 and 29.06.2011 and direct that the appeal <lb/>no.104/2010 be heard by the AAIFR on merits. <lb/>12. We may also add that the AAIFR has fallen into an error <lb/>while passing order dated 29.06.2011 since the order passed on <lb/>18.11.2010 was on the basis of a factual error and without even <lb/>calling upon the BIFR to verify the position as regards the <lb/></body>

			<body>delivery of the envelope containing the order. The exercise <lb/>which we have undertaken could have been easily undertaken <lb/>by the AAIFR, possibly more conveniently. The relief sought for <lb/>by the appellant by filing MJA No.09/2011 was really not in the <lb/>nature of review but to correct an error which had come into <lb/>being while passing order dated 18.11.2010. AAIFR like any <lb/>other authority or Tribunal has incidental and/or ancillary powers <lb/>to correct such like errors. In this behalf, we may extract with <lb/>profit hereinbelow the relevant observations of the Supreme <lb/>Court in the case of ITO Vs. M.K. Mohd. Kunhi (1969) 71 ITR <lb/>815 :-<lb/>&quot;4. <lb/>There can be no manner of doubt that by the <lb/>provisions of the Act or the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal <lb/>Rules, 1963, powers have not been expressly conferred upon <lb/>the Appellate Tribunal to stay proceedings relating to the <lb/>recovery of penalty or tax due from an assessee. At the <lb/>same time it is significant that under section 220(6) the <lb/>power of stay by treating the assessee as not being in <lb/>default during the pendency of an appeal has been given to <lb/>the Income-tax Officer only when an appeal has been <lb/>presented under section 246 which will be to the Appellate <lb/>Assistant Commissioner and not to the Appellate Tribunal. <lb/>There is no provision in section 220 under which the Income-<lb/>tax Officer or any of his superior departmental officers can <lb/>be moved for granting stay in the recovery of penalty or tax. <lb/>It may be that section 225, notwithstanding that a certificate <lb/>has been issued to the Tax Recovery Officer for the recovery <lb/>of any tax (the position will be the same with regard to <lb/>penalty) the Income-tax Officer may grant time for the <lb/>payment of the tax. In this manner he can probably keep on <lb/>granting extensions until the disposal of the appeal by <lb/></body>

			<body>the Tribunal. It may also be that as a matter of practice <lb/>prevailing in the department the Commissioner or the <lb/>Inspecting <lb/>Assistant <lb/>Commissioner <lb/>in <lb/>exercise <lb/>of <lb/>administrative powers can give the necessary relief of <lb/>staying recovery to the assessee but that can hardly be put <lb/>at par with a statutory power as is contained in <lb/>s.220(6)which is confined only to the stage of pendency of an <lb/>appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. <lb/>The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant before us <lb/>that in the absence of any express provisions in Sections 254 <lb/>and 255 of the Act relating to stay of recovery during the <lb/>pendency of an appeal it must be held that no such power <lb/>can be exercised by the Tribunal, suffers from a fundamental <lb/>infirmity inasmuch as it assumes and proceeds on the <lb/>premise that the statute confers such a power on the <lb/>Income-tax Officer who can give the necessary relief to an <lb/>assessee. The right of appeal is a substantive right and the <lb/>questions of fact and law are at large and are open to review <lb/>by the Appellate Tribunal. Indeed the Tribunal has been <lb/>given very wide powers under s. 254(1) for it may pass such <lb/>orders as it thinks fit after giving full hearing to both the <lb/>parties to the appeal. If the Income-tax Officer and the <lb/>Appellate Assistant Commissioner have made assessments <lb/>or imposed penalties raising very large demands and if the <lb/>Appellate Tribunal is entirely helpless in the matter of stay or <lb/>recovery the entire purpose of the appeal can be defeated if <lb/>ultimately the orders of the departmental authorities are set <lb/>aside. It is difficult to conceive that the Legislature should <lb/>have left the entire matter to the administrative authorities <lb/>to make such orders as they choose to pass in exercise of <lb/>unfettered discretion. The assessee, as has been pointed out <lb/>before, has no right to even move an application when an <lb/>appeal is pending before the Appellate Tribunal under <lb/>s.220(6) and it is only at the earlier stage of appeal before <lb/>the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the statute <lb/>provides for such a matter being dealt with by the Income-<lb/>tax Officer. It is a firmly established rule that an express <lb/>grant of statutory power carries with it by necessary <lb/>implication the authority to use all reasonable means to <lb/>make <lb/>such <lb/>grant <lb/>effective <lb/>(Sutherland <lb/>Statutory <lb/>Construction, Third Edition, Arts. 5401 and 5402). The <lb/>powers which have been conferred by s.254 on the Appellate <lb/>Tribunal with widest possible amplitude must carry with them <lb/>by necessary implication all powers and duties incidental and <lb/>necessary to make the exercise of those powers fully <lb/></body>

			<body>effective. In Domat&apos;s Civil Law Cushing&apos;s Edition, Vol. 1 at <lb/>page 88, it has been stated : <lb/>&quot;It is the duty of the judges to apply the laws, not <lb/>only to what appears to be regulated by their <lb/>express dispositions, but to all the cases where a <lb/>just application of them may be made, and which <lb/>appear to be comprehended either within the <lb/>consequences that may be gathered from it.&quot; <lb/>Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, eleventh edition, <lb/>contains a statement at page 350 that &quot;where an Act confers <lb/>a jurisdiction, it impliedly also grants the power of doing all <lb/>such acts, or employing such means, as are essentially <lb/>necessary to its execution. Cui jurisdictio data est, ea quoqe <lb/>concessa esse videntur, sine quibus jurisdictio explicari non <lb/>potuit.&quot; An instance is given based on Ex parte Martin [1879] <lb/>4. Q.B.D. 212 that &quot;where an inferior court is empowered to <lb/>grant an injunction, the power of punishing disobedience to it <lb/>by commitment is impliedly conveyed by the enactment, for <lb/>the power would be useless if it could not be enforced.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is ours) <lb/>12.1 This view has been reiterated in Union of India Vs. Paras <lb/>Laminates (P) Ltd., (1990) 4 SCC 453. The relevant portion <lb/>is extracted hereinbelow :-<lb/>&quot;8. There is no doubt that the Tribunal functions as a <lb/>court within the limits of its jurisdiction. It has all the <lb/>powers conferred expressly by the statute. Furthermore, <lb/>being a judicial body, it has all those incidental and <lb/>ancillary powers which are necessary to make fully <lb/>effective the express grant of statutory powers. Certain <lb/>powers are recognised as incidental and ancillary, not <lb/>because they are inherent in the Tribunal, nor because <lb/>its jurisdiction is plenary, but because it is the legislative <lb/>intent that the power which is expressly granted in the <lb/>assigned field of jurisdiction is efficaciously and <lb/>meaningfully exercised, the powers of the Tribunal are <lb/>no doubt limited. Its area of jurisdiction is clearly <lb/>defined, but within the bounds of its jurisdiction, it has <lb/>all the powers expressly and impliedly granted. The <lb/></body>

			<body>implied grant is, of course, limited by the express grant <lb/>and, therefore, it can only be such powers as are truly <lb/>incidental and ancillary for doing all such acts or <lb/>employing all such means as are reasonably necessary <lb/>to make the grant effective. As stated in Maxwell on <lb/>Interpretation of Statutes, (eleventh edition) &quot;where an <lb/>Act confers a jurisdiction, it impliedly also grants the <lb/>power of doing all such acts, or employing such means, <lb/>as are essentially necessary to its execution&quot;.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is ours) <lb/>13. The writ petition is allowed leaving the parties to bear their <lb/>own costs. <lb/>The petitioner to appear before the AAIFR on 10.10.2011. <lb/>SANJAY KISHAN KAUL,J <lb/>RAJIV SHAKDHER, J <lb/>SEPTEMBER 16, 2011 <lb/>yg </body>
