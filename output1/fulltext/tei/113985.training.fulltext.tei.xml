			<p>4.<lb/> MANISH KAPOOR SON OF SHRI ROSHAN LAL<lb/> R/O VILLAGE SAYAND, POST OFFICE LOHARA<lb/> DISTRICT MANDI, HIMACHAL PRADESH.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> SANDEEP KUMAR SON OF SHRI BHAG SINGH<lb/> RESIDENT OF VILLAGE BUDDU, POST OFFICE &amp; TEHSIL<lb/> GHUMARWIN, DISTRICT BILASPUR, HIMACHAL PRADESH.<lb/> All these petitions are being decided together by a common judgment as<lb/> identical questions of fact and law are involved.<lb/> The questions, posed for determination herein, have arisen from<lb/> happening of events which have sequentially continued for inordinate period of<lb/> more than six years.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> Government of Himachal Pradesh had created posts of Junior Office<lb/> Assistant (Information and Technology), Class-III, Non-Gazetted [for short,<lb/> &quot;JOA (IT&quot;)] for recruitment in its various Administrative Departments. Common<lb/> Recruitment and Promotion Rules (for short, &quot;2014 Rules&quot;) for the post JOA (IT)<lb/> were notified on 24 th December, 2014. The minimum educational and other<lb/> qualifications for the direct recruitment were prescribed as under: -<lb/></p>

			<p>(a)<lb/> ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATION:-<lb/></p>

			<item>(i)<lb/> 10+2 from a recognized Board of School Education/University.<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii)<lb/> One year Diploma in Computer Science/Computer Application/<lb/> Information<lb/></item>

			<item>Technology<lb/> from<lb/> a<lb/> recognized<lb/> University/Institution.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii)<lb/> Computer typing speed of 30 words per minute in English or 25<lb/> words per minute in Hindi.<lb/></item>

			<item>OR<lb/></item>

 (i)<lb/> 10+2 from a recognized Board of School Education/University.<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii)<lb/> &apos;O&apos; or &apos;A&apos; level Diploma from National Institute of Electronics &amp;<lb/> Information Technology (NIELIT).<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii)<lb/> Computer typing speed of 30 words per minute in English or 25<lb/> words per minute in Hindi.<lb/></item>

			<item>(b)<lb/> DESIRABLE QUALIFICATION(S).-Knowledge of customs,<lb/> manner and dialects of Himachal Pradesh and suitability for<lb/> appointment in the peculiar conditions prevailing in the Pradesh.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>3.<lb/> The Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission (for short<lb/> &quot;HPSSC&quot;) vide Advertisement No. 30/2015 dated 13.02.2015 invited<lb/> applications from the eligible candidates for appointment to 1421 posts of<lb/> JOA(IT). Though the prescribed minimum essential qualifications were<lb/> as per R&amp;P Rules, still, besides the candidates having qualifications as per<lb/> advertisement, a large number of candidates falling under one of the<lb/> following categories were also provisionally admitted by HPSSC:<lb/></item>

			<item>(i)<lb/> Those who either held qualification higher to the prescribed<lb/> qualifications;<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii)<lb/> those who were having prescribed qualifications but from<lb/> institutes which were not considered as recognized;<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) those who held qualification equivalent to the prescribed<lb/> qualification.<lb/></item>

			<item>This anomalous situation was result of the prevalent procedure<lb/> which required applications to be submitted online without supporting<lb/> documents merely on the basis of declaration of candidate made in the<lb/> online recruitment applications. However, there was clear stipulation in<lb/> the advertisement that the candidates must ensure their eligibility in<lb/> respect of category, experience, age and essential qualification(s) etc. as<lb/> per requirement of the post advertised to avoid rejection at later stage.<lb/></item>

			<item>4.<lb/> Having received the applications from large number of candidates<lb/> whose educational qualifications were not strictly in accordance with the<lb/> prescription made either in the 2014 Rules or the advertisement, HPSSC<lb/> started to seek clarification from the State Government since as far back<lb/> as 4.11.2015, when for the first time HPSSC sought clarification from<lb/> State Government by posing questions as under:<lb/></item>

			<item>&quot;1. Whether a certificate or diploma issued by any registered institute<lb/> operating within the state of H.P. or from outside the state is valid<lb/> for determining eligibility for recruitment to the post of Junior<lb/> Office Assistant (IT) or such certificates issued by recognized<lb/> institutes are to be accepted.<lb/></item>

			<item>2. A list of registered/recognized institutes whose diplomas/certificates<lb/> are valid/recognized for determining eligibility for the post.<lb/></item>

			<item>3. Any other clarification/guidelines as deemed fit in respect of the<lb/> recruitment to the post.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The process seeking clarification continued thereafter as is evident<lb/> from series of correspondence dated 25.02.2016, 27.12.2016, 29.5.2017,<lb/> 3.6.2017, 24.6. 2017 and 14.7.2017 available on record of CWPOA 34 of<lb/> 2019 (Pawan Kumar and others Vs State of H.P and others).<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> In absence of any decision from the State Government, HPSSC<lb/> continued with selection process. A written objective type test was held on<lb/> 10.04.2016. Total 12473 candidates qualified the test and were called to<lb/> undertake Skilled Typing Test. 10271 candidates appeared for the Skilled<lb/> Typing Test and 4092 candidates qualified and were called for interviews<lb/> which were scheduled from 13.05.2017 to 12.07.2017. Candidature of all<lb/> candidates, except those who were found to be holding qualification<lb/> strictly as per 2014 Rules, were rejected. Faced with the situation, some of<lb/> persons with rejected candidature approached the then State<lb/> Administrative Tribunal (for short, &quot;Tribunal&quot;) against their rejection by<lb/> way of OA Nos. 2830, 2989, 2994, 2998, 3009 and 3026 of 2017 and an<lb/> order dated 30.6.2017 came to be passed by the Tribunal in following<lb/> terms:<lb/></p>

			<item>Heard.<lb/> Notice in all the original applications except O.A. No.2994<lb/> of 2017, which is accepted by Ms. Archna Dutt in O.A. Nos.2830<lb/> and 3026 of 2017 and Mr. Raj Kumar Negi in O.A. Nos.2989,<lb/> 2998 and 3009 of 2017, learned Standing Counsel, respectively.<lb/></item>

			<item>2.<lb/> All these matters being inter-connected, shall stand<lb/> clubbed together.<lb/></item>

No.2994 of 2017, Bhavnesh Kumar and others Versus<lb/> Himachal Pradesh Staff Selection Commission, the learned<lb/> Standing Counsel for the respondent-Commission has filed<lb/> instructions dated<lb/> 29 th June, 2017, which are taken on<lb/> record.<lb/></item>

			<item>7.<lb/> Heard the learned counsel for the parties on the prayer on<lb/> behalf of the applicant(s) for interim relief.<lb/></item>

However, prima facie, it is<lb/> made out that they are holding one year diploma in Computer. In<lb/> such circumstances, there shall be a direction in the interim to the<lb/> respondent-Commission to permit the applicant(s), who admittedly<lb/> have already appeared in the written/typing test, to appear in the<lb/> interview, provisionally. However, their result shall not be<lb/> declared and instead kept in a sealed cover till the matter with<lb/> regard to equivalence of the diploma held by them with the<lb/> diploma required as per the aforesaid educational qualifications is<lb/> considered and decided by the newly added respondent No.2-State,<lb/> which shall be done as expeditiously as possible, but within a<lb/> reasonable timeframe.<lb/></item>

			<p>2253, 2289, 2290, 2388, 2394 and 7681 of 2020 in this Court after<lb/> abolition of the Tribunal.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> On 21.8.2017, the State Government directed HPSSC to go ahead<lb/> with the recruitment process in terms of decision taken by the equivalence<lb/> committee formed for the purpose. The communication dated 21.08.2017<lb/> reads as under: -<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;I am directed to refer to your letter No. HPSSC 8(2)-862/15-<lb/>13161 dated 14th July, 2017 and also the other references seeking<lb/> clarification on the subject cited above and to say that the matter has<lb/> been considered at the Government Level in compliance of the directions<lb/> passed by the Hon&apos;ble Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal in OA<lb/> No. 2994 of 2017 and other various similar OA&apos;s pending adjudication<lb/> before the Hon&apos;ble, Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal that the<lb/> applicant(s) be permitted to appear in the interview, provisionally and<lb/> their result should be kept in sealed cover till the matter with regard to<lb/> equivalence of the diploma held by them with the diploma required as per<lb/> prescribed educational qualification in rules is considered and decided by<lb/> the State. While passing these orders the Hon&apos;ble Himachal Pradesh<lb/> candidates are holding one year diploma in Computer though<lb/> nomenclature of the one year diploma held by them in Computer is not in<lb/> consonance with the nomenclature as prescribed. The Government after<lb/> having detailed examination and convening a meeting of all concerned<lb/> departments has arrived at the following decisions:<lb/></item>

			<item>(1). All such candidates having one year Diploma in Computer or<lb/> higher qualification in Computer Science/Application/IT from any<lb/> private Institution like from. Society under Societies Act. Rashtrya<lb/> Saksharta Mission IT programme/Skill Development Programme<lb/> etc. be considered for final selection subject to having successfully<lb/> passed their skill test i.e. Typing Test on Computer and after<lb/> having obtained their undertaking/declaration certifying that they<lb/> had attended the classes/diploma course by attending the classes<lb/> regularly.<lb/></item>

			<item>(2). That the Computer Science is not limited to the specific<lb/> nomenclature of Diploma prescribed in the R&amp;P Rules, as such,<lb/> the Diplomas in Computer and other Higher Qualifications<lb/> belonging to Computer Science/application Irrespective of their<lb/> nomenclature be also considered for final selection subject to<lb/> having successfully passed their skill test i.e. Typing Test on<lb/> Computer and alter having their undertaking/declaration certifying<lb/> that they had attended the classes/diploma course by attending the<lb/> classes regularly. There may be instance where certificates are<lb/> issued instead of diploma, In: such cases, the Commission is to<lb/> ascertain and ensure that subjects stadled, are at par with one year<lb/> Diploma course in Computer Science/Application/IT.<lb/></item>

			<item>(3). The date of personal interview of the candidate concerned in<lb/> the instant case be treated as valid date for evaluation/<lb/> consideration/acceptance<lb/> of<lb/> his/her<lb/> diploma/<lb/> essential<lb/> qualification.<lb/></item>

			<item>(4). With regard to educational qualification, as informed during<lb/> the meeting, the Commission has sought clarification of<lb/> equivalence in some cases from the concerned authorities,<lb/> therefore, the Commission need to proceed further in accordance<lb/> with the clarification/decision obtained from the State Level Board<lb/> of Equivalence Committee/H.P. Board of School Education by<lb/> accepting the qualification of such candidate(s) for this job if that<lb/> is found equivalent to 10+2 and valid for pursuing higher studies.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The decision so taken and conveyed was subsequently approved by<lb/> the State Cabinet on 18.09.2017.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> In pursuance to the above noticed decision of the Government,<lb/> HPSSC reviewed the selection process and allowed those candidates to be<lb/> considered for selection, who had earlier been rejected. Appointments<lb/> were accordingly offered and made. Consequently, many candidates<lb/> though eligible as per R&amp;P Rules, could not find place in the merit of<lb/> selected candidates. This triggered another round of litigation. Some of<lb/> these candidates approached the Tribunal by way of OA No. 5543 of 2017<lb/> which later came to be registered as CWPOA 34 of 2019 in this Court and<lb/> is also being decided herein. Since this Original Application was filed<lb/> after declaration of final select list of HPSSC and all the selected persons<lb/> were impleaded as private respondents with the aid of order 1 Rule 8 of<lb/> the Code of Civil Procedure.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> Thus, following two sets of litigations arose out of selection<lb/> process undertaken by HPSSC for posts of JOA (IT) under Post Code 447<lb/> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;JOA 447&quot;)<lb/></p>

			<p>(i)<lb/> OA Nos. 2830, 2989, 2994, 2998, 3009 and 3026 of 2017<lb/> (later registered as CWPOA Nos. 2253, 2289,2290,2388,2394 and<lb/> 7681 of 2020 in this Court after abolition of the Tribunal) by<lb/> candidates whose candidature for JOA 447 was rejected by HPSSC<lb/> for not possessing qualification as per R&amp;P Rules.<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii)<lb/> OA No. 5543 of 2017 (later registered as CWPOA 34 of<lb/> 2019 in this Court) by candidates who failed to find their names in<lb/> select list as a consequence of decision dated 21.8.2017<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> The above-mentioned litigation gave rise to the issue, Whether<lb/> the decision dated 21.8.2017/18.9.2017 of State Government qualified<lb/> the test of legality and fairness, if so, whether the selections made by<lb/> HPSSC to JOA 447, in pursuance to such decision, were valid?<lb/></p>

			<p>10.<lb/> For adjudication of above question, in the first instance, we<lb/> propose to consider the challenge raised by petitioners in CWPOA No. 34<lb/> of 2019 which has been filed for following reliefs:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;i. That Annexure A-2 clarification dated 21 st of<lb/> August 2017 issued by respondent number 1 may be<lb/> quashed and set aside. Further Annexure A-3 office<lb/> order dated 8 of September 2017 may also be<lb/> quashed and set aside.<lb/></item>

			<item>ii. That the respondent number 2 may be directed to<lb/> prepare merit list of candidates possessing essential<lb/> and minimum qualification mention in the<lb/> advertisement No.3/2015 dated 13.2.2015 and<lb/> recommend their names for recruitment.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>11.<lb/> Petitioners in CWPOA 34 of 2019 have raised following grounds<lb/> for seeking the reliefs as noticed above:<lb/></p>

			<item>a) Respondents could not have prescribed additional<lb/> mode of selection.<lb/></item>

			<item>b) There was no power to relax the R&amp;P Rules vis-a-vis<lb/> essential qualification.<lb/> c) The entire exercise was done with oblique motive to<lb/> allow the ineligible candidates.<lb/></item>

			<item>d) It nullified the effect of R&amp;P Rules.<lb/> e) Those persons also became eligible who had acquired<lb/> minimum qualifications on dates subsequent to the last<lb/> date of submission of applications.<lb/> f) The changes in R&amp;P Rules could be made only by due<lb/> process of law.<lb/></item>

			<p>12. The genesis of dispute can be traced from the following expression<lb/> used in 2014 Rules:-<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">&quot;One year Diploma in Computer Science/Computer Application/<lb/> Information<lb/> Technology<lb/> from<lb/> a<lb/> recognized<lb/> University/Institution&quot;.<lb/> Firstly</figure>

			<p>, there appeared to be a confusion with respect to import of<lb/> expression &quot;recognized University/Institution&quot; and secondly, in respect<lb/> of diploma qualification having been held by the candidates under<lb/> different nomenclatures. The dispute arose when many candidates<lb/> applied for JOA 447 claiming to have Diploma in the same subjects as<lb/> prescribed in 2014 Rules but with different nomenclature and the other<lb/> dispute was raised in respect of authority which was to recognize the<lb/> institutes issuing requisite Diploma. Another area of discord was created<lb/> by the candidates having higher qualification. As evident from the said<lb/> clause of 2014 Rules, no specific nomenclature of required diploma was<lb/> prescribed. It was mentioned only as diploma in computer<lb/> science/computer application/information technology, whereas more than<lb/> one type of curriculum could be said to have satisfied the requirement in<lb/> this behalf. As regards recognized university is concerned, there could not<lb/> be any dispute regarding the authority having jurisdiction to recognize the<lb/> university, but it was totally unclear as to which was the authority whose<lb/> recognition was valid vis-a-vis the institution prescribed by 2014 Rules.<lb/></p>

			<p>13.<lb/> Before adverting to the merits of ground or objections raised in<lb/> CWPOA No.34 of 2019, it is relevant to notice that Original Application<lb/> was filed before the Tribunal after the process of appointments to the post<lb/> of JOA (IT) (post code-447) was completed by respondents. Noticeably,<lb/> neither the selection process undertaken by HPSSC for JOA 447 nor the<lb/> selections made thereby are under challenge. It is also to be noticed that<lb/> the decision of the State Government dated 21.08.2017 to allow candidates<lb/> for selection other than the candidates having qualification strictly as per<lb/> the R&amp;P Rules was ratified and confirmed by an ex-post facto sanction<lb/> granted by the State Cabinet on 18 th September, 2017 and such decision of<lb/> the Government has also not been assailed. Simply, the prayer made in the<lb/> original application seeking directions to HPSSC to prepare merit list of<lb/> candidates possessing essential and minimum qualification mentioned in<lb/> the advertisement No.3/2015 dated 13.02.2015 may not suffice in the<lb/> absence of the reliefs as noticed above<lb/> 14.<lb/> In the aforesaid backdrop, we now proceed to consider the<lb/> objections raised by petitioners in CWPOA 34 of 2019. A challenge has<lb/> been laid to the competence and power of the State Government to relax<lb/> R&amp;P Rules and also to prescribe additional mode of selection. It has been<lb/> contended that change in R&amp;P Rules could not be made by administrative<lb/> instructions without adoption of due process as envisaged under law. The<lb/> contention so raised by the petitioners deserves rejection, for the reasons<lb/> that firstly the 2014 Rules, vide Clause 18 reserves power of relaxation in<lb/> favour of State Government. The relevant Clause reads as under: -<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;18. Power to relax.-Where the State Govt. is of the opinion<lb/> that it is necessary or expedient to do so, it may, by order for<lb/> reasons to be recorded in writing and in consultation with the<lb/> Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission, relax any of<lb/> the provision(s) of these rules with respect to any class or<lb/> category of person(s) of post(s).<lb/></item>

			<p>By virtue of decision dated 21.08.2017 confirmed by State Cabinet on<lb/> 18.09.2017, it was decided that the category of persons sought to be<lb/> selected required elaboration. This power to relax is vested in the State<lb/> Government, in case State Government finds it necessary or expedient to<lb/> do so. The only prescription that appears to have been lacking in the<lb/> instant case is that the Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission was<lb/> not consulted before the aforesaid decision. The right of consultation with<lb/> Public Service Commission is prescribed by Article 320(3) of the<lb/> Constitution, however, the Proviso to Article 320 empower the Governor<lb/> of State to make Regulations specifying matters exempted from prior<lb/> consultation process of the Public Service Commission. In exercise of such<lb/> powers &quot;The Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission (Exemption<lb/> from consultation) Regulations, 1973&quot; have been framed. As per<lb/> Regulation 3 thereof the exemption from consultation extends to services<lb/> and posts specified in Schedule to such Regulations and clause 8(i) of the<lb/> Schedule relates to selection and recommendation for making recruitment<lb/> to Class III posts, excepting certain categories which in any case does not<lb/> include the post of JOA(IT). Thus the relaxation of 2014 Rules undertaken<lb/> by the State Government was within its competence and powers.<lb/></p>

			<p>15.<lb/> Secondly, it is evident from the facts detailed hereinabove that the<lb/> prescriptions of requisite qualification be it in 2014 Rules or in the<lb/> advertisement could not be said to be unambiguous. The subjects of<lb/> Computer Science or Information Technology cannot be restricted only to<lb/> the nomenclature used in R&amp;P Rules/advertisement. Both these subjects<lb/> carry within them more than one type of curriculum. Thus, in the absence<lb/> of any clarity as to the kind of curriculum required as pre-condition for<lb/> eligibility, the decision of the State Government dated 21.08.2017 read<lb/> with cabinet decision dated 18.09.2017 cannot be faulted. In addition,<lb/> there was also no clarity as to the authority whose recognition was valid,<lb/> vis-a-vis, the institutions competent to award requisite Diploma. The<lb/> repeated correspondence inter-se the HPSSC and the State Government is<lb/> evidences this fact. Further, the material discussed by the equivalence<lb/> committee appointed by the State Government also warrants the same<lb/> conclusion. Support can be drawn from the fact that common R&amp;P Rules<lb/> for the post of JOA (IT) have been amended by the State Government in<lb/> 2020 (for short, &quot;2020 Rules&quot;), the relevant extract thereof reads as under:<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">&quot;(a) ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATION(S):<lb/> (i) Should have passed 10+2 from a recognized<lb/> Board of School Education/University.<lb/> OR<lb/> Matriculation from recognized Board of School<lb/> Education<lb/> with<lb/> one/two<lb/> year&apos;s<lb/> Diploma/Certificate from an Industrial Training<lb/> Institute (ITI) in Information Technology<lb/> Enabled Sectors (ITES) as notified by Director<lb/> General of Employment &amp; Training (Govt. of<lb/> India) from time to time or three years Diploma<lb/> in Computer Engineering/Computer Science/IT<lb/> from Polytechnic as approved by All India<lb/> Council for Technical Education (AICTE);&quot;<lb/></figure>

			<p>Record reveals that one of the considerations for amendment of these<lb/> Rules was the imprecise provision as to the exact kind of diploma required<lb/> and also the authority which was empowered to authorise the institutions<lb/> to award the requisite diploma. The 2020 Rules now appears to have<lb/> clearly prescribed the institutes whose diploma will be valid as also the<lb/> nomenclature of the diploma as will be relevant for considering the<lb/> selection and appointment to the post of JOA (IT).<lb/></p>

			<p>16.<lb/> Thirdly, it cannot be ignored that multifarious litigations had<lb/> erupted as a result of the ambiguous 2014 Rules and the posts of JOA (IT)<lb/> involved therein were required to be filled on urgent basis. The number of<lb/> posts advertised as well as their usefulness in almost all the departments of<lb/> the Government underlined the importance and urgency involved.<lb/> Apparently, Class-III, Non-Gazetted posts of JOA (IT) became necessity<lb/> in all the departments as a result of advent of computerization and<lb/> information technology. In order to cope with the requirements of<lb/> personnel having basic knowledge in computer, these posts were created.<lb/> The records further reveal that even after the selection process undertaken<lb/> for JOA 447, hundreds of more posts of JOA (IT) came to be advertised<lb/> later through advertisement for post codes 556 and 817.<lb/></p>

			<p>17.<lb/> Fourthly, the exercise to constitute equivalence committee was<lb/> under taken in pursuance to the judicial order passed by the Tribunal on<lb/> 30.6.2017. This order was never assailed by anyone including the<lb/> petitioners in the instant petition. This being so, the deviation made by the<lb/> State Government from R&amp;P Rules in the aforesaid manner cannot be<lb/> faulted.<lb/></p>

			<p>18.<lb/> Last but not the least, there is nothing on record from which it can<lb/> be inferred that the impugned action of the State Government/HPSSC had<lb/> some extraneous motive or was not bonafide. The contention of the<lb/> petitioners that the entire exercise of respondents was with oblique motive<lb/> to allow ineligible candidate is to be ignored without any tangible material<lb/> on record in support or substantiation thereto.<lb/></p>

			<p>19.<lb/> The contention raised by the petitioners that by the aforesaid action<lb/> of the respondents, those persons also became eligible who had acquired<lb/> the eligibility after the cutoff date prescribed in the advertisement is also<lb/> required to be rejected for the reason that the petitioners have miserably<lb/> failed to provide details in respect of such category of persons. In absence<lb/> of such details no relief can be granted to the petitioners particularly in the<lb/> view of the nature of dispute that involves more than one categories of<lb/> candidates. The contention of petitioners, if was to be upheld, would have<lb/> required such category of persons to be identified separately. Even<lb/> otherwise there is no trite law that the employer cannot change the<lb/> prescription during continuation of selection process. This can be said with<lb/> more certainty in the given facts and circumstances of the case where there<lb/> was urgency and the time taken to amend ambiguous Rules would have<lb/> caused prejudice to the employer.<lb/> recruitment/selection process cannot be made subject matter of judicial<lb/> review merely on the ground that the employer has changed/ amended the<lb/> rule(s) after initiation of the process. Reference in this regard can be<lb/> placed on judgment passed by Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Maharashtra<lb/> Public Service Commission Through Its Secretary; Ashok Tukaram<lb/> Barde Vs. Sandeep Shriram Warade and Others; Suhas Sudhakarrao<lb/> Lavhekar and Others Etc. Etc., (2019) 6 SCC 362, wherein it has held<lb/> as under:<lb/> [9] The essential qualifications for appointment to a post are for<lb/> the employer to decide. The employer may prescribe additional or<lb/> desirable qualifications, including any grant of preference. It is the<lb/> employer who is best suited to decide the requirements a candidate<lb/> must possess according to the needs of the employer and the nature<lb/> of work. The court cannot lay down the conditions of eligibility,<lb/> much less can it delve into the issue with regard to desirable<lb/> qualifications being at par with the essential eligibility by an<lb/> interpretive re-writing of the advertisement. Questions of<lb/> equivalence will also fall outside the domain of judicial review. If<lb/> the language of the advertisement and the rules are clear, the Court<lb/> cannot sit in judgment over the same. If there is an ambiguity in<lb/> the advertisement or it is contrary to any rules or law the matter<lb/> has to go back to the appointing authority after appropriate orders,<lb/> to proceed in accordance with law. In no case can the Court, in the<lb/> garb of judicial review, sit in the chair of the appointing authority<lb/> to decide what is best for the employer and interpret the conditions<lb/> of the advertisement contrary to the plain language of the same.<lb/> To similar effect is exposition made by Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in State<lb/> of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Raghuveer Singh Yadav, (1994) 6 SCC 151,<lb/> which reads as under:<lb/> [5] It is not in dispute that Statutory Rules have been made<lb/> introducing Degree in Science or Engineering or Diploma in<lb/> Technology as qualifications for recruitment to the posts of<lb/> Inspector of Weights and Measures. It is settled law that the State<lb/> has got power to prescribe qualifications for recruitment. Here is a<lb/> case that pursuant to amended Rules, the government has<lb/> withdrawn the earlier notification and wants to proceed with the<lb/> recruitment afresh. It is not a case of any accrued right. The<lb/> candidates who had appeared for the examination and passed the<lb/> written examination had only legitimate expectation to be<lb/> considered of their claims according to the rules then in vogue. The<lb/> amended Rules have only prospective operation. The government<lb/> is entitled to conduct selection in accordance with the changed<lb/> rules and make final recruitment. Obviously, no candidate acquired<lb/> any vested right against the State. Therefore, the State is entitled to<lb/> withdraw the notification by which it had previously notified<lb/> recruitment and to issue fresh notification in that regard on the<lb/> basis of the amended Rules.<lb/></p>

			<p>21.<lb/> Thus, the contentions raised by petitioners in CWPOA No. 34 of<lb/> 2019 are rejected and the process of selection and appointment already<lb/> concluded by the respondents against Post Code 447 is upheld. In view of<lb/> the declaration of selection process for Post Code 447 as legal and valid,<lb/> the petitions i.e. CWPOA No. 2253, 2289, 2290, 2388, 2394 and 7681 of<lb/> 2020 have been rendered infructuous as the relief sought in all such<lb/> petitions was to allow the persons other than those having qualifications<lb/> strictly as per R &amp; P Rules/advertisement in the selection process.<lb/></p>

			<p>22.<lb/> While the selection process for JOA 447 was still experiencing the<lb/> turmoil of rival claims, as detailed above, HPSSC, undertook yet another<lb/> process for selection of 1156 posts of JOA (IT) in pursuance to<lb/> advertisement No. 32-3/2016 dated 18.10.2016 (post code 556)<lb/> (hereinafter referred to as JOA 556) for brevity, out of which 85 posts<lb/> were to be filled on regular basis in Excise Department and the rest were<lb/> to be filled on contract basis. The Essential Minimum Qualification this<lb/> time also remained as per prescription of 2014 Rules. Again, the online<lb/> applications were submitted by all categories of candidates, as in the case<lb/> of JOA 447, and the already existing confusion aggravated. As noticed<lb/> above, the selection process for JOA 447 stood completed in September,<lb/> 2017 from perspective of respondents, notwithstanding, pending litigation<lb/> for rival claims. Faced again with dilemma, HPSSC once again sought<lb/> clarification from the State Government regarding criteria to be adopted<lb/> for selection process against post code 556. In response, the State<lb/> Government vide letter dated 19.03.2018 directed HPSSC to implement<lb/> the clarification earlier issued vide communication dated 21.8.2017 in the<lb/> on-going process against post code 556 also. Contents of letter dated<lb/> 19.3.2018 read as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;I am directed to refer to your letters No. HPSSC-C92)970/16 dated<lb/> 01.01.2018 &amp; 16-02-2018 on the subject cited above and to say that since the<lb/> posts of Junior Office Assistant (IT), Class-III (Non-Gazetted) have been<lb/> advertised under different post codes i.e. Post Code 447 and 556 but are to be<lb/> filled up under one set of common Recruitment and Promotion Rules for the<lb/> post and as such carry one or similar cadre. It has been decided that the<lb/> clarification dated 21-08-2017, issue by this department on the directions of<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal in respect of post code<lb/> 447, be also implemented in the on going process under post code 556, being<lb/> recruitment for the same post with similar provisions of rules. However, the<lb/> clarification/instructions dated 21-08-2017 are under challenge before the<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Court, as such, its implementation will be subject to final outcome of<lb/> Hon&apos;ble Court orders so passed in case of post code 447 in the pending<lb/> matters.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>23.<lb/> The aforesaid decision of State Government prepared another<lb/> battle grounds for rival claimants. CWPOA No. 7585 of 2019 titled<lb/> Akshay Sharma Vs State of H.P. and others is one such petition which has<lb/> been filed by the candidate claiming right of selection strictly as per 2014<lb/> Rules. Whereas, petitions filed by candidates seeking benefit of decision<lb/> taken by the State Government on 21.8.2017 for JOA 447 and made<lb/> applicable to JOA 556 vide communication dated 19.3.</p>

			<p>24.<lb/> Despite communication dated 19.3.2918 from State Government<lb/> to the HPSSC, the selections for JOA 556 were ultimately made strictly in<lb/> accordance with 2014 Rules. Noticeable, a sequence of events took place<lb/> after publication of JOA 556 Advertisement which ostensibly made the<lb/> HPSSC to ignore directions of Government. A glance at such events shall<lb/> be material to understand the background.<lb/></p>

			<p>24.1. An Original Application No. 2644 of 2018 (CWPOA 7585 of<lb/> 2019) titled Akshay Sharma Vs State of Himachal Pradesh and others was<lb/> preferred before the Tribunal laying challenge to the communication dated<lb/> 9.3.2018 of the State Government. On 16.8.2018 the Tribunal passed<lb/> interim order in OA 2644 of 2018 in following terms:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;In the facts and circumstances, materials on record and interest of<lb/> justice, subject to keeping fifteen posts of Junior Office Assistant<lb/> vacant post for the applicants and final outcome of the original<lb/> applications, respondent No.3-Commission shall be free to declare<lb/> the result of the process for recruitment to the post of Junior Office<lb/> Assistants.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The order dated 16.8.2018 was assailed before this Court in CWP<lb/> 1964/2018, which was disposed of in following terms vide order dated<lb/> 28.8.2018:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;In this background, we clarify that the appointments to the posts of<lb/> Junior Office Assistant (Code 556) shall be strictly in accordance<lb/> with the Common Recruitment &amp; Promotion Rules for the posts of<lb/> Junior Office Assistant (Information Technology), Class-III (Non-<lb/>gazetted) in various Departments of Himachal Pradesh Government,<lb/> as also Advertisement No. 32-3/2016 and not in terms of<lb/> communication, dated 19 th March, 2018.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>Thus, the respondents were directed to make recruitments for JOA 556<lb/> strictly as per R&amp;P Rules.<lb/></p>

			<p>24.2 A review of judgment dated 28.8.2018 of this Court in CWP<lb/> 1964/2018 was sought by those candidates who supported the<lb/> communication dated 9.3.2018 of the State Government. Review Petition<lb/> 82 of 2018 was decided in following terms on 5.11.2018:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;5. Be that as it may, as the matter is sub-judice before the learned<lb/> Tribunal and the Committee which has submitted its report on<lb/> 21.08.2017, has been so constituted by the learned Tribunal, its<lb/> recommendations, can be looked into by the learned Tribunal<lb/> uninfluenced by any observations made by this Court in the<lb/> perspective of the Common Recruitment &amp; Promotion Rues, in the<lb/> backdrop of the controversy involved in the application before it.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The effect of judgment dated 16.8.2018 in CWP 1964/2018 was diluted<lb/> and the matters were left open to be decided by the Tribunal.<lb/></p>

			<p>24.3 Another Original Application No. 7397 of 2018 titled Naresh<lb/> Kumar and others came up for hearing before the Tribunal on the ground<lb/> that candidates with higher qualification could not be considered for<lb/> selection as settled by Supreme Court in Zahoor Ahmed Rather Vs<lb/> Sheikh Imtiaz Ahmed [ (2019) 2 SCC 404 ] and an order dated<lb/> 21.12.2018 came to be passed by the Tribunal directing HPSSC to make<lb/> selections against post code 556 strictly as per Common R&amp;P Rules and<lb/> also in consonance with decision of Supreme Court in Zahoor Ahmed<lb/> Rather (Supra). This order became subject matter of challenge in CWP<lb/> 161 of 2019 titled Bhupinder Sharma Vs State of H.P. and others before<lb/> this Court. An interim order dated 11.1.2019 was passed in CWP 161 of<lb/> 2019 to the following effect:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Meanwhile, the operation of impugned order dated 21.12.2018<lb/> (Annexure P-7), passed by Himachal Pradesh Administrative<lb/> Tribunal, in O.A. No. 7397 of 2018, shall remain stayed. However,<lb/> the Staff Selection Commission shall only allow the eligible<lb/> candidates to participate in the process.<lb/></item>

			<p>24.4. On 23.2.2019 HPSSC declared result of post code 556. Total 596<lb/> candidates were selected taking into consideration the R&amp;P Rules and<lb/> remaining 2400 candidates were rejected. Aggrieved against their ouster<lb/> from selection process, many rejected candidates approached The Tribunal.<lb/> On 26.2.2019 the Tribunal directed status quo to be maintained with<lb/> regard to issue of appointment letters in pursuance to declaration of result<lb/> of post code 556 by HPSSC in OA No. 677/2019 (CWPOA 20 of 2019).<lb/> Aggrieved against order dated 26.2.2019 passed by the Tribunal a group<lb/> of selected candidates approached this Court by filing CWP 629 of 2019.<lb/></p>

			<p>24.5. Certain candidates whose applications were rejected by the HPSSC<lb/> on the ground that they had not acquired the technical qualification from a<lb/> recognised institute filed application in CWP 161/2019 as interveners. On<lb/> 21.5.2019 Division Bench of this Court passed an interim order in CWP<lb/> 161/2019 in following terms:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;In some of the matters, which have been adjourned for 17.6.2019,<lb/> learned Advocate General has sought time for constitution of<lb/> committee to examine equivalence of academic/technical<lb/> qualification. Let the said committee comprising of 3 to 5 experts be<lb/> constituted within two weeks, which will examine all the issues<lb/> regarding recognition and genuineness of the qualifications, which<lb/> are claimed to be equivalent or higher than those prescribed under<lb/> the Recruitment and Promotion Rules. The question whether<lb/> equivalent qualification will be eligible for the advertised post is<lb/> kept open to be decided at the appropriate stage. Meanwhile, it<lb/> shall be discretion of the State Government to offer appointment to<lb/> the selected candidates strictly in order of merit on contract basis<lb/> (and not against regular posts) provided such candidates are<lb/> possessing qualification strictly as per R&amp;P Rules. These<lb/> appointments will be a stop gap arrangement and subject to<lb/> outcome of these writ petitions&quot;<lb/></item>

			<item>24.6. The committee appointed by the Government vide proceedings<lb/> dated 15.6.2019 considered three issues and made its recommendations in<lb/> following terms:<lb/></item>

			<item>(i)<lb/> Equivalence of the academic/ technical qualifications prescribed<lb/> under the Recruitment and Promotion Rules for the post of Junior Office<lb/> Assistant (IT)<lb/> Recommendation<lb/> Thus, keeping in view the facts and circumstances narrated as above the<lb/> committee unanimously concluded that no equivalent qualification can be<lb/> considered/ recommended in the absence of specific clause to this effect in<lb/> the R&amp;P Rules.<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii)<lb/> Recognition of the institutions imparting trainings and running<lb/> courses in computer/ IT related subjects;<lb/></item>

			<item>Recommendation<lb/></item>

 Thus, keeping above in view, the committee agreed that only qualification<lb/> obtained from recognised institute be considered for recruitment for<lb/> JOA(IT) and ZONE OF CONSIDERATION/ selection cannot be expanded<lb/> after start of selection process.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii)<lb/> Higher qualification vis-à-vis the minimum essential qualifications<lb/> prescribed under the Recruitment and Promotion Rules for the post.<lb/></item>

			<item>Recommendation<lb/> Hence, the committee was in consensus that the candidates with higher<lb/> qualification cannot be considered for appointment to the post of JOA(IT)<lb/> under the existing R&amp;P Rules.<lb/></item>

			<p>24.7. A division bench of this Court decided CWP 161/2019 and 629<lb/> /2019 by a common judgment dated 29.08.2019. So far as the claim of the<lb/> candidates with higher qualifications is concerned, the same was declined<lb/> on merits, however, the claim of candidates having qualified from<lb/> institutes not considered recognized by State/ HPSSC was left open. The<lb/> HPSSC while declaring the result of post Code 556 had declared only<lb/> those candidates successful who fulfilled the prescribed essential<lb/> qualifications as per R&amp;P Rules. On 17.09.219, HPSSC declared the<lb/> revised result. Thus, in pursuance to the selection process for post Code<lb/> 556 only those candidates were selected who strictly held the<lb/> qualifications as per Advertisement and R&amp;P Rules.<lb/></p>

			<p>25.<lb/> On 20.08.2019, amendment was proposed in 2014 Rules. The<lb/> candidates holding the equivalent qualifications for post Code 556<lb/> approached this Court by way of CWP No. 2246 of 2019, in which interim<lb/> direction was issued vide order dated 11.09.2019 in the following terms: -<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;In the interim, the appointments, if any, of the selected candidate(s)<lb/> against the post of J.O.A(IT) post code-556, shall be subject to the<lb/> order to be passed in the application on the next date of hearing<lb/> after taking on record the version of the respondents.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>26.<lb/> On 06.12.2019, the State Government directed the HPSSC to treat<lb/> the recruitment process for post Code 556 concluded with directions to re-<lb/>advertise/filled the unfilled and new posts after Notifications/Publication<lb/> of new common R&amp;P Rules, which were said to be under active<lb/> consideration of the Department of Personnel. The writ petitions were<lb/> filed with the reliefs identical to CWP No. 2246/2019. On 15.10.2020, a<lb/> Division Bench of this Court in a bunch of matters lead case being CWP<lb/> No. 2246 of 2019, again reiterated that the selections made pursuant to the<lb/> Notification in issue would remain subject to outcome of these petitions.<lb/> The R&amp;P Rules were finally amended and fresh Advertisement for the<lb/> post of JOA(IT) was issued against post Code 817 on 21.09.2020. On<lb/> 15.10.2020 in bunch matters referred to hereinabove, the following order<lb/> was passed by this Court:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Pursuant to Advertisement No.36-2/2020, dated 21.09.2020, issued by<lb/> respondent-HPSSC, to the posts of Junior Office Assistant (IT), the<lb/> respondent-H.P. Staff Selection Commission, Hamirpur, is permitted to<lb/> proceed with the recruitment process, however, the final result shall not<lb/> be announced without permission of this Court. Application stands<lb/> disposed of.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>27.<lb/> The HPSSC declared the result of Written Objective Type<lb/> Screening Test against post Code 817 and provisionally shortlisted total<lb/> 19024 candidates for typing skilled test.<lb/></p>

			<p>28.<lb/> Thus, three successive Advertisements were issued by the HPSSC<lb/> for recruitment to the post of JOA(IT) but as the irony would have been,<lb/> none of the selection processes have attained finality. There is challenge<lb/> to the final selection made in post Code 447 by those who held the<lb/> qualifications strictly in terms of R&amp;P Rules. Challenge to selection<lb/> process for post Code 447 is also there by the candidates who claimed<lb/> equivalent qualifications as per R&amp;P Rules but remained unsuccessful.<lb/> The selection process against post Code 556 had also been challenged by<lb/> those who either held higher or equivalent qualifications or qualifications<lb/> from institutes considered not recgnised. As regards the persons with<lb/> higher qualifications probably their fate stands sealed by the judgment<lb/> passed by a Division Bench of this Court in CWP No. 161 of 2019, but all<lb/> other challenges were still alive.<lb/></p>

			<p>29.<lb/> As regards the selection process for JOA 447, we already have<lb/> held the decision of State Government dated 21.8.2017 and 18.9.2017 as<lb/> also the selections/appointments made in pursuance thereto as legal and<lb/> valid. Now the next question which remains to be decided relates to the<lb/> selection process undertaken by the HPSSC for JOA 556 and the conduct<lb/> of respondents-State in respect thereof. As noticed above, the<lb/> advertisement for the Post Code 556 for 1156 posts was issued by the<lb/> HPSSC on 18.10.2016. Total 85 posts out of advertised posts were to be<lb/> filled on regular basis and rest on contract basis. The prescribed minimum<lb/> essential qualification was again as per R &amp; P Rules and, therefore, in the<lb/> same language as in the case of Post Code 447. Despite the<lb/> communication of the State Government to HPSSC dated 19.3.2018 to<lb/> adopt the same procedure in selection process as was adopted in selection<lb/> process of Post Code 447 in pursuance to the Government decision dated<lb/> 21.8.2017 read with 8.9.2017, the selections and appointments were made<lb/> by applying the 2014 Rules strictly. Thus, the allowance given to<lb/> candidates in selection process of Post Code 447 was withdrawn in<lb/> selection process of Post Code 556. The reason, as appears from the<lb/> record, was various interim orders passed by Tribunal/Courts from time to<lb/> time and also the constitution of another Equivalence Committee by the<lb/> State Government, which had recommended to apply the 2014 Rules<lb/> strictly without deviation. Noticeably, out of 1156 advertised posts only<lb/> 596 candidates were declared qualified, selected and appointed.<lb/></p>

			<p>30.<lb/> Evidently, the reason for constitution of another equivalence<lb/> committee was an interim order passed on 21.5.2019 by a Division Bench<lb/> of this Court in CWP No. 161 of 2019. The second Equivalence<lb/> Committee had given its recommendations on 15.6.2019.<lb/> 31.<lb/> The question that arises for determination is whether the<lb/> application of different set of rules contemporaneously for the same post<lb/> by the respondents is justified? The only defence the respondents are<lb/> relying is an interim order passed by Division Bench of this Court on<lb/> 21.5.2019 in CWP No. 161 of 2019 and the consequent constitution of<lb/> second equivalence committee. The perusal of aforesaid order, however,<lb/> reveals that there was no direction from this Court as such for appointment<lb/> of equivalence committee. It was specifically noticed that the learned<lb/> Advocate General had sought time for constitution of Committee to<lb/> examine equivalence of academic/technical qualification. It was in this<lb/> context that this Court ordered for appointment of an equivalence<lb/> committee required to examine all issues regarding recognition and<lb/> genuineness of the qualifications which were claimed to be equivalent or<lb/> higher than those prescribed under the R &amp; P Rules. It is worth noticing<lb/> that vide same order the question whether equivalent qualification will be<lb/> eligible for the advertised post was kept open to be decided at the<lb/> appropriate stage. In this view of the matter, the respondents cannot be<lb/> allowed to take shelter of aforesaid order dated 21.5.2019 passed in CWP<lb/> No. 161 of 2019 and especially when even while disposing of the said writ<lb/> petition finally this Court had left the question of equivalence and<lb/> recognition institutes open.<lb/></p>

			<p>32.<lb/> There is nothing on record to suggest that the State Government<lb/> having once issued communication dated 19.3.2018 had ever issued any<lb/> correspondence subsequently to withdraw the directions issued to HPSSC.<lb/> In absence of such an exercise, it is not understandable as to on what basis<lb/> the HPSSC declared the result by considering the qualifications strictly as<lb/> per the R &amp; P Rules. Probably, this had resulted in view of interim orders<lb/> passed in different applications/petitions filed before the Tribunals/Courts.<lb/> Be that as it may be, the question as posed above is still alive. The mere<lb/> fact that second equivalence committee was constituted and it had<lb/> recommended to apply the 2014 Rules strictly cannot be held sufficient<lb/> reason for the respondents to ignore their earlier decision dated 21.8.2017<lb/> made applicable to Post Code 556 vide communication dated 19.3.2018.<lb/> Indisputably, these decisions were neither withdrawn nor nullified by any<lb/> subsequent act of the State Government. Once the State Government had<lb/> exercised its power to relax the R &amp; P Rules, there had to be a conscious<lb/> decision again of the State Government to revert back to the original<lb/> position, which is clearly missing in the instant case. There is nothing on<lb/> record to suggest that the recommendations made by second equivalence<lb/> committee were even considered by the Government/ employer much less<lb/> accepted at any stage. That being so, the recommendations of second<lb/> equivalence committee cannot by themselves have the effect of nullifying<lb/> the decision dated 21.8.2017/9.3.2017 made applicable to Post Code 556<lb/> vide communication dated 19.3.2018. Thus, the denial of the right to all<lb/> persons similarly situated to those, who were considered for selection in<lb/> Post Code 447 from outside the purview of 2014 Rules is clearly arbitrary<lb/> and needs to be interfered with.<lb/></p>

			<p>33.<lb/> Thus, the HPSSC is directed to re-cast the merit list for JOA 556<lb/> by including all categories of candidate as was done for JOA 447 on the<lb/> basis of decision of Government dated 21.8.2017/18.9.2017 and further<lb/> made applicable to JOA 556 vide communication 19.3.2018 except the<lb/> candidates with higher qualification, who have already been held ineligible<lb/> vide judgment dated 29.8.2019 of a Division Bench of this Court in CWP<lb/> 161/2019. These selections for JOA 556 shall be made by taking into<lb/> account the entire number of vacancies advertised for JOA 556 and the<lb/> decision of the Government/HPSSC to close the selection procedure for<lb/> JOA 556 is set aside and quashed.<lb/></p>

			<p>34.<lb/> Since the Common R&amp;P Rules stand amended by 2020 Rules and<lb/> the cause of persistent confusion for the time being appears to have been<lb/> removed, as a necessary consequence selection for JOA 817 shall take<lb/> place in accordance with 2020 Rules, however, the selection process shall<lb/> not include the selection for posts which were left over from advertised<lb/> posts of JOA 556 as the said posts have already been directed to be filled<lb/> through selection process of JOA 556.<lb/></p>

			<p>35.<lb/> In view of above discussion and directions, all the petitions<lb/> considered herein are decided accordingly:<lb/></p>

			<item>(a)<lb/> CWPOA 34 of 2019 is dismissed. CWPOAs 2253, 2289, 2290,<lb/> 2388, 2394 and 7681 of 2020 have been rendered infructuous.<lb/></item>
