			<p>MAC.APP. 166/2019<lb/> KAMLESH<lb/> .....Appellant<lb/> versus<lb/> 1.<lb/> These appeals impugn the award of compensation passed by learned<lb/> MACT on the ground; that there was no valid insurance policy between the<lb/> appellant-insurer and the owner of the offending motor vehicle, on the date<lb/> of the accident. All claims arose from the same motor vehicular tragedy.<lb/> The facts of the case are that on 22 nd September, 2014, at around 5:15 in the<lb/> evening, a passenger bus was plying in western Uttar Pradesh, it was packed<lb/> with over 82 passengers, against the permitted seating capacity of 52+2<lb/> passengers in terms of the insurance policy. Little did the passengers, know<lb/> that they were moments away from a disaster. En route, one of the<lb/> passengers had told the conductor and the driver of the bus that there was<lb/> smell of gas in the bus and it should be looked into. Other passengers too,<lb/> joined in the chorus of the requests and protests. One of the passengers had<lb/> deposed that he had personally requested the conductor and the driver to<lb/> stop the vehicle but they paid no heed to him. Similarly, the repeated<lb/> requests of the other passengers too, went unheeded. The bus was being<lb/> driven at a very high speed, as if to defeat time itself. Moments later, smoke<lb/> emanated in the bus and then it exploded, resulting in 31 fatalities and 51<lb/> grievous injuries. The injured were maimed for life. Miraculously, both the<lb/> driver and the conductor escaped unhurt. What was the fault of the<lb/> passengers? None. They were innocent. The driver and conductor were at<lb/> fault for ignoring the repeated calls and entreaties for caution and the need<lb/> for immediate safety measures to be taken. The rash and negligent driving of<lb/> the offending bus is evident.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> The State Government acknowledged the bus blast tragedy which had<lb/> affected scores of families. It extended some ex gratia payments to the<lb/> affected parties. An FIR No. 151/2014 was registered at Police Station<lb/> Shikarpur, for offences punishable under sections 285, 337, 338 and 427 of<lb/> the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Claim Petitions were filed for compensation<lb/> under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The owner and the driver of the vehicle<lb/> were arrested, but within a week, they were granted bail. The Court is<lb/> informed that they continue to remain on bail.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> The injured/claimants and kin of the deceased sought compensation<lb/> on various grounds from the insured/owner of the vehicle. Their misery,<lb/> occasioned from the blast in the bus, is not in dispute. Although, the owner<lb/> of the vehicle did take a stand that there was nothing on record to prove that<lb/> they were travelling in the said bus; that they have not produced any<lb/> passenger tickets in this regard. The said statement is ex facie callous as it<lb/> shows complete disregard for human life and limb. In this case, the non-<lb/>production of passenger tickets could have been only because of the same<lb/> having been destroyed in the fire caused due to the blast in the bus, the<lb/> numerous deaths and extensive life-altering injuries; the ghastly aftermath in<lb/> which human bodies would have been flung about and the same cannot be<lb/> said to cast an impediment on the injured persons. The factum of their<lb/> injuries and casualties due to the blast in the bus has been recorded by the<lb/> jurisdictional police. Therefore, their being passengers in the offending bus,<lb/> stands proven.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> The bus owner-Mr. Vipin Kumar produced its Registration No.<lb/> DL-1-PA-3059 and on the insurance Cover Note bearing No. CVL 0464404<lb/> dated 17.09.2014, against third-party claims. It extended coverage to a<lb/> seating capacity of 52+2 persons, valid from 18.09.2014 till 17.09.2015.<lb/> A premium of Rs. 36,968/-is stated to have been paid by the owner for the<lb/> Cover Note. The accident happened four days later on 22.09.2014. On the<lb/> basis of this Cover Note, an insurance policy was issued by the appellant on<lb/> 30.09.2014.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> The insurer had contested the Cover Note on the ground that: i) it was<lb/> fraudulently procured by the owner, in connivance with of its agent-<lb/>Sandeep Kumar; ii) the Certificate of an insurance policy issued by it on<lb/> 30.09.2014 covered only 18 persons, including the driver and a premium<lb/> amount of only Rs. 18,130/-was paid for the same; iii) the owner<lb/> approached the insurer in November, 2014 seeking enhancement of the<lb/> carrying capacity of the passengers in the said bus by way of a letter, and<lb/> further payment of the requisite premium of Rs. 18,836/-; iv) a fresh<lb/> endorsement was issued on 01.12.2014 against a subsequent additional<lb/> premium payment of Rs. 18,836/-; v) in law, the said endorsement was of<lb/> no consequence, because the vehicle apropos which the said endorsement or<lb/> enhancement of carrying capacity was sought and made, did not exist on that<lb/> date, as it had already been blown to smithereens, two months earlier. It is<lb/> the appellant&quot;s case that the contract of insurance is based on the principle of<lb/> &quot;uberrima fides&apos; i.e. utmost good faith. The proposer seeking insurance is<lb/> required to disclose to the insurer the complete facts apropos the goods or<lb/> vehicles or substances which are sought to be insured. In the present case,<lb/> since the vehicle had already suffered extensive damage resulting in loss of<lb/> scores of life and injuries to many others, therefore, the endorsement was<lb/> void. It is argued that at best the insurer would be liable only to return the<lb/> additional premium amount i.e. Rs. 18,836/-, alongwith interest accrued<lb/> thereon.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> The insurer further contends that the Cover Note purportedly<lb/> extended to the owner, through the insurer&quot;s agent-Sandeep Kumar, was an<lb/> act of fraud, not only on the insurance company but upon the public at large,<lb/> as well as upon the Transport Authority; that fraudulent acts of this nature<lb/> should never be treated lightly and should be dealt with in the sternest<lb/> manner. The appellant contends that the vehicle owner had furnished a<lb/> Proposal Form, alongwith a copy of the insurance Cover Note, purportedly<lb/> issued by United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Dehradun. However, upon<lb/> verification through RTI, it was established that no such Cover Note had<lb/> been issued by United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Additionally, the<lb/> Registration Certificate of the said vehicle shows its seating capacity as<lb/> 17+1. Therefore all these documents, which purportedly led to the issuance<lb/> of the Cover Note, were misleading. The resultant Cover Note should,<lb/> therefore, be considered void. The insurer refers to the admission of the<lb/> vehicle owner, that after its purchase about 6-7 years earlier, he had never<lb/> sought its insurance cover on any occasion. Therefore, it is argued, that<lb/> when there is no insurance policy or if it was otherwise obtained through<lb/> fraud, the insurer would not be liable for any indemnification. Reference is<lb/> also made to section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to contend, that<lb/> third party liability would not ensue where the policy was void on account of<lb/> non-disclosure. Section 149(2) (b) reads as under:-<lb/>-</p>

			<item>149. Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments and awards<lb/> against persons insured in respect of third party risks.-<lb/></item>

			<item>(1) If, after a certificate of insurance has been issued<lb/> under sub-section (3) of section 147 in favour of the person by<lb/> whom a policy has been effected, judgment or award in respect<lb/> of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy<lb/> under clause (b) of sub-section (l) of section 147 (being a<lb/> liability covered by the terms of the policy) 1[or under the<lb/> provisions of section 163A] is obtained against any person<lb/> insured by the policy, then, notwithstanding that the insurer<lb/> may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or<lb/> cancelled the policy, the insurer shall, subject to the provisions<lb/> of this section, pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the<lb/> decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable<lb/> thereunder, as if he were the judgment debtor, in respect of the<lb/> liability, together with any amount payable in respect of costs<lb/> and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue<lb/> of any enactment relating to interest on judgments.<lb/></item>

			<item>(2) No sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub-<lb/>section (1) in respect of any judgment or award unless, before<lb/> the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment or<lb/> award is given the insurer had notice through the Court or, as<lb/> the case may be, the Claims Tribunal of the bringing of the<lb/> proceedings, or in respect of such judgment or award so long as<lb/> execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal; and an insurer<lb/> to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so<lb/> given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend<lb/> the action on any of the following grounds, namely:<lb/></item>

			<item>(a) that there has been a breach of a specified condition<lb/> of the policy, being one of the following conditions, namely:-<lb/></item>

			<item>(i) a condition excluding the use of the vehicle-<lb/></item>

			<item>(a) for hire or reward, where the vehicle is on the date<lb/> of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit<lb/> to ply for hire or reward, or<lb/></item>

			<item>(b) for organised racing and speed testing, or<lb/></item>

			<item>(c) for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which<lb/> the vehicle is used, where the vehicle is a transport vehicle, or<lb/> (d) without side-car being attached where the vehicle is<lb/> a motor cycle; or<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) a condition excluding driving by a named person or<lb/> persons or by any person who is not duly licensed, or by any<lb/> person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a<lb/> driving licence during the period of disqualification; or<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) a condition excluding liability for injury caused or<lb/> contributed to by conditions of war, civil war, riot or civil<lb/> commotion; or<lb/></item>

			<item>(b) that the policy is void on the ground that it was<lb/> obtained by the non-disclosure of a material fact or by a<lb/> representation of fact which was false in some material<lb/> particular.<lb/> ....‖<lb/></item>

			<item>(emphasis supplied)<lb/></item>

			<p>7.<lb/> The impugned order has, however, found the vehicle to be insured at<lb/> the time of the accident and held the appellant liable to pay the awarded<lb/> compensation. It has reasoned as under:-<lb/>-</p>

			<item>62. Respondent No. 4 is the insurance company which<lb/> admittedly had issued a valid insurance policy of the<lb/> offending vehicle. There is no evidence on behalf of<lb/> respondent No. 4 to show that there was any violation of the<lb/> rules and terms of policy by the respondent No. 1 to 3.<lb/> Hence, I am of the opinion that respondent No. 4 being<lb/> insurance company is liable to pay the compensation on<lb/> behalf of respondent No. 1 to 3. Interim award if any paid to<lb/> injured/petitioner be adjusted in the award amount.‖<lb/></item>

			<p>8.<lb/> The impugned order does not hold the owner and the driver liable for<lb/> rash and negligent driving for the following reasons:<lb/> -</p>

			<item>21. To succeed in the claim petitions, it is for the<lb/> claimants to prove that vehicle which caused the accident was<lb/> being driven rashly and negligently by its driver / respondent.<lb/> No.1. In all the cases, petitioners / injured examined<lb/> themselves as PW and deposed about the facts of the case. In<lb/> the claim petition, it is itself contended that the injury or death<lb/> was caused due to the fire by the burst of the cylinder.<lb/> Admittedly the chargesheet has been filed for offence U/s<lb/> 285/337/338/427 IPC and respondent No. 1 has not been<lb/> charged for the offence of rash and negligent driving. The<lb/> testimony of witnesses is not sufficient to prove the rash and<lb/> negligent driving by respondent No. 1 at all. The testimony of<lb/> witnesses was further shattered during cross examination and<lb/> admittedly the compensation was also granted by the State<lb/> Government in respect of the said incident to the victims. In<lb/> view of the testimony of witnesses on records and relevant<lb/> documents like claim petition and chargesheet, the incident<lb/> had happened due to the leakage of gas from the cylinder<lb/> which resulting the gas caught fire and fire spread in the bus.<lb/> The rash and negligent driving of the driver respondent No.1<lb/> is not proved at all resulting into the injuries or death of the<lb/> passengers.<lb/> Ld. counsel for respondents vehemently argued that the<lb/> petitioners are not entitled for compensation as rash and<lb/> negligent driving of respondent No. 1 is not proved at all and<lb/> relied upon the judgments reported as The Oriental Insurance<lb/> Company V/s Meena Varival S Ors. Minu B. Mehta &amp; Ors V/s<lb/> Balkrishna Ramchandra Navan &amp; Ors. Surender Kumar Arora<lb/> Ors. V/S Dr. Manoj Bisla &amp; Ors. &amp; Oriental Insurance<lb/> Company Ltd. Vs. Premlata Shukla &amp; Ors in support of<lb/> contentions.<lb/> After perusal of the records and testimony of the<lb/> witnesses, it appears that the negligence of the respondent No.<lb/> 1 is not proved therefore the claim petition filed by petitioners;<lb/> U/s 166 &amp;140 of MV Act, 1988 for grant of compensation is<lb/> treated as claim petition U/s 163 A MV Act for grant of<lb/> compensation. Issue No. 1 in all the cases are disposed off<lb/> accordingly.‖<lb/></item>

			<p>9.<lb/> The appellant further argues that fraud apropos the Cover Note, is<lb/> established from the fact that the agent-Sandeep Kumar was operating from<lb/> Chandigarh, whereas the owner of the vehicle was from Bulandshahr.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. The appellant&quot;s contentions are refuted by learned counsel for the<lb/> vehicle owner. He contends that the Cover Note was a valid document and<lb/> for its issuance, he had paid the demanded premium amount of Rs. 36,968/-.<lb/> Interestingly, in his cross-examination he was not confronted with any<lb/> suggestion of the Cover Note being fraudulently obtained. Evidently, the<lb/> insurer never doubted the legitimacy and genuineness of the Cover Note<lb/> throughout the claim proceedings. Seeking to question it now is a misplaced<lb/> attempt at valiance. It is untenable and ought to be rejected. The vehicle<lb/> owner contends that the said letter of request, purportedly seeking<lb/> endorsement of enhancement of passenger carrying capacity in November,<lb/> 2014, was never written by him nor was any additional premium paid by<lb/> him either in cash or by way of any banking transaction, such as cheque or<lb/> Demand Draft.<lb/></p>

			<p>11. The respondent contends that the place of residence or geographical<lb/> area of operations of the agent and the residence of the owner was never an<lb/> issue before the learned Tribunal. Furthermore, under the Cover Note, the<lb/> Service Branch of the insurer is shown at Chandigarh. It is not anyone&quot;s case<lb/> that Sandeep, whose contact number is mentioned in the policy, was<lb/> operating only in Chandigarh or that he was not operating in Bulandshahr.<lb/> There is neither any administrative bar nor legal impediment in the issuance<lb/> of such policy or Cover Note. Therefore, mere separation of the insurer&quot;s<lb/> Service Branch and the address of the vehicle owner by a couple of hundred<lb/> kilometers, cannot be a reason to suspect that the Cover Note was obtained<lb/> fraudulently. Besides, in today&quot;s world of instant communication,<lb/> geographical distances have become irrelevant.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. The vehicle owner further argues that there could be a case of fraud<lb/> only if the owner had produced documents apropos the alleged fraudulent<lb/> ownership of the vehicle or that he had disclosed incorrect facts or set-up a<lb/> case that the insurance policy would be voidable only if complete facts had<lb/> not been disclosed. But the insurer has not proven that any untrue facts were<lb/> given to it in any communication by the vehicle owner. The owner argues<lb/> that all that was required for him was to produce the documents which<lb/> formed the basis of the insurance Cover Note. He did so and after being<lb/> satisfied with his documents and without any reservation, the insurer did<lb/> issue the Cover Note w.e.f. 18.09.2014 valid for a year. The requisite<lb/> premium amount was paid in cash, it has been so testified in evidence. The<lb/> respondent contends that the letter seeking correction of the policy, for<lb/> endorsing its coverage from 17+1 persons to 52+2 persons was in the<lb/> context that the policy was not in consonance with the Cover Note, as stated<lb/> in his affidavit. He has categorically denied that he had paid any additional<lb/> monies or premium in cash for the corrective endorsement. The owner had<lb/> produced the following documents i.e. Cover Note:<lb/></p>

			<p>13. The insurer&quot;s version of Certificate of Insurance and Policy Schedule<lb/> issued on the basis of the said Cover Note is as under:-<lb/></p>

			<p>14. The letter seeking endorsement upto 52+2 persons reads as under:-<lb/></p>

			<p>15. Accordingly to the insurer, the receipt of additional premium<lb/> (pg. 291) and the corresponding endorsement (pg.339) read as under:-<lb/></p>

			<p>16. The appellant states that the Cover Note which was given to them by<lb/> the insurer&quot;s agent and had been filed before the learned Tribunal is as<lb/> under:-<lb/></p>

			<p>17. The appellant submits that the actual document which was received<lb/> by it is the one which has been handed over to the Court and reproduced in<lb/> the preceding paragraph. Copy of the same has been handed over to the<lb/> learned counsel for the vehicle owner. The latter submits that this new<lb/> document was never a part of the records of the learned Tribunal, instead<lb/> what is found on the record of the learned Tribunal is the document<lb/> reproduced in para 12 (supra). The &quot;insurer&quot;s copy&quot; reproduced below<lb/> shows some discrepancies such as: i) seating capacity shows 17+2, yet<lb/> significantly the imprint of 52+2 is shown below the 17+2 and ii) the agent<lb/> code has been added in handwriting, which according to the respondent is a<lb/> self-serving endorsement and does not make the insurer&quot;s copy more<lb/> reliable, because the Cover Note number is the most relevant and significant<lb/> identifier of its veracity.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. The Court would note that two copies of the cover note have been<lb/> produced before this Court: one which was filed before the learned Tribunal<lb/> that showed premium of Rs. 18,130/-but did not bear any cover note<lb/> number; whereas the document handed over to the Court, it does bear that<lb/> number, which is CVL 0464404. Although, the latter document shows a<lb/> seating capacity of 17+1 yet in its middle, just above the column where the<lb/> date of registration is mentioned, there is a faint endorsement of 52+2. The<lb/> amount of Rs. 36,968/-as insurance premium, is the computation for four<lb/> heads of insurance cover. There is an overwriting on the first figure i.e. Rs.<lb/> 7,843/-by the amount of Rs. 18,130/-with a dark hand written imprint. How<lb/> this larger amount came about, is not explained by the insurer. On the<lb/> insurer&quot;s copy, which has been shown to the Court, the Cover Note issued to<lb/> the vehicle owner has the amount of Rs. 36,968/-, which is inscribed at the<lb/> lower end of the body of the said document. The same amount is also<lb/> mentioned in the first para of the document. However, this figure is<lb/> inexplicably missing from the document now produced by the insurer. It has<lb/> two additional endorsements, one on top of the page showing the address of<lb/> the office of the insurer as Sector 40-C, Chandigarh and another<lb/> endorsement of claim intimation number, and then the Cover Note number.<lb/> The document on record of the learned Tribunal does not have these<lb/> endorsements. The owner had deposed in his cross examination that he had<lb/> paid the entire monies in cash to the insurer&quot;s agent.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. The insurer contends that the insurer&quot;s Proposal Form alongwith<lb/> documents annexed thereto i.e. Registration Certificate and prior insurance<lb/> certificates, clearly show that details of the vehicle were not properly filled<lb/> in. Therefore, the insurance policy issued by them was in breach of good<lb/> faith hence it would be void ab initio. The vehicle owner argues that the<lb/> element of fraud is not made out because the insurance policy issued on<lb/> 30.09.2014 has not been produced by the insurer which mentions the Cover<lb/> Note bearing No. 0464404. It reads inter alia:-<lb/>-</p>

			<item>In witness whereof this policy has been signed at<lb/> Chennai on 30/09/2014 in lieu of Cover note No. CVL0464404<lb/> dated 17.09.2019 Receipt No. CBCMOR 1935511.‖<lb/></item>

			<p>20. The learned counsel for the respondent contends that as far as the<lb/> insured is concerned, he paid the monies to the agent and not to the<lb/> company. He has categorically deposed that the insurance premium was paid<lb/> in cash. Therefore, there was no question of any subsequent payment. The<lb/> insurance company has accepted the monies in cash or through banking<lb/> transactions, which is noted in the subsequent document of 28.11.2014; it<lb/> mentions that it is drawn on ICICI Bank, Chennai. Details of the said<lb/> financial instrument, as may be, ought to have been produced by the insurer<lb/> to promptly ascertain whether such payments were made by the vehicle<lb/> owner. But the insurer chose not to do so. The insured had deposed as<lb/> under (pdf pg. 134 of MAC APP. 23/2019):-<lb/>-</p>

I have purchased it about 6 -7 years<lb/> before the accident and after my purchase get the insurance<lb/> but the insurance was not taken in every year.

I cannot tell the name of insurance company form<lb/> which I purchased the policy during this period and therefore<lb/> I cannot produce the particulars of the said policy.

No inflammable articles are allowed to be carried<lb/> in the vehicle.<lb/> Do you get the fitness certificate and permit issued of your<lb/> vehicle every year and if yes, from which authority it is being<lb/> issued?<lb/> Disallowed being not relevant and specific to the period of<lb/> accident.)<lb/></item>

			<item>I do not file my ITR.<lb/> My conductor did not have any conductor license not<lb/> conductor maintained any register regarding the goods<lb/> carried by any passenger. I do not remember whether I<lb/> signed the proposal form or not for policy and how much<lb/> number of passenger was shown in the proposal form. It is<lb/> wrong to suggest the Ex. RW1/5 is fake document. After the<lb/> accident I did not use the vehicle. I cannot give any reason<lb/> why I visited he company on 01.12.2014 for endorsement in<lb/> the policy regarding the sitting capacity. I have not disclosed<lb/> regarding the accident while getting the endorsement of<lb/> sitting capacity. My bus was not attached with any<lb/> educational institute at the time of accident. It is wrong the<lb/> suggest that I have mentioned the same in proposal from. I<lb/> am not an eye witness to the accident not I was present in the<lb/> bus at the time accident. One criminal case is pending<lb/> against me regarding the accident in question. I knew the<lb/> agent Sandeep Kumar being an insurance agent only and did<lb/> not know before the policy . It is wrong to suggest that I in<lb/> collusion with the said Sandeep Kumar obtained the<lb/> insurance cover note after occurrence of the accident on<lb/> 22.09.2014. It is wrong to suggest that I had permitted the<lb/> driver and conductor of the bus to permit the passengers to<lb/> carry inflammable goods / cylinder in the bus against hire or<lb/> that there is gross violation of provisions of motor vehicle<lb/> rules / act on my part. It is wrong to suggest that I am<lb/> deposing falsely to avoid my liability/.<lb/></item>

			<item>Xxxxx by Counsel for petitioners.<lb/></item>

			<item>NIL. Opportunity given‖<lb/> emphasis supplied<lb/></item>

			<p>21. What emanates from the preceding discussions, documents and<lb/> testimony is that the document relied upon by the insurer, as the one which<lb/> allegedly formed the basis of the issuance of the Cover Note, was never<lb/> given to the insurer by the vehicle owner. The latter&quot;s testimony that he had<lb/> paid the monies in cash for the issuance of the Cover Note remains unshaken<lb/> in his cross-examination. The cash amount is mentioned in the second line<lb/> of the said document, which is Rs. 36,968/-on the basis of the computation<lb/> made on the body of the said document. Anomaly, if any, the &quot;Insurer&quot;s<lb/> Copy&quot; which must have been deposited with the insurer by its agent, is an<lb/> explanation which it should seek from the agent. The discrepancy apropos<lb/> the Cover Note given to the vehicle owner and the Insurer&quot;s Copy kept by its<lb/> agent, has to be solved between the agent and the Principal. Additionally,<lb/> the stamp on the top of the document makes it complete; whereas the<lb/> document relied upon by the appellant does not even bear the cover number.<lb/> It was for the insurer to produce documents to prove that the Cover Note<lb/> was obtained fraudulently. But it failed to do so. Except for the averments<lb/> that they have filed cases against the agent-Sandeep, the appellant has not<lb/> brought on record as to what action has been taken against him. It has also<lb/> not asked him about the discrepancy, if any, in receipt of Rs. 36,968/-which<lb/> was purportedly paid by the insured to the agent. Where the vehicle owner<lb/> had applied to the insurer for issuance of an insurance cover and had paid<lb/> the due premium and then received an unqualified Cover Note, it constitutes<lb/> a valid transaction and would call for no review or doubt unless evidence is<lb/> brought on record to show that the same was rooted in fraud. Despite due<lb/> opportunities having been accorded to the insurer, it has not been able to<lb/> prove that the policy was fraudulently obtained.<lb/></p>

			<p>22. The insurer argues that it had not been intimated about the tragedy<lb/> with the bus. The Court is of the view that in the special facts of the present<lb/> case, such non-intimation, resulting in loss of lives of scores of people, the<lb/> shock and enormity of the tragedy would have numbed anyone. Therefore, it<lb/> cannot be held against the insured. Besides, it was such a major accident<lb/> that everybody in the area and also in areas beyond it knew about it. The<lb/> Government of Uttar Pradesh had extended ex gratia payments to the<lb/> victims of the said disaster. The insurer and the agent are deemed to have<lb/> knowledge of the same. Therefore, this argument too is rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>23. At this stage, the learned counsel for the appellant submits that the<lb/> cheque bearing no. 832635 mentioned in the cover note filed at page 565 of<lb/> the LCR which they had relied upon, is the cheque issued by the agent. In<lb/> other words, it was not a cheque issued by the owner who had said that he<lb/> had paid the monies in cash. It is also not proven by the insurer that whether<lb/> the second cheque for an amount of Rs. 18,836/-which was paid for the<lb/> endorsement, was ever issued by the owner. When the appellant-insurer<lb/> itself has been unable to prove that either of the cheques were issued by the<lb/> owner, there is no reason to assume that the payments had been made by a<lb/> cheque. The testimony of the owner supported by the recording in the cover<lb/> note that he had paid Rs. 36,968/-, has gone unrebutted.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. The insurer stresses that the vehicle owner&quot;s silence apropos the<lb/> insurer&quot;s legal notice, is proof of the owner&quot;s complicity with the insurer&quot;s<lb/> agent. The aforesaid argument is ex facie fallacious and rejected because if<lb/> the Cover Note is valid, the vehicle owner&quot;s conduct cannot undo the<lb/> insurer&quot;s contractual liability. The owner&quot;s conduct post accident is a<lb/> separate issue. It will primarily examine his negligence in the accident<lb/> apropos third party claims.<lb/></p>

			<p>25. In the facts of the case as discussed hereinabove, where a vehicle<lb/> having a seating capacity of 52+2 carries passengers in excess thereof, there<lb/> would be a breach of Motor Vehicles Rules. However, that by itself would<lb/> not be a breach of the policy condition. The insurer&quot;s liability would be<lb/> limited to the number of persons to which the insurance Cover Note<lb/> provides i.e. 52+2, the plus two being the driver and the conductor. In the<lb/> present case, neither the conductor nor the driver has suffered any injuries,<lb/> therefore, there is no liability cast upon the insurer to cover their damages.<lb/> Now the question to be examined is: Whether the accident happened<lb/> because of rashness and negligence on behalf of the driver and the<lb/> conductor?<lb/></p>

			<p>26. The overloading of passengers in the bus, to almost twice its carrying<lb/> capacity is not just negligence but an act of callous disregard to human<lb/> safety and dignity. It cannot be denied that in areas where transport<lb/> facilities are not adequate, village folk and commuters from small towns,<lb/> hop-on and board any infrequent bus which comes along, because there may<lb/> not be another bus for that day. One passenger alighting from the bus has<lb/> deposed that he smelled gas inside the bus and told the conductor and the<lb/> driver to get it checked. There was an immediate and simultaneous chorus<lb/> of protest and requests from a number of the other passengers to check the<lb/> smell or leakage of gas, but throwing caution to the winds the bus sped on,<lb/> unmindful of their protests, requests and entreaties. Moments later, the gas<lb/> spread in the bus, there was an explosion ending many lives and<lb/> permanently maiming many others.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. In MAC.APP.No. 55/2019, PW-2 Subhash has tendered his evidence<lb/> by way of affidavit, which states as under:<lb/> -</p>

			<item>I, Subhash S/o Sh. Bhagwat Singh aged about 40 years<lb/> R/o Village: Davar Arniya, Tehsil: Khurja, Distt.<lb/> Bulandshahr, U.P. at present Delhi, do hereby solemnly affirm<lb/> and declare as under:<lb/></item>

			<item>1. That the deponent being the eye witness in the above<lb/> noted matter is well conversant with the facts of the case and<lb/> competent to sewer the present affidavit.<lb/></item>

			<item>2. That on the most unfortunate day of 22.09.2014, I have<lb/> boarding the Bus bearing No. DL 1PA 0359 from Khurja for<lb/> going to Jahagirabad, Bulandshahr U.P. and many other<lb/> passengers were also travelling in the same Bus.<lb/></item>

			<item>3. That the conductor as well as the driver of the said Bus<lb/> was very careless &amp; negligent towards his duty and<lb/> intentionally &amp; knonwingly carrying the goods in the said Bus<lb/> which was prohibited by Law for fetching the huge amount by<lb/> illegal means.<lb/></item>

			<item>4. That on the date of accident, inspite of the objections<lb/> raised by the passengers the driver &amp; conductor of the said<lb/> Bus has loaded the Gas Cylinder in the Bus without caring the<lb/> life of the passengers. The Bus driven by its driver at a very<lb/> high speed and negligent manner, at about 5.15 p.m. when the<lb/> Bus reached near Village: Kutubpur on Jahagirabad road<lb/> there was a smell of gas spread in the Bus due to lekage of gas<lb/> from Cylinder. The passengers asked the driver as well as<lb/> conductor of the Bus to stop the Bus as there was a leakage of<lb/> Gas but the driver as well as conductor did not pay any<lb/> attention towards the request made by the passengers and<lb/> drove the Bus carelessly at a very high speed, resulting<lb/> whereof the gas caught fire and spread into the bus and made<lb/> a heavy blast.<lb/></item>

			<item>5. That I hardly saved my life as I was standing at the<lb/> back door due to heavy rush in the Bus and after hearing the<lb/> crying of the other passengers &amp; feel the smell of burning, I<lb/> had jumped out from the running Bus when the driver slow the<lb/> speed for a moment just before the blast.<lb/></item>

			<item>6. That after hearing huge crying of the passengers due<lb/> to the heavy burning, public persons gathered on spot and try<lb/> to set off the fire and made a call to the police as well as fire<lb/> brigade, after some time police arrived on spot &amp; inquired<lb/> about the accident and all the injured were taken to the Govt.<lb/> Hospital, Bulandshahr U.P.<lb/> 7. That due to the carelessly and negligently act of the<lb/> driver and conductor of the Bus many passengers were burnt<lb/> resulting into their deaths and some also badly burnt and<lb/> sustained grievous injuries in this accident.<lb/></item>

			<item>8. That this accident has absolutely been caused due to<lb/> rash &amp; negligent driving of respondent no. 1. Had the<lb/> respondent no.1 been vigilant, cautious enough and ought to<lb/> have driven the vehicle in question by observing proper look<lb/> out and taking necessary precautious and pay attention<lb/> towards the request made by the passengers, the said accident<lb/> has been very easily averted and the passengers could not<lb/> sustained fatal injuries. It is the duty of the respondent no.1 to<lb/> drive the vehicle in question by observing the Traffic rules.<lb/></item>

			<item>9. That this accident has absolutely been caused due to<lb/> rash &amp; negligent driving of the driver of Bus bearing No. DL<lb/> 1PA 0359.<lb/></item>

			<item>10. That this accident has seen by me through my necked<lb/> eye as stated above and nothing has been conceal.<lb/></item>

			<item>11. That the deponent has signed on this affidavit at point<lb/> ‗A&apos;&amp; ‗B&apos; and filed the copy of his Aadhar Card which is<lb/> exhibited as Pw-3/1.‖<lb/></item>

			<p>28. Similarly in his cross examination, it was recorded as under:<lb/> -<lb/></p>

			<item>The route of the bus was from Khurja to Jahangirabad.<lb/> The police never recorded my statement. (Vol. The police<lb/> had orally enquired from me at the spot.) I cannot tell the<lb/> name of the police official. I remained at the spot for about<lb/> one hour after the accident. The police had reached at the<lb/> spot after 45 minutes of the accident. I myself did not<lb/> inform the police about the accident. One passer by had<lb/> informed the police regarding the accident but I do not<lb/> know the whereabouts of informer / passerby. I do not have<lb/> any bus ticket to show that I was travelling in the said bus.<lb/></item>

			<item>(vol. Conductor did not give me any ticket as he was not<lb/> giving ticket to the passengers traveling for short distance.)<lb/></item>

			<item>I had boarded the bus from Khurja and was supposed to go<lb/> to Bypass Bulandshahr -Jahagirabad. At the time of<lb/> accident owner was not present in the bus. I was travelling<lb/> in the bus in a standing position on the back gate of the bus.<lb/></item>

			<item>I had seen a passenger carrying cylinder of 5 kg. The<lb/> driver had charged more amount for the said cylinder. I do<lb/> not know the name of said passenger had boarded the bus<lb/> from Khurja. I do not know whether any passenger was<lb/> igniting by ‗Beedi&apos; or not. There was a smell of gas in the<lb/> bus just about 500 mtrs before Qutubpur. I do not know<lb/> whether any passenger was trying to stop any passenger<lb/> igniting the ‗Beedi&apos; or not. It is wrong to suggest that there<lb/> was no fault on the part of the driver for the said accident.<lb/></item>

			<item>(Vol. The driver was negligent as he did not stop the bus<lb/> despite request regarding the smell of gas in bus). I had<lb/> jumped out of the bus just 25-30 mtrs. before the spot of<lb/> accident when I heard noise from inside the bus that there is<lb/> a smell of gas. It is correct that the road on which the bus<lb/> was running was in a bad condition. It is wrong to suggest<lb/> that I was not traveling in the said bus. It is wrong to<lb/> suggest that I am not an eye witness of the accident. I have<lb/> come to depose before the court on asking of claimants, my<lb/> evidence affidavit was prepared by the ld counsel for<lb/> claimants. It is wrong to suggest that the driver / conductor<lb/> had not permitted the carrying of cylinder in the bus. It is<lb/> wrong to suggest that driver / conductor did not know about<lb/> the cylinder in the bus. It is wrong to suggest that I am<lb/> deposing falsely to favor the claimants.<lb/></item>

			<item>xxxxxxx by Mr. V K Gupta, Adv for defendant no. 4 /<lb/> insurance company.<lb/></item>

			<item>In between the bus had stopped for about 15 -20<lb/> times after I boarded the bus and where I jumped out of the<lb/> bus. I felt the smell of gas after about 1 hour of my<lb/> boarding the bus. I did not tell the driver about the smell of<lb/> gas in bus. It is wrong to suggest that I did not see the gas<lb/> cylinder in the bus. The fire had broken out in the bus in the<lb/> middle portion of the bus. There were 80 -90 passengers<lb/> in the bus and the bus was fully packed, all the seats were<lb/> full and the passengers were packed in standing positions<lb/> and even 8 -10 passengers were travelling on the roof of<lb/> the bus. Even some passengers were traveling on the entry /<lb/> exit gates of the bus. It is wrong to suggest that the said bus<lb/> no. DL-1PA-0359 has falsely been involved in this case. It<lb/> is wrong to suggest that I am not eye witness of the accident<lb/> nor I was traveling in the said bus. It is wrong to suggest<lb/> that I am deposing falsely to favour the claimants. It is<lb/> wrong to suggest that inspite of gas leakage I as well as the<lb/> other passengers did not take any step for removal of the<lb/> gas cylinder from the bus or that I as well as other<lb/> passengers were themselves responsible for the accident. It<lb/> is wrong to suggest that my claim is false or that I am<lb/> deposing falsely.‖<lb/></item>

			<item>29. In MACT 197/2006 the claimant-Ganesh Chand&quot;s evidence by way<lb/> of an affidavit, is as under:<lb/></item>

			<item>-I, Ganesh Chand Sharma S/o Sh. Ramesh Chand Sharma,a<lb/> aged about 44 years R/o K-II-9, Block-K-II, Sangam Vihar,<lb/> Delhi-62, do hereby solemnly affirm &amp; declare as under:<lb/> ......<lb/></item>

			<item>2.<lb/> That the deponent along with his wife has filed the<lb/> above noted matter for getting the compensation on account of<lb/> premature death of his son due to injuries sustained by him on<lb/> 22.09.2014 when he was Travelling in the Bus bearing No. DL<lb/> 1PA 0359, the petition bears the signature of the deponent and<lb/> the same is correct and the contents of the petition may kindly<lb/> be read as part and parcel of this affidavit. The petitioners are<lb/> entitled to get compensation as claimed by them in the petition.<lb/></item>

			<item>3.<lb/> That on the most unfortunate day of 22.09.2014 my<lb/> Son namely Santosh &amp; his friend Govind boarding the Bus<lb/> bearing No. DL 1PA 0359 from Khurja for going to<lb/> Jahagirabad, Bulandashahr U.P. and many other passengers<lb/> were also travelling in the same Bus.<lb/></item>

			<item>4.<lb/> That the conductor as well as the driver of the said Bus<lb/> was very careless &amp; negligent towards his duty and<lb/> intentionally &amp; knowingly carrying the goods in the said Bus<lb/> which was prohibited by Law for fetching the huge amount by<lb/> illegal means, inspite of the objections raised by the<lb/> passengers they have loaded the Gas cylinder in the Bus<lb/> without carrying the life of passengers. The Bus driven by its<lb/> driver at a very high speed and negligent manner, at about<lb/> 5.15 p.m. when the Bus reached near Village Kutubpur on<lb/> Jahagirabad road there was a smell of gas spread in the Bus<lb/> due to lekage of gas from Cylinder. The passengers asked the<lb/> driver as well as conductor of the Bus to stop the Bus as there<lb/> was leakage of Gas but the driver as well as conductor did not<lb/> pay any attention towards the request made by the passengers<lb/> and drove the Bus at a very high speed and carelessly<lb/> resulting whereof the gas caught fire and spread into the bus<lb/> and made a heavy blast.<lb/></item>

			<item>5.<lb/> That after hearing huge and crying of the passengers<lb/> due to heavy burning, public person gathered on spot and try<lb/> to set off the fire and made a call to the police, after some time<lb/> police arrived on spot and all the injured were taken to the<lb/> Govt. Hospital, Bulandshahr U.P. but due to the serious<lb/> condition my son was refer to and admitted in Safdarjung<lb/> Hospital New Delhi on the same day, where he died during the<lb/> course of treatment on 04.10.2014 and post mortem was<lb/> conducted by the Doctor&apos;s.<lb/></item>

			<item>6.<lb/> That due to the carelessly and negligently act of the<lb/> driver and conductor of the Bus many passengers were burnt<lb/> resulting into their deaths and some also badly burnt and a<lb/> Case Crime No. 319/2014 U/S 285/337/338/427 IPC was<lb/> registered at P.S. Shikarpur, Distt. Bulandshahr U.P. against<lb/> the respondents.<lb/></item>

			<item>7.<lb/> That this accident has absolutely been caused due to<lb/> rash &amp; negligent driving of respondent no. 1. Had the<lb/> respondent no.1 been vigilant, cautious enough and ought to<lb/> have driven the vehicle in question by observing proper look<lb/> out and taking necessary precautious and pay attention<lb/> towards the request made by the passengers, the said accident<lb/> has been very easily averted and the deceased could not<lb/> sustained fatal injuries. It is the duty of the respondent no. 1<lb/> to drive the vehicle in question by observing the Traffic rules.‖<lb/></item>

			<p>30. The aforesaid testimony makes it clear that the bus was carrying over<lb/> 80 to 90 passengers, eight to ten passengers were travelling on the roof of<lb/> the bus as well. The accident happened on account of explosion of a gas<lb/> cylinder which was being carried by a passenger in the bus. Who knows,<lb/> the driver might have charged him more money for carrying the said gas<lb/> filled cylinder in the bus. The passenger concerned had boarded the bus<lb/> from Khurja. He denied the suggestion that the driver or conductor had not<lb/> permitted the carrying of the cylinder in the bus. The dangerous and<lb/> combustible substance was permitted by the conductor and the driver to be<lb/> carried in an overcrowded passenger bus, exposing everybody in it to<lb/> extreme harm. Sadly, the harm did occur as a result. The harm could have<lb/> been averted, had the conductor and the bus driver been vigilant and/or paid<lb/> heed to the requests of the various passengers.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. PW-2, Subhash, by way of affidavit, had further deposed as under:<lb/> -</p>

			<item>...<lb/></item>

			<item>4....<lb/> The passengers asked the driver as well as conductor<lb/> of the Bus to stop the Bus as there was leakage of Gas but<lb/> the driver as well as conductor did not pay any attention<lb/> towards the request made by the passengers and drove the<lb/> Bus at a very high speed and carelessly resulting whereof<lb/> the gas caught fire and spread into the bus and made a<lb/> heavy blast.‖<lb/></item>

			<p>32. There is nothing on record to show that the conductor was qualified<lb/> and/or licensed to undertake such duties. Under the Motor Vehicle Act,<lb/> 1988, a bus can ferry passenger on a route only with a qualified conductor.<lb/> In the present case, there was nothing of this sort. This too shows<lb/> callousness of the driver towards the safety and security of the passengers.<lb/> Surely, neither the driver cared about the safety of the passengers nor did the<lb/> conductor have the sensitivity, alacrity or care about human safety.<lb/></p>

			<p>33. The Court is of the view that even if the person officiating as the<lb/> conductor, was not duly licensed or trained as a bus conductor, he would<lb/> have very well known that carrying of a gas cylinder in a bus packed with<lb/> passengers was to put to threat the lives of everybody travelling in it. All<lb/> the more, when there were repeated calls that there was leakage of gas in the<lb/> bus. For the driver to rush-on despite the entreaties and requests of the<lb/> passengers, establishes callousness, rashness and negligence on his part.<lb/> The tragedy occurred because of the rash and negligent driving of the<lb/> insured vehicle. The claims are maintainable under s. 140 and 164 of the<lb/> M.V. Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>34. Therefore, the impugned order is set aside. The compensation shall<lb/> be payable by the insurer, with right to recover the same from the<lb/> owner/driver of the offending vehicle in terms of Mukund Dewangan vs<lb/> Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. (2017) 14 SCC 663 and Shamanna &amp; Anr vs<lb/> Divisional Manager, The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors (2018) 9 SCC<lb/> 650.<lb/></p>

			<p>35. The Court would note that as per the Cover Note, the liability of the<lb/> insurer extends only to 52 passengers. No claim had been referred to the<lb/> insurance company for the driver and conductor. The latter have been<lb/> compensated ex-gratia by the State Government to some extent, i.e. apropos<lb/> their injuries. Be that as it may, the insurer is liable to pay compensation for<lb/> claims apropos the 52 persons only, the total number of onboard passengers<lb/> was 82, out of which 31 had died and 51 others have been injured. In the<lb/> circumstances, the highest amount payable in 52 claim petitions shall be<lb/> considered and this amount shall be distributed on pro-rata basis amongst<lb/> the claimants.<lb/></p>

			<p>36. It is noted that 33 appeals have been filed by the insurance company<lb/> while the remaining 29 appeals have been filed by the claimants seeking<lb/> enhancement of the compensation amount, on the ground that minimum<lb/> wages ought to have been considered while granting compensation towards<lb/> &quot;loss of dependency&quot;. The Claim Petitions filed under sections 166 and 140<lb/> of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 were converted by the learned Tribunal into<lb/> one for liability under section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.<lb/></p>

			<p>37. Insofar, this Court has already held that there was clear rashness and<lb/> negligence on part of the driver in plying the bus, with knowledge to him<lb/> and the bus conductor that a hazardous substance i.e. a gas cylinder being<lb/> carried by a passenger, which was leaking, leading to an explosion of the gas<lb/> cylinder and resultant fatalities and injuries to many of the passengers, the<lb/> case would have to be assessed on the basis of evidence led by the parties<lb/> for assessment of &quot;loss of dependency&quot;, etc. The learned counsel for the<lb/> insurer states that the written arguments did allude to and address all the<lb/> issues argued before this Court, but the learned Tribunal erred in not<lb/> considering the same.<lb/></p>

			<p>38. In terms of the aforesaid conclusion, the cases are remanded for<lb/> assessment of compensation on the basis of individual claims under section<lb/> 164 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Since the accident happened on<lb/> 22.09.2014, almost half a decade ago, the learned Tribunal is requested to<lb/> dispose-off the claim petitions within a period of four months from the date<lb/> when the case is next listed before it. LCR be returned to the learned<lb/> Tribunal before the aforesaid date. The parties shall lead their evidence in<lb/> support of their claims. The learned counsel for the parties submit that they<lb/> will the assist the learned Tribunal on every date when the case is so listed<lb/> and shall not seek an adjournment in the matter.<lb/></p>

			<p>39. The insurance company has already deposited the minimum<lb/> compensation amount under section 163 A Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, which<lb/> is, in any case, the minimum amount payable to the claimants. Let the same<lb/> be released to the beneficiaries of the respective awards in terms of the<lb/> scheme of disbursement specified therein.<lb/></p>

			<p>40. The release of the said monies shall be subject to adjustments in case<lb/> there is enhancement of compensation by the learned Tribunal.<lb/></p>

			<p>41. The statutory amounts, alongwith interest accrued thereon, shall be<lb/> retained in the FDRs and shall be subject to adjustments, in case there is<lb/> enhancement of compensation by the learned Tribunal.<lb/></p>

			<p>42. The appeals are disposed-off in the above terms.<lb/></p>
