			<p>they do not possess the qualification has been declined and the writ<lb/> petitions have been dismissed with certain observations.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. We had heard the arguments that had been advanced by<lb/> the learned counsel for the parties on 22.11.2019, whereupon we<lb/> had passed the following order:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Heard learned counsel for the parties.<lb/></item>

			<item>2. We find from the submissions that have been<lb/> advanced that the basic issue involved is with regard to<lb/> the eligibility qualifications being possessed by the<lb/> appellants, who contend that their candidature could<lb/> not have been declared to be not in accordance with<lb/> the qualifications prescribed inasmuch as the<lb/> certificates possessed by them are in conformity with<lb/> law and heavy reliance has been placed on the Division<lb/> Bench judgment dated 20.08.2019 to contend that the<lb/> respondents are bound to apply the ratio of the said<lb/> judgment in the case of the appellants as well.<lb/></item>

			<item>3. The question as to whether the appellants are in<lb/> possession of the qualifications or not is being debated<lb/> before us on the ground that the qualifications<lb/> possessed by them should be treated to be equivalent<lb/> ___________<lb/></item>

			<item>Page 3 of 15<lb/> http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/> as per the norms adopted by the Government itself in<lb/> the past to the qualifications prescribed in the<lb/> Notification dated 26.07.2017.<lb/></item>

			<item>4. We, prima facie, find that the Notification dated<lb/> 26.07.2017 does not appear to have been challenged<lb/> and the appellants had applied under the same<lb/> Notification supporting their candidature by the<lb/> qualifications that they possessed. The question of<lb/> equivalence therefore has to be gathered either from<lb/> the recitals contained in the Notification or even<lb/> otherwise if the appellants are able to satisfy the Court<lb/> that they are in possession of the equivalent<lb/> qualification.<lb/></item>

			<item>5. Learned counsel for the appellants pray that the<lb/> matter may be adjourned for today to enable them to<lb/> prepare a Chart and then proceed with the matter<lb/> keeping in view the nature of queries that had been<lb/> raised by the Bench.<lb/></item>

			<item>Put up on 06.12.2019, as prayed for.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>3. The matter was adjourned on 6.12.2019 by the following<lb/> ___________<lb/> Page 4 of 15<lb/> http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/> order:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the<lb/> equivalence issue involved in the present case is being<lb/> addressed by the Government itself and there is every<lb/> likelihood of an outcome of the said proposal, which is<lb/> pending consideration before the State Government.<lb/></item>

			<item>2. Learned Government Pleader may enquire about the<lb/> same and obtain instructions and inform this Court<lb/> about any development in this matter.<lb/></item>

			<p>The Hon&apos;ble Madurai Bench of Madras High Court in its order first read above<lb/> has issued the following judgment:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;... the Government is directed to constitute an Equivalence<lb/> Committee so as to find whether the diploma acquired by Writ<lb/> Petitions can be declared equivalent to the qualifications referred in<lb/> the Notification as well as in the Service rules...&quot;<lb/></item>

In the letters second and third read above, the Director of School Education<lb/> has sent proposals of the Government seeking orders of the Government on the<lb/> equivalence of the Diploma acquired by the Writ Petitioners in W.P.(MD)<lb/> No.21650/2018 and other cases and also equivalence for certain other courses<lb/> offered by Educational Institutions respectively.<lb/></item>

			<item>3. In the Government Order 4 th read above, the existing Equivalence<lb/> Committee functioning under the Chairmanship of Tamil Nadu Public Service<lb/> Commission was disbanded and a new Equivalence Committee has been constituted<lb/> in its place, under the Chairmanship of the Principal Secretary to Government, Higher<lb/> Education Department for issuance of equivalence to the courses offered by the<lb/> ___________<lb/> Page 9 of 15<lb/> http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/> Educational institutions for the purpose of employment in public services and for<lb/> pursuing higher studies.<lb/></item>

			<item>4. Based on the minutes of the first Equivalence Committee meeting held on<lb/> 31.07.2019 received in letter 5 th read above, orders have been issued by the<lb/> Government for equivalence of the Educational Qualifications in Government Order<lb/> 6 th read above and non equivalence of the Educational Qualifications in Government<lb/> Order 7 th read above.<lb/></item>

			<item>5.

			<item>Sl.No.<lb/> Resolution<lb/> Recommendation<lb/></item>

			<item>1.<lb/> Resolution No:111<lb/> Public Services -Educational Qualifications -<lb/>Consideration of D.P.Ed. Offered by Annamalai<lb/> university &amp; Bharathiar University as to<lb/> whether equivalent to H.P.Ed., to the purpose<lb/> of Employment in Public Services<lb/> Equivalent<lb/></item>

			<item>2.<lb/> Resolution No.112<lb/> Public Services -Educational Qualification -<lb/>Consideration of M.P.Ed., (Direct) 2 year<lb/> degree course offered by University of Madras<lb/> as to whether equivalent to B.P.Ed., (one<lb/> year) and M.P.Ed., (One year) to the purpose<lb/> of Employment in Public Services.<lb/></item>

			<item>Equivalent<lb/></item>

 3.<lb/> Resolution No.113<lb/> Public Services -Educational Qualification -<lb/>Consideration of C.P.Ed., offered by Karnataka<lb/> State as to whether equivalent to Lower<lb/> Grade/Higher Grade course of the Director of<lb/> Government Exams, Tamil Nadu to the<lb/> purpose of Employment in Public Services.<lb/></item>

			<item>Equivalent<lb/></item>

 6. The Government after careful consideration, decided to accept the above<lb/> resolutions passed in the second Equivalence Committee Meeting held on 06.11.2019<lb/> and direct that the above courses offered by various Universities are equivalent to<lb/> that of the similar courses mentioned therein from the date of issuance of such<lb/> degrees/diploma.<lb/></item>

			<item>Page 12 of 15<lb/> http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/></item>

			<p>5. A perusal of the above Government Orders shows that they<lb/> are in compliance of the directions issued by the High Court<lb/> (Madurai Bench), whereafter an Equivalence Committee was<lb/> constituted and the Equivalence Committee vide its meetings, as<lb/> referred in the Government Orders, proceeded to grant equivalence<lb/> in the manner indicated therein. In the present set of appeals, the<lb/> equivalence as set out is being claimed by the appellants and they<lb/> contend that the said Government Orders cover their cases.<lb/></p>

			<p>6. Learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the<lb/> State has not disputed the issuance of the Government Orders<lb/> aforesaid, but contends that in the event the appellants are covered<lb/> by the said Government Orders, the Government shall consider<lb/> their candidature, provided they fulfill other eligibility conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>7. Having considered the submissions, we find that the<lb/> judgments of the learned Single Judge deserve to be set aside and<lb/> accordingly, the impugned judgments dated 22.2.2019, 27.2.2019,<lb/></p>

			<p>4.3.2019 and 6.3.2019 are set aside with a direction to the<lb/></p>
