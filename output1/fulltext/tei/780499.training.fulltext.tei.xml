			<item>Read this in conjunction with and in continuation of earlier<lb/> proceedings made in previous listing on 13.09.2021, which reads as<lb/> follows:<lb/></item>

			<item>&apos;Mr.R.Senniappan, learned counsel for writ petitioner in<lb/> both the captioned writ petitions is before this virtual Court.<lb/></item>

			<item>2. &apos;WP.No.17959 of 2021&apos; shall be referred to as &apos;senior<lb/> WP&apos; and &apos;WP.No.17961 of 2021&apos; shall be referred to as &apos;junior<lb/> WP&apos;.<lb/></item>

			<item>3. Adverting to impugned orders in senior and junior<lb/></item>

			<item>WPs<lb/> [both<lb/> dated<lb/> 30.06.2021]<lb/> bearing<lb/> reference<lb/> CST:676385/2004-05<lb/> and<lb/> TNGST:3261190/2004-05<lb/> respectively, learned counsel submits that the orders have been<lb/> made under CST Act and TNGST Act, in senior and junior WPs<lb/> respectively, but both are under Section 12 of respective Acts<lb/> and both are revision orders pertaining to assessment year<lb/> 2004-2005.<lb/></item>

			<item>4. Learned counsel, adverting to impugned orders, more<lb/> particularly, No.3 in the reference therein, submits that there<lb/> were two communications, one dated 11.12.2020 and the other<lb/> dated 08.03.2021 prior to impugned orders, both of which<lb/> pertain to personal hearing. These two personal hearing<lb/> notices read as follows:<lb/></item>

			<item>5. It is learned counsel&apos;s specific say that 11.12.2020<lb/> notice was never served on writ petitioner, on seeing the<lb/> impugned orders, writ petitioner requested for a copy of the<lb/> same and it was given to the writ petitioner only on 27.07.2021<lb/> post impugned orders. Be that as it may, with regard to<lb/> 08.03.2021 personal hearing notice, learned counsel submits<lb/> that writ petitioner had sent a detailed reply dated 11.03.2021,<lb/> saying that Covid-19 situation and the lock down is delaying<lb/> the collection of 15 year old documents and some time has<lb/> been requested, but notwithstanding the same the impugned<lb/> orders have been passed without giving personal hearing.<lb/></item>

			<item>6. Ms.Amirta Dinakaran, learned Revenue counsel<lb/> accepts notice on behalf of sole respondent and requests for a<lb/> short accommodation to get instructions.<lb/> List in the Admission Board day after tomorrow i.e.,<lb/></item>

			<item>15.09.2021.&apos;<lb/></item>

			<p>2. Mr.R.Senniappan, learned counsel for writ petitioner in both the<lb/> captioned writ petitions and Ms.Amirta Dinakaran, learned Revenue<lb/> counsel for the lone respondent in both the captioned writ petitions are<lb/> before me.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. Before proceeding further, regarding paragraph 3 of previous<lb/> proceedings dated 13.09.2021, I deem it appropriate to make it clear that<lb/> the impugned order in the senior WP, which has been made under CST<lb/> Act is under Section 12 of CST Act read with Section 9(2A) of CST Act,<lb/> whereas, impugned order in junior WP has been made under Section 12<lb/> per se of TNGST Act. To this extent, paragraph 3 of the previous<lb/> proceedings shall stand corrected.<lb/></p>

			<p>4. Reverting to the core issue i.e., issue captured in the previous<lb/> proceedings, learned Revenue counsel, on instructions submits that the<lb/> first notice dated 11.12.2020 was returned &apos;unserved&apos; and to the second<lb/> notice dated 08.03.2021, writ petitioner did respond citing the Covid-19<lb/> situation and sought time. In other words, there is no disputation that the<lb/> first notice dated 11.12.2020 was made available to the writ petitioner<lb/> only on 27.07.2021 post impugned order.<lb/></p>

			<p>5. Regarding service of notices, the applicable Rules are the &apos;Tamil<lb/> Nadu General Sales Tax Rules, 1959&apos; [hereinafter &apos;TNGST Rules&apos; for the<lb/> sake of convenience]. To be noted, this Court is informed without any<lb/> disputation or disagreement that TNGST Rules is applicable with regard<lb/> to proceedings under CST Act also. The Rules that deals with services of<lb/> notices is Rule 52 and the relevant Rule in this case is 52(1)(d), which<lb/> reads as follows:<lb/> &apos;Rule 52 (1): Service of notices: The service on a dealer<lb/> of any notice, summons or order under the Act or these rules<lb/> may be effected in any of the following ways, namely:-<lb/></p>

			<item>R.52(1)(a) ..............<lb/></item>

			<item>R.52(1)(b) ..............<lb/></item>

			<item>R.52(1)(c) ..............<lb/></item>

			<item>R.52(1)(d) if none of the modes aforesaid is practicable,<lb/> by affixing it in some conspicuous place at his last known place<lb/> of business or residence.&apos;<lb/></item>

			<p>6. In the case on hand, there is no disputation that there was no<lb/> affixure much less affixure in the conspicuous place at his last known<lb/> place of business/residence qua writ petitioner. Therefore, there was no<lb/> service of notice as far as the 11.12.2020 notice is concerned. Therefore,<lb/> following order is passed:<lb/></p>

			<item>a) Impugned orders being orders (both) dated<lb/> 30.06.2021 bearing reference CST:676385/2004-05 and<lb/> TNGST:3261190/2004-05 respectively are set aside solely on<lb/> the ground that pre order notices have not been served in<lb/> accordance with TNGST Rules;<lb/></item>

			<item>b) Though obvious, it is made clear that the impugned<lb/> orders are set aside solely on the ground that pre order notices<lb/> have not been served in accordance with prescribed procedure,<lb/> no opinion or view has been expressed on the merits of the<lb/> matter;<lb/></item>

			<item>c) Respondent in both the writ petitions shall commence<lb/> the proceedings afresh, serve notices on the writ petitioner in<lb/> accordance with prescribed procedure and conclude the<lb/> proceedings as expeditiously as his business would permit and<lb/> in any event within twelve(12) weeks from today i.e., on or<lb/> before 08.12.2021.<lb/></item>

			<p>7. Writ petitions disposed of with the above directives. There shall<lb/> be no order as to costs. Consequently, connected WMPs are also<lb/> disposed of as closed.<lb/></p>

			<p>15.09.2021<lb/> Speaking/Non-speaking order<lb/> Index: Yes/No<lb/> kmi<lb/> To<lb/> The State Tax Officer,<lb/> Attur(Town) Assessment Circle<lb/> Attur.<lb/></p>
